According to a fellow named Chris\nGoodfellow, the plane caught fire, and the pilot headed to a nearby airport to\nsave the craft, eventually crashing into the Indian Ocean.\nGoodfellow originally posted his theory on his Google+ page on 14 March, but\nit picked up steam when it was reposted on the linking site Reddit. On Tuesday\nWired magazine edited and ran the post under the headline A Startlingly Simple\nTheory about the Missing Malaysia Airlines Jet.\nGoodfellow, whom Wired identifies as having \"20 years' experience as a\nCanadian Class-1 instrumented-rated pilot for multi-engine planes\", begins\nwith a dismissive wave toward the aviation experts who have been clogging the\nnews networks.\n\"There has been a lot of speculation about Malaysia Airlines Flight 370,\" he\nwrites. \"Terrorism, hijacking, meteors. I cannot believe the analysis on CNN;\nit's almost disturbing.\"\nHe says that he \"tends to look for a simpler explanation\".\nHe then theorises that a fire, possibly electrical or from an overheated tyre\non take-off, sent smoke into the cockpit shortly after the crew signs off with\nMalaysian air traffic controllers.\nThe pilot executes a sharp left turn and heads for a nearby emergency landing\nspot, while turning off electronics - such as the transponder - in order to\nisolate the problem.\n\"Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a very experienced senior captain with 18,000 hours of\nflight time,\" he writes. \"We old pilots were drilled to know what is the\nclosest airport of safe harbour while in cruise.\"\nA quick search of Google Earth gives Goodfellow a candidate: Pulau Langkawi.\n\"Surprisingly, none of the reporters, officials, or other pilots interviewed\nhave looked at this from the pilot's viewpoint: If something went wrong, where\nwould he go?\" he writes. \"Thanks to Google Earth I spotted Langkawi in about\n30 seconds, zoomed in and saw how long the runway was and I just instinctively\nknew this pilot knew this airport.\"\nAll the pieces fit into place, he writes. The climb to 45,000ft? A last-ditch\nattempt to put out the fire. Where is the plane now? After the pilots were\novercome by smoke, the plane continued on autopilot over Langkawi and headed\nwest into the Indian Ocean, where it eventually ran out of fuel and crashed.\n\"Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a hero struggling with an impossible situation\ntrying to get that plane to Langkawi,\" he writes. \"There is no doubt in my\nmind. That's the reason for the turn and direct route.\"\nGoodfellow's theory continued to spread across media, both social and\nmainstream.\n\"I buy this new MH370 theory of an onboard fire,\" tweeted the New York Times's\nJosh Barro.\nThe theory \"fits the facts\" and \"makes sense\", writes Business Insider's Henry\nBlodget. \"It requires no fantastically brilliant pre-planning or execution or\nmotives.\"\nThe Atlantic's James Fallows agrees.\n\"I think there's doubt about everything concerning this flight. But his\nexplanation makes better sense than anything else I've heard so far,\" he\nwrites. \"It's one of the few that make me think, Yes, I could see things\nhappening that way.\"\nOnly it very likely didn't happen that way - as considerable information that\nwas already in the public realm contradicts the story. By Tuesday evening,\nwriters and commentators were picking Goodfellow's post apart.\n\"Goodfellow's account is emotionally compelling, and it is based on some of\nthe most important facts that have been established so far,\" writes Jeff Wise\nin Slate. \"And it is simple - to a fault.\"\n\"While it's true that MH370 did turn toward Langkawi and wound up overflying\nit, whoever was at the controls continued to manoeuvre after that point as\nwell, turning sharply right at VAMPI waypoint, then left again at GIVAL,\" he\nsays. \"Such vigorous navigating would have been impossible for unconscious\nmen.\"\nAnd:\n_Goodfellow's theory fails further when one remembers the electronic ping\ndetected by the Inmarsat satellite at 8:11 on the morning of March 8.\nAccording to analysis provided by the Malaysian and United States governments,\nthe pings narrowed the location of MH370 at that moment to one of two arcs,\none in Central Asia and the other in the southern Indian Ocean. As MH370 flew\nfrom its original course toward Langkawi, it was headed toward neither.\nWithout human intervention - which would go against Goodfellow's theory - it\nsimply could not have reached the position we know it attained at 8:11 a.m._\nThere still should have been a distress call, Greg Feith, a former National\nTransportation Safety Board crash investigator, told NBC News.\n\"Typically, with an electrical fire, you'll have smoke before you have fire,\"\nhe said. \"You can do some troubleshooting. And if the systems are still up and\nrunning, you can get off a mayday call\" and pilots can put on an oxygen mask,\nFeith said.\nNine hours after its first article on the subject Business Insider ran a\nfollow-up, with reaction from pilots.\nMichael G Fortune, a retired pilot who flew 777-200ERs like the Malaysia\nplane, said it was unlikely the crew would have shut off the transponders to\ndeal with the fire.\n\"The checklist I utilized for smoke and fumes in the B-777-200ER does not\nspecifically address the transponder being turned off,\" he said.\nAnother 777 pilot told the website that putting on oxygen masks would have\nbeen the first priority for the crew, preventing them from being\nincapacitated.\nAs long as there is no definitive word about the fate of MH370, theories -\nfrom respected experts and amateurs relying on a hunch and a little help from\nGoogle Earth - will continue to bounce around the internet.\nSome will catch on and go viral, until they are debunked or overtaken by new\nfacts.\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/mh370-pilot-was-trying-to-save-plane-from-fire-claims-new-theory", "content": "You don't have permission to access /asia/se-asia/mh370-pilot-was-trying-to-\nsave-plane-from-fire-claims-new-theory on this server.  \n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.ibtimes.com/what-happened-mh370-everyone-knows-theoretically-1598716", "content": "A week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished in mid-flight, hobby pilot\nand aviation enthusiast Keith Ledgerwood decided to investigate theories\nrelated to its disappearance. Armed only with available civilian radar and\namateur knowledge, he found unusual coincidences and decided to share them\nwith the world.\nHis blog post contending that MH370 shadowed another aircraft went viral and\nis considered one of the more plausible, if dauntingly intricate, alternate\ntheories about what happened to the plane.\nLedgerwood proposed that MH370 didn't fly south, as is the consensus among\nexperts based upon available data. Instead, he says, it headed north and flew\nin the shadow of another commercial flight, Singapore Airlines Flight 68,\nwhich was en route from Singapore to Barcelona at the time. This would\neffectively cloak MH370\u2019s radar signal and prevent it from being detected, he\nwrote.\nLedgerwood\u2019s theory is among countless attempts to explain what happened to\nthe Boeing-777 with 239 people onboard. Suspected terrorism, government cover-\nups, pilot suicide, mechanical failures and even an alien abduction scenario\nhave all been proposed by observers who range from technical experts to former\npilots, government officials and armchair analysts who may or may not have an\ninformed clue. The lack of proof makes it impossible to prove or disprove any\nof them. Theoretically, anything is possible.\nLedgerwood, a 30-year-old IT professional from Cincinnati who has a pilot\u2019s\nlicense and has flown air simulators since he was a teenager, decided to go\npublic with his idea after concluding that no one else had proposed a logical\nexplanation.\n\u201cNo one in the media, no Malaysian official had published anything up to that\npoint or spoken to the fact that the aircraft was anywhere near the Singapore\nAirlines flight at the time of its disappearance,\u201d Ledgerwood told\nInternational Business Times.\nSoon after he published the blog post, Ledgerwood was being cited in news\narticles and contacted by experts who wanted to determine the credibility of\nhis theory.\n\u201cThe theory stayed plausible,\u201d Ledgerwood maintained. His scenario describes\nhow the plane would fly undetected by radar beneath the Singapore Airlines\ncommercial jet -- either controlled by the pilot or co-pilot for presumably\ncriminal purposes -- until it lands in China\u2019s Xingjian province, Kyrgyzstan\nor Turkmenistan. These locations line up with the Singapore Airline's 7.5-hour\nflight time and the last known ping emitted by MH370, he said.\nHe sent his findings to Inmarsat, the satellite communications company that\nhelped triangulate the hourly pings the aircraft sent to its satellites.\nAccording to Ledgerwood, the company pulled satellite data from both MH370 and\nthe Singapore Airlines 68 to see whether his theory held up. He says his\nanalysis got shelved when the company used the Doppler Effect and determined\nthat the plane\u2019s flight path most likely headed south and that the Boeing-777\ncrashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.\nFor Les Abend, a Boeing-777 pilot who has worked for a major U.S. airline for\n30 years (he declined to name the airline), Ledgerwood\u2019s scenario is \u201ctotal\nnonsense.\u201d Not only would the Singapore Airlines flight be aware of MH370\u2019s\npresence using its onboard equipment, but the timing would have to be exact,\nhe said.\nRobert Mann, a veteran airline industry analyst with expert knowledge in air\ntraffic control systems, has yet another take. He said it\u2019s possible the MH370\ncould have shadowed another aircraft of similar size, but that the maneuver\nwould be extremely complex.\nSince both of the aircraft\u2019s radar devices were off (for reasons that have yet\nto be determined), it\u2019s conceivable that the plane could approach another\nwithout detection, Mann said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s, in theory, possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, can you expect a\ncommercial pilot to fly close in trail to another commercial aircraft? It\u2019s at\nnight and formation flying is difficult to begin with in a small aircraft.\nIt\u2019s particularly difficult in a large aircraft where you have trailing wind\nvortex and other considerations.\u201d\nLedgerwood isn\u2019t the only \u201camateur\u201d who has authored an MH370 theory. Nigel\nCawthorne, a journalist based in Britain, recently wrote a book about the\nplane\u2019s disappearance in which he outlined many of the conspiracy theories\nthat have emerged.\nThe book, published less than 11 weeks after MH370 vanished, has been\ncriticized as insensitive, premature and conjectural. Cawthorne has sought to\ndefend himself against these claims, including on an Australian television\nshow on which the co-host read a sentence from the book that asked, \u201cDid they\ndie painlessly unaware of their fate or did they die in terror in a flaming\nwreck crashing from the sky at the hands of a madman?\u201d Cawthorne conceded the\npassage was \u201ccolorful.\u201d\nIn an email to IBTimes, Cawthorne said the timing of the book\u2019s publication\nwas up to the publishers and that many of his detractors are guilty of some of\nthe same accusations made against him.\n\u201cThe criticism of insensitivity was leveled at me by TV presenters who are\nhappy to run the story on their shows, which reach a far wider audience than I\ncould ever hope to with my book. They certainly showed no sensitivity to the\nfeelings of the families,\u201d he said.\nAnother article objected to the book\u2019s government cover-up theory in which the\nplane was shot down in a U.S.-Thai military exercise.\n\u201cThe book did not say that. It simply raised it as one of the theories that\nwas doing the rounds,\u201d Cawthorne said. \u201cI have taken all the theories and\nknocked them down. In my experience, governments can barely run a candy store,\nlet alone organize a grand conspiracy. I don't believe that there are dark\nforces behind the scenes pulling the strings. People in power just aren't that\ncompetent.\u201d\nJonathan Gilliam, a former FBI special agent and federal air marshal,\ndisagrees with Cawhorne\u2019s assessment that governments are incapable of such a\ncover-up. \u201cOne thing that I definitely suspect as a possibility is that\nMalaysia shot that plane down,\u201d Gilliam said.\nHis hunch stems from one of the initial reports that described MH370 pilot\nZaharie Ahmad Shah as a supporter of Anwar Ibrahim, the leader of the\nopposition to Malaysia\u2019s ruling party. Ibrahim was convicted on sodomy charges\nhours before the doomed flight departed, and the pilot had been present in the\ncourtroom.\n\u201cThis plane was flown by a guy who just left a sentencing of an opposition to\nthe standing political party or administration in Malaysia. He goes from there\nand gets on a plane. He takes that plane, he flies and turns around and flies\nback at Malaysia,\u201d Gilliam said. In such a scenario, he said, the Malaysian\nmilitary would have scrambled jets to intercept it.\nGilliam cited the very lack of evidence as evidence: In his view, government\nofficials have intentionally not located the wreckage of the plane because\nthey shot it down.\nAs for reports that pings were heard from the plane\u2019s black box during the\nsearch off the coast of Australia, which were later determined to have come\nfrom a man-made device, Gilliam argued such sounds could easily be replicated\nas a distraction. Pingers can be bought from aircraft suppliers and are\nenabled by placing them in water, he said, adding, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been\ndifficult to throw one of those off a ship in 20,000 feet of water and cause\nhysteria.\u201d\nThere were also flaws in the search effort itself, Gilliam said. If the plane\nwas shot down as he posited, the search area would be located near Malaysia --\nspecifically off the country\u2019s western coast.\n\u201cWhen the plane turned, it went back across Malaysia and north. That\u2019s one of\nthe only places where they never really searched,\u201d Gilliam said. \u201cThey\nsearched in between Malaysia and Vietnam. They searched all the way down by\nAustralia but they never searched heavily the southwest coast of Malaysia.\nThis is another stretch but I think it\u2019s another plausible theory no one has\nlooked at.\u201d\nGilliam added that the aircraft involved in the aerial search weren't used to\ntheir full capacity. That is, since the planes had to fly more than 1,000\nmiles each way to reach the search area, they didn\u2019t have enough fuel to stay\nin the air for long before heading back to land. Gilliam said this wasn\u2019t\nnecessary -- that the planes have the ability to be refueled midair, and doing\nso would have given them more time to survey the area.\n\u201cTo have planes flying 2,000 miles and landing is kind of ridiculous when you\ncould have sent a refueling plane there to keep them on station all the time,\u201d\nhe said.\nGilliam stops short of speculating about a government cover-up -- though if\nhis theory is correct, it would mean the government covered up having downed\nthe plane -- and says he understands why countries may need to conceal certain\nkinds of information.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying governments made the plane disappear. If they had to shoot it\ndown and want to keep [Malaysia] from being attacked from China or causing an\ninternational incident, I can see some things being taken care of. That is as\nbig of an assumption as saying the plane went north into Pakistan or\nAfghanistan,\u201d he said.\nAbend, the pilot, maintains that the plane likely crashed due to a mechanical\nfailure, but says he once believed the plane might have gone down in a jungle\nas opposed to the ocean. It was only after he spoke to one of the VPs at\nInmarsat that he became convinced the aircraft crashed in water, as the\nsatellite company claims.\n\u201cI walked through all nefarious scenarios,\u201d he said. That includes those in\nwhich the pilots were involved in terrorism, he added.\n\u201cThe co-pilot was 27 years old, sitting right-seat in one of the biggest jumbo\njets in the world. He likes his checks. He\u2019s got the world going for him.\nDoesn\u2019t make a lot of sense why he would take this airplane and ruin a great\ncareer to make a statement. There was no indication of this,\u201d Abend said.\nThen there were reports that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah\u2019s wife left him, which\nmay have led him to commit suicide, one of his pilot friends who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity told UK\u2019s Express. Other suicide mission scenarios\npoint to how one of the pilots may have steered the jetliner into a remote\npart of the world on purpose so their family members could still collect life\ninsurance.\n\u201cIf they never find the plane, they can\u2019t call it suicide,\u201d Rep. Pete King\n(R-LI), chair of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism\nand Intelligence told the New York Post.\nThis is what happened with EgyptAir flight 990 in 2002 when the flight\u2019s co-\npilot deliberately killed 217 passengers on board. An investigation found it\nwas an act of revenge after he was reprimanded by the airline for sexual\nmisconduct. His punishment forbade him from flying U.S. routes, which carry\nextra pay. A black box recording revealed how co-pilot Gamil el-Batouty took\ncontrol of the cockpit, forced the plane into a dive, then soared it back up\nto 24,000 feet. The aircraft lost power and broke apart from the stress.\nAbend says there\u2019s no proof that the MH370 pilots were emotionally unstable in\nany way.\n\u201cIf you take the captain and rumors about the fact that maybe his marriage\nwasn\u2019t going great or he had girlfriends -- it\u2019s all alleged,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cThe information released from the FBI shows there\u2019s no indications there\nwould be motivation for this man to commit suicide or a nefarious act. It just\ndoesn\u2019t make sense for this man to take the airplane towards where? The middle\nof the ocean? For what purpose?\u201d\nAs for the theory that one or both of the pilots committed suicide, Abend says\nthat while it may be possible, he discounts it.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to commit suicide, there\u2019s a hell of a lot of better ways to\nreally make a statement. Why take 238 other people with you on this ride? It\njust sounds way too insane for me -- if you take it from the perspective of\nthe crew doing it.\u201d\nAbend doesn\u2019t believe a pilot could easily turn off the plane\u2019s transponder \u2013\nits secondary radar, which transmits the flight speed, identification tag and\ndirection to air traffic control -- to mask its flight path. To do so would\nrequire personally descending into the plane\u2019s electronic bay beneath the\nfirst class cabin and manually shutting it off, and as a pilot himself, Abend\nsaid he would have no idea how to do that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where it is. That\u2019s why in the back of my head I\u2019m always\nsaying something mechanical happened,\u201d he said.\nFor Abend, one of the theories that may fit all the facts is a fire caused by\nthe cargo on board. A cargo manifest for MH370 included 5,440 pounds of\nbatteries.\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge they were loaded in the forward baggage\ncompartment. You can access the forward baggage compartment from the EB\n(electronics bay) compartment. If a fire were to ignite, who knows what it\nwould have burned through,\u201d he said.\nAbend isn\u2019t the only pilot to propose a fire-based theory. Chris Goodfellow,\nan instrument-rated Florida pilot, wrote a blog post that assumed an\nelectrical fire onboard. In his explanation, the plane\u2019s sudden 90-degree turn\nleft was intended to direct the jetliner to a runway on the island of Langkawi\nafter a fire broke out in the cockpit. To stop the fire, the pilots pulled the\ncircuit breakers, which would explain why both radar systems were turned off.\nThe scenario ends with the men unconscious and the plane flying \u201con deep into\nthe south Indian Ocean\u201d until it ran out of fuel and crashed.\nGoodfellow\u2019s theory has been questioned, however, because the plane made two\nother sharp turns that would've been impossible if the pilots were\nunconscious. There was also an electronic ping detected by the Inmarsat\nsatellite that placed the plane on two arcs that wouldn't take it near\nLangkawi without human intervention, Slate\u2019s Jeff Wise pointed out.\n![MH370_satellites](https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2014/06/13/mh370satellites.jpg)\nSatellite data has allowed amateur investigators to map the possible paths of\nMH370.

On June 9, several\nrelatives started a crowdfunding campaign to raise $5 million to spend on an\nindependent investigation to find answers.\n\"The official investigation being run by governments and agencies has failed\nto find the plane, due to either incompetence or obfuscation. We must work\ntogether to ensure the truth is found,\u201d Sarah Bajc, the girlfriend of\npassenger Philip Wood, said on the campaign\u2019s website, which has raised more\nthan $24,000 so far. \u201cOn behalf of the 3.1 billion people who fly every year,\nwe must find the truth and bring those accountable to justice. We must also\nprevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.wired.com/2014/03/mh370-electrical-fire/", "content": "There has been a lot of speculation about Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\nTerrorism, hijacking, meteors. I cannot believe the analysis on CNN; it's\nalmost disturbing. I tend to look for a simpler explanation, and I find it\nwith the 13,000-foot runway at Pulau Langkawi.\nWe know the story of MH370: A loaded Boeing 777 departs at midnight from Kuala\nLampur, headed to Beijing. A hot night. A heavy aircraft. About an hour out,\nacross the gulf toward Vietnam, the plane goes dark, meaning the transponder\nand secondary radar tracking go off. Two days later we hear reports that\nMalaysian military radar (which is a primary radar, meaning the plane is\ntracked by reflection rather than by transponder interrogation response) has\ntracked the plane on a southwesterly course back across the Malay Peninsula\ninto the Strait of Malacca.\nThe left turn is the key here. Zaharie Ahmad Shah1 was a very experienced\nsenior captain with 18,000 hours of flight time. We old pilots were drilled to\nknow what is the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports\nbehind us, airports abeam us, and airports ahead of us. They're always in our\nhead. Always. If something happens, you don't want to be thinking about what\nare you going to do\u2013you already know what you are going to do. When I saw that\nleft turn with a direct heading, I instinctively knew he was heading for an\nairport. He was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000-foot\nairstrip with an approach over water and no obstacles. The captain did not\nturn back to Kuala Lampur because he knew he had 8,000-foot ridges to cross.\nHe knew the terrain was friendlier toward Langkawi, which also was closer.\nTake a look at this airport on Google Earth. The pilot did all the right\nthings. He was confronted by some major event onboard that made him make an\nimmediate turn to the closest, safest airport.\nThe loss of transponders and communications makes perfect sense in a fire.When\nI heard this I immediately brought up Google Earth and searched for airports\nin proximity to the track toward the southwest.\nFor me, the loss of transponders and communications makes perfect sense in a\nfire. And there most likely was an electrical fire. In the case of a fire, the\nfirst response is to pull the main busses and restore circuits one by one\nuntil you have isolated the bad one. If they pulled the busses, the plane\nwould go silent. It probably was a serious event and the flight crew was\noccupied with controlling the plane and trying to fight the fire. Aviate,\nnavigate, and lastly, communicate is the mantra in such situations.\nThere are two types of fires. An electrical fire might not be as fast and\nfurious, and there may or may not be incapacitating smoke. However there is\nthe possibility, given the timeline, that there was an overheat on one of the\nfront landing gear tires, it blew on takeoff and started slowly burning. Yes,\nthis happens with underinflated tires. Remember: Heavy plane, hot night, sea\nlevel, long-run takeoff. There was a well known accident in Nigeria of a DC8\nthat had a landing gear fire on takeoff. Once going, a tire fire would produce\nhorrific, incapacitating smoke. Yes, pilots have access to oxygen masks, but\nthis is a no-no with fire. Most have access to a smoke hood with a filter, but\nthis will last only a few minutes depending on the smoke level. (I used to\ncarry one in my flight bag, and I still carry one in my briefcase when I fly.)\nWhat I think happened is the flight crew was overcome by smoke and the plane\ncontinued on the heading, probably on George (autopilot), until it ran out of\nfuel or the fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed. You will find\nit along that route\u2013looking elsewhere is pointless.\n![lang-660](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2014/03/lang-660.jpg)\nOngoing speculation of a hijacking and/or murder-suicide and that there was a\nflight engineer on board does not sway me in favor of foul play until I am\npresented with evidence of foul play.\nWe know there was a last voice transmission that, from a pilot's point of\nview, was entirely normal. \"Good night\" is customary on a hand-off to a new\nair traffic control. The \"good night\" also strongly indicates to me that all\nwas OK on the flight deck. Remember, there are many ways a pilot can\ncommunicate distress. A hijack code or even transponder code off by one digit\nwould alert ATC that something was wrong. Every good pilot knows keying an SOS\nover the mike always is an option. Even three short clicks would raise an\nalert. So I conclude that at the point of voice transmission all was perceived\nas well on the flight deck by the pilots.\nBut things could have been in the process of going wrong, unknown to the\npilots.\nEvidently the ACARS went inoperative some time before. Disabling the ACARS is\nnot easy, as pointed out. This leads me to believe more in an electrical\nproblem or an electrical fire than a manual shutdown. I suggest the pilots\nprobably were not aware ACARS was not transmitting.\nAs for the reports of altitude fluctuations, given that this was not\ntransponder-generated data but primary radar at maybe 200 miles, the azimuth\nreadings can be affected by a lot of atmospherics and I would not have high\nconfidence in this being totally reliable. But let's accept for a minute that\nthe pilot may have ascended to 45,000 feet in a last-ditch effort to quell a\nfire by seeking the lowest level of oxygen. That is an acceptable scenario. At\n45,000 feet, it would be tough to keep this aircraft stable, as the flight\nenvelope is very narrow and loss of control in a stall is entirely possible.\nThe aircraft is at the top of its operational ceiling. The reported rapid\nrates of descent could have been generated by a stall, followed by a recovery\nat 25,000 feet. The pilot may even have been diving to extinguish flames.\nBut going to 45,000 feet in a hijack scenario doesn't make any good sense to\nme.\nRegarding the additional flying time: On departing Kuala Lampur, Flight 370\nwould have had fuel for Beijing and an alternate destination, probably\nShanghai, plus 45 minutes\u2013say, 8 hours. Maybe more. He burned 20-25 percent in\nthe first hour with takeoff and the climb to cruise. So when the turn was made\ntoward Langkawi, he would have had six hours or more hours worth of fuel. This\ncorrelates nicely with the Inmarsat data pings being received until fuel\nexhaustion.\nFire in an aircraft demands one thing: Get the machine on the ground as soon\nas possible.The now known continued flight until time to fuel exhaustion only\nconfirms to me that the crew was incapacitated and the flight continued on\ndeep into the south Indian ocean.\nThere is no point speculating further until more evidence surfaces, but in the\nmeantime it serves no purpose to malign pilots who well may have been in a\nstruggle to save this aircraft from a fire or other serious mechanical issue.\nCapt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a hero struggling with an impossible situation\ntrying to get that plane to Langkawi. There is no doubt in my mind. That's the\nreason for the turn and direct route. A hijacking would not have made that\ndeliberate left turn with a direct heading for Langkawi. It probably would\nhave weaved around a bit until the hijackers decided where they were taking\nit.\nSurprisingly, none of the reporters, officials, or other pilots interviewed\nhave looked at this from the pilot's viewpoint: If something went wrong, where\nwould he go? Thanks to Google Earth I spotted Langkawi in about 30 seconds,\nzoomed in and saw how long the runway was and I just instinctively knew this\npilot knew this airport. He had probably flown there many times.\nFire in an aircraft demands one thing: Get the machine on the ground as soon\nas possible. There are two well-remembered experiences in my memory. The\nAirCanada DC9 which landed, I believe, in Columbus, Ohio in the 1980s. That\npilot delayed descent and bypassed several airports. He didn't instinctively\nknow the closest airports. He got it on the ground eventually, but lost 30-odd\nsouls. The 1998 crash of Swissair DC-10 off Nova Scotia was another example of\nheroic pilots. They were 15 minutes out of Halifax but the fire overcame them\nand they had to ditch in the ocean. They simply ran out of time. That fire\nincidentally started when the aircraft was about an hour out of Kennedy. Guess\nwhat? The transponders and communications were shut off as they pulled the\nbusses.\nGet on Google Earth and type in Pulau Langkawi and then look at it in relation\nto the radar track heading. Two plus two equals four. For me, that is the\nsimple explanation why it turned and headed in that direction. Smart pilot. He\njust didn't have the time.\n _Chris Goodfellow has 20 years experience as a Canadian Class-1 instrumented-\nrated pilot for multi-engine planes.

Nobody is better. His dissection of the Air France 447 disaster, for\nexample, was brilliant, and his exploration of the 2007 midair collision over\nthe Amazon is one of my all-time favorite aviation pieces. And just a couple\nof months ago I sang the praises of his conclusions on the Malaysia 370\nmystery.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I always agree with him. He knows this. We\u2019ve spoken a few\ntimes and argued a point or two. In no way does it diminish his journalist\nexpertise or his understanding of aviation, but every so often, on this or\nthat point, we see things differently.\nWhich takes us to Langewiesche\u2019s feature in the most recent New York Times\nMagazine, looking into the 737 MAX disasters \u2014 the Lion Air crash in\nparticular. It\u2019s all the things it should be \u2014 exhaustively researched,\ntechnically accurate, eloquently written and styled \u2014 and getting a lot of\nattention. But it leaves me with a very sour feeling.\nIt\u2019s insulting to airline pilots: dismissive, condescending, even a little\nflip. Langewiesche speaks highly of the skills and airmanship of military\npilots, then follows with this of airline pilots: \u201cIt\u2019s a far different\nprotocol for the folks flying us on our vacations and business trips. [These\nare pilots who] never fly solo and whose entire experience consists of\ncatering to passengers. The worst of them are intimidated by their airplanes\nand remain so until they retire or die.\u201d\nIgnoring for a minute that a high percentage of airline pilots are, in fact,\ntrained in the military, this is such a disgustingly insulting description of\nthe piloting profession that I can hardly believe it emanated from the pen of\nsomebody as informed and knowledgeable as William Langewiesche. _Whose entire\nexperience consists of catering to passengers?_ Wow. Just, wow.\nIn the end, the impression people are left with is that the MAX crashes \u2014 both\nof them \u2014 were more the result of operator error than a technical malfunction\nor defective design. The author may not have intended this; the piece is very\ncomplex and nuanced. But Boeing certainly loves the idea, and based on mail\nI\u2019ve received and comments I\u2019ve heard, for many that\u2019s the takeaway. This is\ncompounded by the title: \u201cWhat Really Brought Down the Boeing 737 Max.\u201d While\nprobably an editor\u2019s pick, it\u2019s misleading and inflammatory.\nWilliam is absolutely correct that the global pilot shortage is creating a\nhazard, in some cases putting woefully inexperienced crews at the helm of\nsophisticated jetliners. How and whether that plays into the MAX crashes,\nhowever, is maybe not as clear as he thinks. I also worry that the story will\nonly serve to encourage the prejudiced subset of pilots out there who believe\nthat non-Western pilots are categorically inferior. If only the two doomed\nplanes had been crewed by U.S. or European pilots, their thinking goes, rather\nthan pilots trained in Ethiopia or Indonesia, they wouldn\u2019t have crashed.\nMost of the author\u2019s analysis involves the Lion Air flight. A case can be made\nthat the crew of flight 610 turned a survivable situation into a non-\nsurvivable one through some poor decision making (specifically, by attempting\nto troubleshoot a control problem rather than immediately land). But it\u2019s just\nthat: a case. There were a lot of moving parts in that cockpit, both\nfiguratively and literally, and what seems the safer choice in a tidy\npostmortem analysis isn\u2019t always obvious in the heat of battle.\nAs to the pilots on Ethiopian flight 302, I\u2019m not sure anything could have\nsaved them. The issue that, to me, needs emphasis galore, is the aerodynamic\nlockout they purportedly faced\u2026\nThe investigation shows the Ethiopian pilots did, as they should have, engage\nthe plane\u2019s pitch trim disconnect switches in a frantic attempt to regain\ncontrol after a malfunctioning MCAS system forced the plane\u2019s nose toward the\nground. This pair of switches, on the center console near the thrust levers,\nkilled power to the entire automatic pitch trim system, including MCAS, and\nshould have allowed the pilots to maintain a normal flightpath using manual\ntrim and elevator. Manual trim is applied by turning a large wheel mounted to\nthe side of that same center console. Elevator is controlled by moving the\ncontrol column forward or aft.\nYet they did not, could not, regain control. The reason, many now believe, is\na design quirk of the 737 \u2014 an idiosyncrasy that reveals itself in only the\nrarest of circumstances. That is, when the plane\u2019s stabilizers are acting to\npush the nose down, and the control column is simultaneously pulled aft, a\nsort of aerodynamic lockout forms: airflow forces on the stabilizers\neffectively paralyze them, making them impossible to move manually.\nAboard flight 302, the scenario goes like this: Commands of the faulty MCAS\nare causing the automatic trim system to push the nose down. The pilots,\ntrying to arrest this descent, are pulling aft on the control column. The trim\nforces are stronger than the control column forces, which is why pulling back\non the column has no effect. But now, with power to the trim system shut off,\nthey should be able to lift the nose by manually by rotating the trim wheel\naft, relieving that unwanted nose-down push. But the wheel won\u2019t move.\nBelieving the manual trim is itself broken, the pilots then _reengage_ the\nauto-trim. MCAS then kicks in again, pushing the nose down even further.\nWhat\u2019s worse, as the plane\u2019s speed increases, the lockout effect intensifies.\nAnd so, with every passing second it becomes more and more difficult to\nrecover.\nThe correct course of action would be to _relax_ pressure on the control\ncolumn, perhaps to the point of pushing the nose down even further. This will\nfree the stabilizers of the aerodynamic weirdness paralyzing them, and allow\nthe trim wheel to move, realigning the stabilizers to a proper and safe\nposition. For the pilots, though, such a move would be completely\ncounterintuitive. Instead, they do what any pilots, with pretty much any\nbackground and any level of experience, would be expected to do under the\ncircumstances. Turns out it\u2019s the wrong and deadly thing, but they have no way\nof knowing.\nA friend and former colleague of mine \u2014 an experienced, American-trained pilot\nwho spent most of his career at U.S. carriers \u2014 worked for a time as a\ntraining captain at Ethiopian Airlines. He knew the captain of flight 302 and\nhas only the most positive things to say about his skills and professionalism.\nMaybe Langewiesche ought to have spoken to Seth. He at least could have spoken\nmore of the 302 crash, the dynamics of which, unfortunate as they were, remind\npeople that even the most talented and experienced pilots can find themselves\nin impossible situations. It would have rounded out the story and given it a\nmore even-handed feel.\nAdditionally, I wish he\u2019d more cleanly critiqued Boeing\u2019s decades-long\nobsession with its 737 platform, and its determination to keep the production\nline going, variant after variant, seemingly forever. Instead of starting from\nscratch with a new airframe, they took what was essentially conceived in the\n1960s as a regional jet, and have pushed and pushed and pushed the thing \u2014\nbigger and bigger engines, fancier avionics, MCAS \u2014 into roles it was never\nintended for. At the heart of this whole fiasco, maybe, is bad corporate\nstrategy and stubbornness.\n\n\nRelated Stories:\nTHE RIDDLE MAY NOT BE DEEP  \nETHIOPIAN, LION AIR, AND THE 737 MAX\nComments (72)\nSeptember 20, 2019 \u00b7 Filed under Uncategorized\nAN OP-ED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES BY PATRICK SMITH\nClick the Picture to Read\n![](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Golden-Age-.png)\n\n\nSome follow-up notes:\nThis is the sixth op-ed that I\u2019ve had published in the _Times_ , and I\u2019m\nextremely grateful for their interest. I\u2019m a little disappointed, though, at\nthe headline they chose for this one. It\u2019s misleading. The article isn\u2019t about\nflying in the old days; it\u2019s about flying _today_. I\u2019m making a case that the\ngolden age of air travel is in many ways happening _right now_ , not in some\nmythologized past.\nAs expected, the angry and sarcastic letters have been pouring in. A lot of\nthem are flip and fail to acknowledge the points I\u2019m making. Here\u2019s a typical\nexample, sent anonymously\u2026\n![](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Feedback.png)\nWe need to look at this objectively. Is flying cheaper than it used to be, yes\nor no? Is it safer, yes or no? Is it faster and, in a surprising number of\nways, more comfortable and convenient? Either it is, or it isn\u2019t. And the\nanswer, in each case, is yes. That\u2019s not me talking; it\u2019s simply the facts.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean flying is a wonderful experience. And, if you\u2019re at all\nfamiliar with my writing over the years, you\u2019ll know that I have amply\ncriticized the airlines when that criticism has been due. Poor communications,\nterrible customer service, lousy onboard products, our miserable airports \u2014\nI\u2019ve covered that stuff countless times without pulling my punches.\nDuly Noted\nWhat I\u2019m doing in the Times piece, though, is pointing out a few of the _good_\nthings that are seldom acknowledged.\nNo matter, a number of readers already have insisted that not only am I wrong,\nand that flying is truly awful, but in fact it\u2019s _never been worse._ To which\nI ask: really, are you _sure?_ And if so, let\u2019s try this: Imagine that you\u2019re\nplanning an economy class trip from, I don\u2019t know, Seattle to Paris. You have\ntwo theoretical options. Option number one is that you can fly the route\ntomorrow, on the carrier of your choice, and experience flying exactly as it\nis. Or, option two, you can travel back in time and do it in 1965. What\u2019s your\npick? Just keep in mind that if you choose the latter, you\u2019ll get a couple of\nextra inches of legroom, shorter lines at the airport, and maybe a chirpier\nflight attendant. Your journey also will take several hours longer, cost more\nthan twice as much, and you will sit in a cabin with no personal entertainment\nsystem, filled with people smoking. And, just for good measure, your chances\nof being in an accident will be about eight times higher.\nAre you still down for it?\nFor what it\u2019s worth, a colleague and I were talking the other day, and we both\nagreed that so much of what people hate about flying isn\u2019t really airline-\nrelated, per se, but rather infrastructural. The decrepit state of our\nairports, for example, and our outdated air traffic control system, contribute\nsignificantly to delays and congestion. Then you\u2019ve got TSA. Our security\ncheckpoints are badly overcrowded and poorly designed. Customs and immigration\nprocedures, too, are flyer-unfriendly. These are bureaucratic and government-\nfunding issues more than anything else. Fix them, and I estimate that 75\npercent of passengers\u2019 frustrations would disappear.\nIn the meantime, how trendy has it become to bash the airlines? The _New York\nPost_ even has a \u201cHell of Flying\u201d section\u2026\n![](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hell-of-Flying.jpg)\nComments (82)\nMay 28, 2017 \u00b7 Filed under Uncategorized\n### Conspiracy Theories, Transponders, Rogue Pilots and Media Madness.\n\n#### UPDATE: August 2, 2016\n\nSO THIS is what it comes down to. Earlier this week, the multi-nation team\ninvestigating the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 announced\nthat the hunt for the missing Boeing 777, which had been concentrated in the\nsoutheastern Indian Ocean, was at last being called off. After two years and\nover a hundred million search dollars, only a few scattered pieces of the\njetliner were found, washed ashore on isolated islands, presumably hundreds or\neven thousands of miles from the actual, unknown spot were the flight met its\nend.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised. I\u2019ve been saying from the start that we\nshould prepare for the possibility of the disaster remaining forever unsolved.\nIt happens this way sometimes. If it helps you feel better, the air crash\nannals contain numerous unsolved accidents. What makes this one different,\nmaybe, is that major air crashes are so rare to begin with nowadays. On top of\nthat, we\u2019ve come to expect and demand easy and fast solutions to pretty much\neverything, with a fetishized belief that \u201ctechnology,\u201d whatever that even\nmeans anymore, can answer any question and fix any problem.\n\nBut it can\u2019t. Sometimes nature wins. And that\u2019s what this is about,\nultimately: nature. The immensity of the ocean, both in breadth and depth,\nversus the comparative speck of a 777. Oh sure, radios, transponders,\nemergency locator transmitters, GPS, real-time position streaming, satellite\ntracking. All of that is fallible, one way or the other. The wreckage is out\nthere somewhere, nestled invisibly in some immense undersea fissure or canyon,\nin the ink-black darkness beneath thousands of feet of seawater. The search\nvessels may have swept right over it.\n\nThere are two possibilities, just as there always have been. One nefarious,\nthe other accidental. There\u2019s a new report out claiming that a computer\nbelonging to flight 370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a home simulator\nenthusiast, contained a simulated flight routing, deep into the Indian Ocean,\neerily similar to the route believed to have been flown by MH370 after contact\nwas lost. You can see the two routings, side-by-side, in this graphic.\nZaharie\u2019s possible \u201cdry run\u201d is the red one.\n\n![\\(Courtesy of Jeff Wise\\)](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Jeff-Wise-MH370.png)\n\n(Courtesy of Jeff Wise)\n\nThe similarities are startling \u2014 particularly the segment that backtracks\nnorthwesterly through the Straits of Malacca. Still, it\u2019s hard to say how much\nof a smoking gun this is, because it\u2019s one of many routings that Zaharie had\nsimulated. The latitude and longitude waypoints comprising the route had been\ndeleted from the software and were recovered by computer forensics experts.\nWas this done correctly? Are the waypoints accurate? Were they cherry picked\namong numerous others? What did the other simulations look like, and how many\nwere there?\n\nWithout more information, we can\u2019t discount scenarios involving mechanical\nmalfunction. One of the most compelling of these is the possibility of a\nmishandled cabin depressurization. High-altitude decompressions can be rapid\nor gradual, but either way it\u2019s critical that the pilots get their\nsupplemental oxygen masks on immediately. We imagine a situation where they\ndid not, becoming disoriented as they attempted to troubleshoot and organize a\ndiversion back to Kuala Lumpur or some other airport, getting only a partial \u2014\nor garbled \u2014 re-route into the plane\u2019s navigation system before falling\nunconscious. Eventually the plane passed the last programmed waypoint, then\ndefaulted to heading mode and wandered off into the southern Indian Ocean\nuntil running out of fuel. (Among the proponents of this theory is Christine\nNegroni, who details such a scenario in her upcoming book, The Crash\nDetectives.)\n\nOr perhaps they had no supplemental oxygen. On the 777-200, the supply bottle\nfor the pilots is located in a space below and just aft of the cockpit, close\nto the main avionics bay, through which much of the plane\u2019s communications\nequipment is routed. Some have speculated that the oxygen bottle could have\nexploded, knocking out nearby equipment, including transponder and ACARS (this\nwould explain the loss communications data just as the flight was crossing\ninto Vietnamese airspace) and, more critically, causing a decompression. The\npilots would have put their masks on, but with only residual oxygen left in\nthe lines, or perhaps none at all, they would quickly have succumbed to\nhypoxia. There have been serious incidents with oxygen bottles before,\nincluding ones on a Qantas 747.\n\nThese are plausible theories, yet they haven\u2019t gotten much traction \u2014 possibly\n_because_ they\u2019re plausible, unlike some of the more sensational ideas being\npassed around.\n\nThose ideas will never go away. And barring a small miracle, we\u2019ll never learn\nfor certain what happened.\n\n#### UPDATE: June 26, 2014\n\nWHO VETS THESE THINGS? In today\u2019s New York Times, it says, \u201cAngus Houston, the\nretired head of the Australian military who is overseeing the country\u2019s\nsearch, said in an interview earlier this month that he assumed the flight\nwould have been on autopilot even if a conscious pilot had been at the\ncontrols. That is because _a Boeing 777 is a very difficult plane to fly\nmanually_.\u201d\n\nThose italics are mine. They are mine because the statement is absurd. If\nanything a 777 is an _easy_ plane to fly manually.\n\nSure, the autopilot would have been engaged even with a conscious pilot at the\ncontrols. Virtually _all_ commercial aircraft have their autopilots engaged\nduring the cruise portion of flight. It has been this way since the 1940s. It\nhas nothing to do with the planes being difficult to fly. It\u2019s because hand-\nflying a jet for several hours, on a more or less straight course across the\nocean, would be incredibly tedious. Easy, but numbing and exhausting.\n\nThis is another example of the media relying on outside specialists (military\nsources, aeronautics professors, researchers and bureaucrats) to comment on\ncommercial airline operations \u2014 something they often know very little about.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest reports are saying that hypoxia \u2014 that is, the crew\nfalling unconscious due to lack of oxygen \u2014 appears to be the \u201cbest fit\u201d for\nthe MH 370 mystery. How this may have happened, if it did, remains unknown,\nbut possibilities include a cabin breach caused by a bomb or structural\nfailure, or a major pressurization malfunction. Pilots are trained to deal\nwith such things, and even a total loss of cabin pressure is seldom dangerous.\nBut, they have to respond quickly and appropriately.\n\nThe hypoxia idea has been there from the beginning (I\u2019m one of several people\nwho\u2019ve been citing it as a possibility, right from day one), but has been lost\namidst the more colorful theories of pilot suicide, hijacking, UFO abduction,\nand so forth.\n\nWith its occupants unconscious, the jet would have continued on its last\nprogrammed routing until running out of fuel and crashing. And no, to answer a\nquestion several readers have put forth, the jet would not have been guided\nvia autopilot to a smooth touchdown on the ocean surface.\n\nOnce the engines quit, the plane would have stayed stable for a certain amount\nof time, then eventually would have stalled and/or plummeted and crashed. How\nmuch time? It\u2019d somewhat depend on which modes of the autopilot had been\nengaged, as well as the plane\u2019s altitude and speed. If the engines failed\nsimultaneously (unlikely) the plane would stay aloft somewhat longer. If one\nengine failed before the other (much more likely), the resulting asymmetrical\nforces, without a pilot on hand to react, would have been quickly\ncatastrophic. See the Helios Airways accident in 2005, for an example.\n\n#### UPDATE: May 7, 2014\n\nJUST A FEW THOUGHTS on Matt Wald\u2019s _New York Times_ story, titled \u201cU.N. to\nConsider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, planes _are_ tracked over the ocean, even in remote, non-radar\nareas. This is something the media hasn\u2019t been good at explaining.\n\nIt\u2019s a semantic discussion to some degree (what does \u201ctracking\u201d mean?), but\nheadlines the likes of \u201cU.N. to Consider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas,\u201d and\nsimilar phrasings, which have been rampant, give people the impression that\nonce a plane hits oceanic airspace, it effectively disappears until making\nlandfall on the other side. This is _not_ the case, at all.\n\nCrews are _always_ in touch with both air traffic control _and_ company\npersonnel on the ground, and both of these entities are following and tracking\nyou. Tranponders aren\u2019t used in non-radar areas, but you\u2019ve also got HF radio,\nSATCOM, CPDLC, FMC datalink and so forth. Which equipment you\u2019re using to\ncommunicate depends where you are and which air traffic control facility\nyou\u2019re working with.\n\nWhat happened in the case of flight 370, of course, is that all of this\nequipment stopped working \u2014 it was either switched off intentionally, or\nfailed. The plane wasn\u2019t being tracked because the communications equipment\nwas dead. We can and perhaps should argue whether some sort of fail-safe,\nindependently powered locator signal ought to be installed aboard transoceanic\naircraft, able to transmit latitude and longitude position, but in normal\noperations the existing equipment works quite well, and is a lot more\nsophisticated than people are being led to believe.\n\nThe _Times_ story also segued into an annoying and misleading discussion about\n\u2014 here we go again \u2014 why it is that pilots are able to turn a transponder\n_off_. The comments of retired pilot Robert Hilb were especially frustrating.\nTo cut and paste from a prior post (which you can read further down this\npage)\u2026\n\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for _three reasons_ :\n\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\n\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are not monitored by\nradar, and transponders are not used for tracking. We keep the units turned on\nbecause the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story only when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 26, 2014\n\nIT\u2019S AMAZING how this story has fallen off the table. The big TV networks\n(this means you CNN) finally faced up to the fact they couldn\u2019t keep leading,\nhour after hour, with a story that wasn\u2019t changing. The jet was missing, and\nit kept on being missing, and here we are in the middle of April and it\u2019s\n_still_ missing.\n\nCount me among those who feel that this is how it ends: a mystery. The plane\nis out there somewhere, at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, and in all\nlikelihood we\u2019re not going to find it. Even if the wreckage can be pinpointed,\ndredging up the black boxes from 15,000 feet of seawater would itself be a\nmonumental task. And even with the recorders salvaged we might not learn what\nhappened.\n\nMy hunch is that a malfunction, rather than foul play, brought the plane down.\nA poorly handled decompression, for example, caused by a structural problem or\nwindscreen failure. Or a catastrophic electrical failure combined with smoke,\nfire or fumes that rendered the crew unconscious. Granted that doesn\u2019t totally\njibe with the evidence, but _none_ of the theories do. Not ruling anything\nout, including the possibility of a pilot suicide mission. I\u2019m somewhat\nmystified that more hasn\u2019t been made of the captain\u2019s domestic situation \u2014 his\nfailing marriage and, according to some, unusual behavior \u2014 in the days\nleading up to the plane\u2019s disappearance.\n\nThis is how it goes sometimes. The archives of aviation accidents, rare as\nthey might be, contain numerous unsolved disasters \u2014 including aircraft that\nhave never been found or recovered. The fate of Malaysia 370, it looks like,\nwill be added to the list.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 4, 2014\n\nTHE MEDIA really needs a chill pill. And for the love of heaven, would people\n_please_ stop talking about transponders. National Public Radio host Robert\nSiegel was on the air yesterday, the latest in a know-nothing chorus\ncomplaining about the ability of pilots to turn transponders off, clearly\npossessing little or no idea how the devices actually work.\n\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for three reasons:\n\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in.

And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\n\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are _not_ monitored by\nradar, and transponders are _not_ used for tracking. We keep the units turned\non because the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story _only_ when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, _it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway_.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 3, 2014\n\nACCORDING TO Reason.org, a new Reason-Rupe poll finds 35 percent of Americans\nthink a mechanical problem caused Malaysia Airlines flight 370 to crash; 22\npercent believe the pilots crashed the plane intentionally; 12 percent feel it\nwas destroyed by terrorists; 9 percent say the plane landed safely and is in\nhiding; 5 percent believe the disappearance is related to supernatural or\nalien activity; and 3 percent think it was shot down by a foreign government.\n\nThat\u2019s slightly more encouraging than I expected, with some 57 percent of\npeople overall hewing to what have been, from the start, the two most credible\navenues of possibility: mechanical problem or rogue crew hijacking.\n\n#### UPDATE: March 30, 2014\n\nI\u2019VE READ AND HEARD some pretty asinine characterizations of airline pilots\nbefore, but rarely have I come across anything as absurd, inaccurate, or\nirresponsible as what was printed on the front page of the March 28-30 weekend\ninternational edition of USA Today.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the story by Mahi Ramakrishnan headlined, \u201cFlight Change\nBlamed on Pilot.\u201d (A slightly different version of this story ran in the March\n27th U.S. edition.)\n\n\u201cThe pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is believed to be solely\nresponsible for steering the flight hundreds of miles off course\u2026\u201d begins the\nstory. Right away I feel an ulcer coming on.\n\nI find it almost inconceivable that after decades of covering commercial\naviation, USA Today would fail to understand there is always a minimum of\n_two_ pilots in the cockpit: a captain and a first officer. The latter is\nknown colloquially as the copilot, but they _both_ are fully qualified pilots.\nThey _both_ perform takeoffs and landings, and _both_ are certified to operate\nthe aircraft in all regimes of flight. A first officer is not an apprentice.\nIn fact, owing to the quirks of the airline seniority system, it is not\nunheard of for the first officer to be older and more experienced than the\ncaptain. More here.\n\nHow many times have I been through this? I\u2019ve explained it repeatedly in blog\npostings, articles, and in my book. I have no idea how many people have been\nlistening, but in one fell swoop USA Today has misinformed hundreds of\nthousands of readers.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse\u2026\n\nLater in the same story we are told that one of the Malaysian investigators\nsaid of the crew, \u201cOnly the captain possessed the experience and expertise to\nfly the plane.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what disturbs me more: that an accident investigator would say\nsuch a nonsensical and untrue thing, or that USA Today didn\u2019t have the common\nsense to vet it. I can\u2019t believe that nobody on the editorial staff of a paper\nthat runs so many airlines stories, and that caters to travelers, didn\u2019t at\nleast flag this statement for review.\n\nThe idea that a first officer on a Boeing 777 wouldn\u2019t have the experience or\nexpertise to operate the aircraft on his own is beyond preposterous. Why the\ninvestigator would assert otherwise, if in fact the quote was interpreted\ncorrectly, I have no idea.\n\nThe details of the Malaysia Airlines mystery have been subject to enough\nmisinterpretation and general media overboiling as it is. This puts things\nover the top, into the realm of total and complete nonsense.\n\nAnd hang on, there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nThe same issue of USA Today, on page 10A, features a letter to the editor by a\nman from Minnesota named Tom O\u2019Mara. His topic is the tracking of commercial\nflights. He asks that we \u201cdemand that airlines track all their flights from\ntakeoff to landing.\u201d Five dollars per passenger, he submits, ought to be\ninvested in a \u201ctracking system for commercial flights over the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe problem here is that commercial flights are tracked over the oceans. Air\ncrews must always be in contact with both air traffic control and company\ndispatchers on the ground. Most intercontinental aircraft have datalink or\nsatellite communications systems that allow for constant real-time tracking.\n\nOf course, this equipment works only so long as it\u2019s powered. A fire, failure,\nor act of sabotage can render it inoperative \u2014 no different, I would presume,\nfrom any piece of equipment in any application in any industry. Maybe that\u2019s\nO\u2019Mara\u2019s point; possibly he\u2019s arguing for some type of fail-safe tracking\nmechanism that can\u2019t be destroyed or turned off? But he doesn\u2019t say so, and\nthe tone and implication of his letter is simple and clear enough: planes are\nnot tracked.\n\nWhich is untrue. And here the newspaper again drops the ball, by publishing a\nletter based on a false premise.\n\n#### UPDATE: March 27, 2014\n\nTHE GRAPHICS ON CNN say \u201cBreaking News\u2026\u201d followed by, \u201cThere is no new\ninformation in the disappearance of flight MH370.\u201d Can\u2019t make this up.\n\nMalaysian authorities, meanwhile, have put out the blockbuster announcement\nthat they are confident the plane crashed into the sea. Damn, and all this\ntime I believed the jet was hidden away in a hangar somewhere on a \u201cremote\nairstrip.\u201d\n\nExcept of course that plenty of people really do subscribe to such an idea.\nAnd it\u2019s this conspiracy mongering that\u2019s the most discouraging and\ndistracting aspect of this entire story. How it got there we don\u2019t yet know \u2014\nand we may never know \u2014 but there is an extremely high certainty that the\nplane is in the Indian ocean. This is by far the likeliest possibility, and I\nwish the TV networks would cease and desist from giving further credence to\nnotions of a kidnapping conspiracy. There is zero evidence to support such a\nclaim, and analytically it makes no sense. Some buffoon was on Fox News the\nother night saying, \u201cThis has all the makings of a hostage situation.\u201d\nActually, it has _none_ of the makings of a hostage situation.\n\nNot that I\u2019m shocked that so many people are willing to accept these ideas.\nWhat is it about our society nowadays that foments such fanciful and illogical\nlines of thinking?\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a bullet-point look at some of the topics and theories we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from the start:\n\n**TRANSPONDERS** The media has been throwing this term around without a full\nunderstanding of how the equipment works. See my explanation at the top of\nthis post.\n\n**\u201cALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT\u201d** If I hear one more person attempt to make\nsomething of the first officer\u2019s final words to air traffic control \u2014 \u201call\nright, good night\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to hit the roof. There is _nothing_ unusual\nabout this salutation. While it sounds cryptic in the context of the ongoing\nmystery, it\u2019s a perfectly normal sign-off \u2014 the kind of thing pilots say to\ncontrollers _all the time_.\n\n**THE RADAR RUSE** I\u2019m talking about this post, by an aviation enthusiast\nnamed Keith Ledgerwood. His hypothesis is that the missing Malaysia Airlines\njet had tucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019\nradar signatures to appear as one. Thus disguised, the Malaysia jet flew on,\nundetected for hours before eventually breaking off and landing at an airfield\nin\u2026? See that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about this idea. It fails to offer any\nexplanation as to how, once separating from the Singapore flight, the Malaysia\njet could have completed its secret diversion without being seen \u2014 to say\nnothing of _why_ such a difficult and elaborate plot would be put in motion to\nbegin with. It makes very little sense, other than it allows an aviation\nhobbyist to show off a little, and provides more fodder for a media starved of\nuseful information. Beyond that, if the Malaysia plane had been directly below\nthe Singapore 777, the latter\u2019s radar altimeter would have shown it. The radar\naltimeter is a device that displays physical distance, in feet, to an object\nbelow. (They differ from a plane\u2019s main altimeters, which reference height\nabove sea level.) In normal operations that object is the ground, but during\ncruise they commonly pick up crossing traffic, momentarily showing planes as\nthey pass beneath. So, ask the Singapore crew: was your radar altimeter\nflashing on and off, showing some sort of object below you?\n\n**FIRE OR FUMES?** This theory has gotten a ton of attention thanks to a Wired\nmagazine story penned by a general aviation pilot named Chris Goodfellow. He\nproposes that the flight\u2019s sudden turn off course was a response to an\ninflight emergency \u2014 an intentional deviation forced by an electrical or cargo\nfire. While headed for an emergency landing, the crew was overcome by smoke or\nfumes. Its autopilot on and course reprogrammed, the plane then continued on\nfor a time before crashing. The theory is described in the headline as\n\u201cstartlingly simple,\u201d though in fact there\u2019s nothing startling about it, and\nGoodfellow more or less repeats what _I_ said in a post back on March 14th.\nThat a fire would be potent enough knock out communications and incapacitate\nthe crew, yet not destroy the aircraft very quickly, is certainly a sticking\npoint, but neither is it impossible.\n\n**THE TERRORIST PLOT** If indeed this was a hijacking, did the plane land\nsomewhere, as some are suggesting, possibly to be used later as an airborne\nweapon of some kind, perhaps loaded with a nuclear or biological weapon? I\n_seriously_ doubt it. Remote as some airports are, the task of stealing and\nthen secretly landing and hiding a 777 would be exceptionally difficult. But\nmore than that, what sense would it make for a terrorist group steal a\ncommercial jetliner full of passengers from one of the most prestigious\nairlines in the world, guaranteeing that everybody on the planet will be\nlooking for it? There are hundreds or even thousand of cargo planes and\nbusiness jets that move around the world each day more or less anonymously,\nany one of which would do the job equally as well as well, with only a small\nfraction of the attention. That\u2019s not to discount the possibility of a\nhijacking outright, but I can\u2019t imagine the plane actually landed somewhere.\nAs to other motives, remember that the long, long history of air piracy did\nnot begin and end with September 11th, 2001, so it\u2019s important not to view\nevery hijacking through the crucible of the 9/11 template. People hijack\nplanes for different reason. It may even have been a rogue crewmember.\n\n**REMOTE CONTROL** This one is full-on James Bond. We\u2019re told how the plane\u2019s\n\u201cflight computer,\u201d whatever that is, was hacked, allowing the plane to be\nflown remotely, like a drone, either to crash it into the ocean or carry it to\na secret airstrip somewhere. I\u2019m frustrated by how often this is suggested,\nbecause there is simply no way to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane. People seem to have a vastly exaggerated idea of how modern\njetliners are flown \u2014 that is, they vastly exaggerate the capabilities of\ncockpit automation, and what a person with access to this automation, whether\nfrom inside or outside the plane, would be able to do with it. People read and\nhear things out of context \u2014 simplified explanations and experimental\napplications of technology \u2014 and they extrapolate unrealistically. And it\u2019s\nnot as if the pilots don\u2019t monitor and crosscheck a plane\u2019s progress when its\nautoflight system is engaged. We are constantly doing that. If something were\nmessing with one or more of the system\u2019s modes, we\u2019d know it, and could easily\ndisengage that mode and fly using basic course, altitude, or power commands.\nWorst-case, we can switch the automation off completely and do everything by\nhand.\n\n**WHY NO PHONE CALLS?** Some have wondered why, assuming the jet was hijacked,\npassengers did not place cell phone calls to loved ones, as occurred during\nthe 9/11 attacks. Does the absence of call records suggest the passengers had\nbeen incapacitated somehow, or that the plane had met a sudden end? No. Unless\nan aircraft is flying low and within range of a cell tower, cellular calling\nfrom a plane _does not work_. Your phone _will not_ maintain a signal. Some\nairplanes are equipped with special technology that permits calling via\nsatellite or using radio frequencies to transmit cellular calls, but I\u2019m\nuncertain if Malaysia\u2019s 777s have this technology. Even if they do it could\nhave been intentionally turned off or suffered a power failure, no different\nfrom the plane\u2019s other communications equipment.\n\n**THE MISSING MAYDAY** Lack of a mayday call: No matter an aircraft\u2019s\nlocation, the crew is _always_ in contact with both air traffic control and\ncompany ground staff. When flying in remote locations, however, this is often\na more involved process than simply picking up a microphone and talking.\nExactly how it\u2019s done depends on which equipment the plane is fitted with, and\nwhich ATC facility you\u2019re working with. Flying over open ocean, relaying even\na simple message can be a multi-step process transmitted through FMS datalink\nor over high frequency radio. In an emergency, communicating with the ground\nis secondary to dealing with the problems at hand. As the old adage goes: you\naviate, navigate, and communicate \u2014 in that order. And so, the fact that no\nmessages or distress signals were sent by the crew is _not_ surprising or an\nindicator of anything specific.\n\n**INTO ORBIT** Of the wackier ideas I\u2019ve been hearing, my favorite is the one\nthat goes like this: Would it be possible for the 777 to have climbed clear\nout of the atmosphere, so high that \u201cit disintegrated,\u201d went into orbit, or\notherwise became impossible to track or locate? In normal circumstances I\nwouldn\u2019t burden the rest of you with an answer to such nonsense, except that\nno fewer than _five_ readers already have asked some version of this question.\nThe answer is no. It is totally impossible for that to happen. At a certain\naltitude, a plane\u2019s engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings\nwill no longer provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to\nsustain flight. All commercial passenger jets have maximum certified cruising\naltitudes below 50,000 feet or so. And even this altitude isn\u2019t always\nreachable. The maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight,\nthe air temperature and other factors.\n\n**HYPOXIA** Could a rapid loss of cabin pressure, perhaps as a result of a\nfire or some other problem, rendered the flight crew, and possibly everyone\nelse on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane continued\non before eventually crashing. This is conceivable, yes (though maybe no more\nso than assorted other scenarios). Depressurizations by themselves are\nperfectly manageable and almost never fatal (see chapter two of my book for a\nstory about the time it happened to me), and something that all airline crews\ntrain for, but only _if_ the crew understands the problem and does what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do. See Helios Airways.\n\n**THE STOLEN PASSPORTS** Interpol says the Iranians with stolen passports were\nmigrants hoping to be smuggled into Europe. There are thousands of people\njetting around the world on forged or stolen documents, for a variety of shady\nreasons, but that doesn\u2019t make them terrorist bombers.\n\n**PILOT EXPERIENCE** It\u2019s doubtful this was any factor. The captain of the\nill-fated flight had logged close to 20,000 flight hours, a substantial total\nby any standard. The first officer (copilot), on the other hand, had fewer\nthan three thousand hours to his name. Pilots in North America \u2014 those like\nme, at any rate, who come up through the civilian ranks \u2014 generally accrue\nseveral thousand hours before landing a job with a major airline. We slog our\nway through the industry in a step-by-step process, building experience along\nthe way. Thus it would be unheard of to find a Boeing 777 copilot with such a\nsmall number of hours. In other areas of the world, the process is often\ndifferent. Pilots are frequently selected through so-called ab-initio\nprograms, hand-picked by carriers at a young age and trained from the start to\nfly jetliners. We can debate the perils of this method, but I tend to doubt\nit\u2019s anything more than a side note. Plus, flight hours in and of themselves\naren\u2019t necessarily a good measure of a pilot\u2019s skills or performance under\npressure. And any pilot, regardless of his or her logbook totals, and\nregardless of the airline, needs to meet some pretty rigorous training\nstandards before being signed off to fly a 777.\n\nAll we know for sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or\ncommunication from the crew. The culprit could be anything from sabotage to\nfire to a bizarre mechanical problem \u2014 or, as is so common in airline\ncatastrophes, some combination or compounding of human error and/or mechanical\nmalfunction.\n\nAnd all the while people keep asking \u201chow can a plane simply disappear?\u201d It\u2019s\nan idea that to many makes no sense in an age of instant and total\nconnectivity. But consider: if somebody yanks the power cord out of your\ncomputer, suddenly all the wonderful immediacy and connectivity of the\ninternet is effectively vanished. Similarly, all of the fancy equipment in a\n777\u2019s cockpit is only useful if it\u2019s actually _running_. Thus, together with\nan absence of primary radar over much of the ocean, the idea that a plane can\ndisappear becomes a lot more conceivable.\n\nAnd no matter who or what is to blame, we shouldn\u2019t let this latest tragedy\novershadow the fact that air travel remains remarkably safe. Worldwide, the\ntrend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement, to the\npoint where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial\naviation. Hopefully their number continues to diminish, but a certain number\nof accidents will always be inevitable. In some ways, the weirdness of this\nstory speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most\ncommon causes of crashes. Those that still occur tend to be more mysterious\nand strange than in decades past (have a look at the year 1985 some time, for\nan idea of how frequent large-scale air disasters once were).\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a\npresumed airplane crash to, really, a _mystery story_. It\u2019s the very missing-\nness of the plane that the public finds so captivating. If and when the\nwreckage is discovered, I have to wonder if suddenly people will stop paying\nsuch rapt attention. If so, that\u2019s too bad, because the question at hand ought\nto be what happened on board the jet, not _where is_ the jet.\n\nI say \u201cif and when\u201d because I think people need to reconcile with the\npossibility that the plane might _never_ be found. I know that sounds absurd\nin an age where fast and easy answers are taken for granted, but it could very\nwell happen.\n\n__________\n\nMalaysia Airlines was formed in the early 1970s after its predecessor,\nMalaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA), split to become Singapore Airlines and\nMalaysia Airlines. Both carriers are renowned for their outstanding passenger\nservice, and both have excellent safety records. Cabin crews of both airlines\nwear the iconic, floral pattern \u201cSarong Kabaya\u201d batik \u2014 a adaptation of the\ntraditional Malay kebaya blouse.\n\nMalaysia Airlines\u2019 logo, carried on its tails from the beginning, is an\nindigenous kite known as the Wau. True story: In 1993 I was in the city of\nKota Bahru, a conservative Islamic town in northern Malaysia close to the Thai\nborder, when we saw a group of little kids flying Wau kites. At the time I\ndidn\u2019t realize where the airline\u2019s logo had come from, but I recognized the\npattern immediately. It was one of those airline/culture crossover moments\nthat we aerophiles really savor.\n\n![Malaysia Airlines logo](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/03/Malaysia-Airlines-logo.jpg)\n\nRelated Story:  \nDATELINE BORNEO:MALAYSIA AIRLINES AND A TRIP TO THE EAST\nSO THIS is what it comes down to. Earlier this week, the multi-nation team\ninvestigating the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 announced\nthat the hunt for the missing Boeing 777, which had been concentrated in the\nsoutheastern Indian Ocean, was at last being called off. After two years and\nover a hundred million search dollars, only a few scattered pieces of the\njetliner were found, washed ashore on isolated islands, presumably hundreds or\neven thousands of miles from the actual, unknown spot were the flight met its\nend.\nI\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised. I\u2019ve been saying from the start that we\nshould prepare for the possibility of the disaster remaining forever unsolved.\nIt happens this way sometimes. If it helps you feel better, the air crash\nannals contain numerous unsolved accidents. What makes this one different,\nmaybe, is that major air crashes are so rare to begin with nowadays. On top of\nthat, we\u2019ve come to expect and demand easy and fast solutions to pretty much\neverything, with a fetishized belief that \u201ctechnology,\u201d whatever that even\nmeans anymore, can answer any question and fix any problem.\nBut it can\u2019t. Sometimes nature wins. And that\u2019s what this is about,\nultimately: nature. The immensity of the ocean, both in breadth and depth,\nversus the comparative speck of a 777. Oh sure, radios, transponders,\nemergency locator transmitters, GPS, real-time position streaming, satellite\ntracking. All of that is fallible, one way or the other. The wreckage is out\nthere somewhere, nestled invisibly in some immense undersea fissure or canyon,\nin the ink-black darkness beneath thousands of feet of seawater. The search\nvessels may have swept right over it.\nThere are two possibilities, just as there always have been. One nefarious,\nthe other accidental. There\u2019s a new report out claiming that a computer\nbelonging to flight 370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a home simulator\nenthusiast, contained a simulated flight routing, deep into the Indian Ocean,\neerily similar to the route believed to have been flown by MH370 after contact\nwas lost. You can see the two routings, side-by-side, in this graphic.\nZaharie\u2019s possible \u201cdry run\u201d is the red one.\n(Courtesy of Jeff Wise)\nThe similarities are startling \u2014 particularly the segment that backtracks\nnorthwesterly through the Straits of Malacca. Still, it\u2019s hard to say how much\nof a smoking gun this is, because it\u2019s one of many routings that Zaharie had\nsimulated. The latitude and longitude waypoints comprising the route had been\ndeleted from the software and were recovered by computer forensics experts.\nWas this done correctly? Are the waypoints accurate? Were they cherry picked\namong numerous others? What did the other simulations look like, and how many\nwere there?\nWithout more information, we can\u2019t discount scenarios involving mechanical\nmalfunction. One of the most compelling of these is the possibility of a\nmishandled cabin depressurization. High-altitude decompressions can be rapid\nor gradual, but either way it\u2019s critical that the pilots get their\nsupplemental oxygen masks on immediately. We imagine a situation where they\ndid not, becoming disoriented as they attempted to troubleshoot and organize a\ndiversion back to Kuala Lumpur or some other airport, getting only a partial \u2014\nor garbled \u2014 re-route into the plane\u2019s navigation system before falling\nunconscious. Eventually the plane passed the last programmed waypoint, then\ndefaulted to heading mode and wandered off into the southern Indian Ocean\nuntil running out of fuel. (Among the proponents of this theory is Christine\nNegroni, who details such a scenario in her upcoming book, The Crash\nDetectives.)\nOr perhaps they had no supplemental oxygen. On the 777-200, the supply bottle\nfor the pilots is located in a space below and just aft of the cockpit, close\nto the main avionics bay, through which much of the plane\u2019s communications\nequipment is routed. Some have speculated that the oxygen bottle could have\nexploded, knocking out nearby equipment, including transponder and ACARS (this\nwould explain the loss communications data just as the flight was crossing\ninto Vietnamese airspace) and, more critically, causing a decompression. The\npilots would have put their masks on, but with only residual oxygen left in\nthe lines, or perhaps none at all, they would quickly have succumbed to\nhypoxia. There have been serious incidents with oxygen bottles before,\nincluding ones on a Qantas 747.\nThese are plausible theories, yet they haven\u2019t gotten much traction \u2014 possibly\n_because_ they\u2019re plausible, unlike some of the more sensational ideas being\npassed around.\nThose ideas will never go away. And barring a small miracle, we\u2019ll never learn\nfor certain what happened.\n\n\nWHO VETS THESE THINGS? In today\u2019s New York Times, it says, \u201cAngus Houston, the\nretired head of the Australian military who is overseeing the country\u2019s\nsearch, said in an interview earlier this month that he assumed the flight\nwould have been on autopilot even if a conscious pilot had been at the\ncontrols. That is because _a Boeing 777 is a very difficult plane to fly\nmanually_.\u201d\nThose italics are mine. They are mine because the statement is absurd. If\nanything a 777 is an _easy_ plane to fly manually.\nSure, the autopilot would have been engaged even with a conscious pilot at the\ncontrols. Virtually _all_ commercial aircraft have their autopilots engaged\nduring the cruise portion of flight. It has been this way since the 1940s. It\nhas nothing to do with the planes being difficult to fly. It\u2019s because hand-\nflying a jet for several hours, on a more or less straight course across the\nocean, would be incredibly tedious. Easy, but numbing and exhausting.\nThis is another example of the media relying on outside specialists (military\nsources, aeronautics professors, researchers and bureaucrats) to comment on\ncommercial airline operations \u2014 something they often know very little about.\nMeanwhile, the latest reports are saying that hypoxia \u2014 that is, the crew\nfalling unconscious due to lack of oxygen \u2014 appears to be the \u201cbest fit\u201d for\nthe MH 370 mystery. How this may have happened, if it did, remains unknown,\nbut possibilities include a cabin breach caused by a bomb or structural\nfailure, or a major pressurization malfunction. Pilots are trained to deal\nwith such things, and even a total loss of cabin pressure is seldom dangerous.\nBut, they have to respond quickly and appropriately.\nThe hypoxia idea has been there from the beginning (I\u2019m one of several people\nwho\u2019ve been citing it as a possibility, right from day one), but has been lost\namidst the more colorful theories of pilot suicide, hijacking, UFO abduction,\nand so forth.\nWith its occupants unconscious, the jet would have continued on its last\nprogrammed routing until running out of fuel and crashing. And no, to answer a\nquestion several readers have put forth, the jet would not have been guided\nvia autopilot to a smooth touchdown on the ocean surface.\nOnce the engines quit, the plane would have stayed stable for a certain amount\nof time, then eventually would have stalled and/or plummeted and crashed. How\nmuch time? It\u2019d somewhat depend on which modes of the autopilot had been\nengaged, as well as the plane\u2019s altitude and speed. If the engines failed\nsimultaneously (unlikely) the plane would stay aloft somewhat longer. If one\nengine failed before the other (much more likely), the resulting asymmetrical\nforces, without a pilot on hand to react, would have been quickly\ncatastrophic. See the Helios Airways accident in 2005, for an example.\n\n\nJUST A FEW THOUGHTS on Matt Wald\u2019s _New York Times_ story, titled \u201cU.N. to\nConsider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas.\u201d\nTo be clear, planes _are_ tracked over the ocean, even in remote, non-radar\nareas. This is something the media hasn\u2019t been good at explaining.\nIt\u2019s a semantic discussion to some degree (what does \u201ctracking\u201d mean?), but\nheadlines the likes of \u201cU.N. to Consider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas,\u201d and\nsimilar phrasings, which have been rampant, give people the impression that\nonce a plane hits oceanic airspace, it effectively disappears until making\nlandfall on the other side. This is _not_ the case, at all.\nCrews are _always_ in touch with both air traffic control _and_ company\npersonnel on the ground, and both of these entities are following and tracking\nyou. Tranponders aren\u2019t used in non-radar areas, but you\u2019ve also got HF radio,\nSATCOM, CPDLC, FMC datalink and so forth. Which equipment you\u2019re using to\ncommunicate depends where you are and which air traffic control facility\nyou\u2019re working with.\nWhat happened in the case of flight 370, of course, is that all of this\nequipment stopped working \u2014 it was either switched off intentionally, or\nfailed. The plane wasn\u2019t being tracked because the communications equipment\nwas dead. We can and perhaps should argue whether some sort of fail-safe,\nindependently powered locator signal ought to be installed aboard transoceanic\naircraft, able to transmit latitude and longitude position, but in normal\noperations the existing equipment works quite well, and is a lot more\nsophisticated than people are being led to believe.\nThe _Times_ story also segued into an annoying and misleading discussion about\n\u2014 here we go again \u2014 why it is that pilots are able to turn a transponder\n_off_. The comments of retired pilot Robert Hilb were especially frustrating.\nTo cut and paste from a prior post (which you can read further down this\npage)\u2026\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for _three reasons_ :\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are not monitored by\nradar, and transponders are not used for tracking. We keep the units turned on\nbecause the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story only when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\n\nIT\u2019S AMAZING how this story has fallen off the table. The big TV networks\n(this means you CNN) finally faced up to the fact they couldn\u2019t keep leading,\nhour after hour, with a story that wasn\u2019t changing. The jet was missing, and\nit kept on being missing, and here we are in the middle of April and it\u2019s\n_still_ missing.\nCount me among those who feel that this is how it ends: a mystery. The plane\nis out there somewhere, at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, and in all\nlikelihood we\u2019re not going to find it. Even if the wreckage can be pinpointed,\ndredging up the black boxes from 15,000 feet of seawater would itself be a\nmonumental task. And even with the recorders salvaged we might not learn what\nhappened.\nMy hunch is that a malfunction, rather than foul play, brought the plane down.\nA poorly handled decompression, for example, caused by a structural problem or\nwindscreen failure. Or a catastrophic electrical failure combined with smoke,\nfire or fumes that rendered the crew unconscious. Granted that doesn\u2019t totally\njibe with the evidence, but _none_ of the theories do. Not ruling anything\nout, including the possibility of a pilot suicide mission. I\u2019m somewhat\nmystified that more hasn\u2019t been made of the captain\u2019s domestic situation \u2014 his\nfailing marriage and, according to some, unusual behavior \u2014 in the days\nleading up to the plane\u2019s disappearance.\nThis is how it goes sometimes. The archives of aviation accidents, rare as\nthey might be, contain numerous unsolved disasters \u2014 including aircraft that\nhave never been found or recovered. The fate of Malaysia 370, it looks like,\nwill be added to the list.\n\n\nTHE MEDIA really needs a chill pill. And for the love of heaven, would people\n_please_ stop talking about transponders. National Public Radio host Robert\nSiegel was on the air yesterday, the latest in a know-nothing chorus\ncomplaining about the ability of pilots to turn transponders off, clearly\npossessing little or no idea how the devices actually work.\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for three reasons:\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are _not_ monitored by\nradar, and transponders are _not_ used for tracking. We keep the units turned\non because the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story _only_ when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, _it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway_.\n\n\nACCORDING TO Reason.org, a new Reason-Rupe poll finds 35 percent of Americans\nthink a mechanical problem caused Malaysia Airlines flight 370 to crash; 22\npercent believe the pilots crashed the plane intentionally; 12 percent feel it\nwas destroyed by terrorists; 9 percent say the plane landed safely and is in\nhiding; 5 percent believe the disappearance is related to supernatural or\nalien activity; and 3 percent think it was shot down by a foreign government.\nThat\u2019s slightly more encouraging than I expected, with some 57 percent of\npeople overall hewing to what have been, from the start, the two most credible\navenues of possibility: mechanical problem or rogue crew hijacking.\n\n\nI\u2019VE READ AND HEARD some pretty asinine characterizations of airline pilots\nbefore, but rarely have I come across anything as absurd, inaccurate, or\nirresponsible as what was printed on the front page of the March 28-30 weekend\ninternational edition of USA Today.\nI\u2019m talking about the story by Mahi Ramakrishnan headlined, \u201cFlight Change\nBlamed on Pilot.\u201d (A slightly different version of this story ran in the March\n27th U.S. edition.)\n\u201cThe pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is believed to be solely\nresponsible for steering the flight hundreds of miles off course\u2026\u201d begins the\nstory. Right away I feel an ulcer coming on.\nI find it almost inconceivable that after decades of covering commercial\naviation, USA Today would fail to understand there is always a minimum of\n_two_ pilots in the cockpit: a captain and a first officer. The latter is\nknown colloquially as the copilot, but they _both_ are fully qualified pilots.\nThey _both_ perform takeoffs and landings, and _both_ are certified to operate\nthe aircraft in all regimes of flight. A first officer is not an apprentice.\nIn fact, owing to the quirks of the airline seniority system, it is not\nunheard of for the first officer to be older and more experienced than the\ncaptain. More here.\nHow many times have I been through this? I\u2019ve explained it repeatedly in blog\npostings, articles, and in my book. I have no idea how many people have been\nlistening, but in one fell swoop USA Today has misinformed hundreds of\nthousands of readers.\nBut wait, it gets worse\u2026\nLater in the same story we are told that one of the Malaysian investigators\nsaid of the crew, \u201cOnly the captain possessed the experience and expertise to\nfly the plane.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure what disturbs me more: that an accident investigator would say\nsuch a nonsensical and untrue thing, or that USA Today didn\u2019t have the common\nsense to vet it. I can\u2019t believe that nobody on the editorial staff of a paper\nthat runs so many airlines stories, and that caters to travelers, didn\u2019t at\nleast flag this statement for review.\nThe idea that a first officer on a Boeing 777 wouldn\u2019t have the experience or\nexpertise to operate the aircraft on his own is beyond preposterous. Why the\ninvestigator would assert otherwise, if in fact the quote was interpreted\ncorrectly, I have no idea.\nThe details of the Malaysia Airlines mystery have been subject to enough\nmisinterpretation and general media overboiling as it is. This puts things\nover the top, into the realm of total and complete nonsense.\nAnd hang on, there\u2019s more\u2026\nThe same issue of USA Today, on page 10A, features a letter to the editor by a\nman from Minnesota named Tom O\u2019Mara. His topic is the tracking of commercial\nflights. He asks that we \u201cdemand that airlines track all their flights from\ntakeoff to landing.\u201d Five dollars per passenger, he submits, ought to be\ninvested in a \u201ctracking system for commercial flights over the ocean.\u201d\nThe problem here is that commercial flights are tracked over the oceans. Air\ncrews must always be in contact with both air traffic control and company\ndispatchers on the ground. Most intercontinental aircraft have datalink or\nsatellite communications systems that allow for constant real-time tracking.\nOf course, this equipment works only so long as it\u2019s powered. A fire, failure,\nor act of sabotage can render it inoperative \u2014 no different, I would presume,\nfrom any piece of equipment in any application in any industry. Maybe that\u2019s\nO\u2019Mara\u2019s point; possibly he\u2019s arguing for some type of fail-safe tracking\nmechanism that can\u2019t be destroyed or turned off? But he doesn\u2019t say so, and\nthe tone and implication of his letter is simple and clear enough: planes are\nnot tracked.\nWhich is untrue. And here the newspaper again drops the ball, by publishing a\nletter based on a false premise.\n\n\nTHE GRAPHICS ON CNN say \u201cBreaking News\u2026\u201d followed by, \u201cThere is no new\ninformation in the disappearance of flight MH370.\u201d Can\u2019t make this up.\nMalaysian authorities, meanwhile, have put out the blockbuster announcement\nthat they are confident the plane crashed into the sea. Damn, and all this\ntime I believed the jet was hidden away in a hangar somewhere on a \u201cremote\nairstrip.\u201d\nExcept of course that plenty of people really do subscribe to such an idea.\nAnd it\u2019s this conspiracy mongering that\u2019s the most discouraging and\ndistracting aspect of this entire story. How it got there we don\u2019t yet know \u2014\nand we may never know \u2014 but there is an extremely high certainty that the\nplane is in the Indian ocean. This is by far the likeliest possibility, and I\nwish the TV networks would cease and desist from giving further credence to\nnotions of a kidnapping conspiracy. There is zero evidence to support such a\nclaim, and analytically it makes no sense. Some buffoon was on Fox News the\nother night saying, \u201cThis has all the makings of a hostage situation.\u201d\nActually, it has _none_ of the makings of a hostage situation.\nNot that I\u2019m shocked that so many people are willing to accept these ideas.\nWhat is it about our society nowadays that foments such fanciful and illogical\nlines of thinking?\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a bullet-point look at some of the topics and theories we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from the start:\n **TRANSPONDERS** The media has been throwing this term around without a full\nunderstanding of how the equipment works. See my explanation at the top of\nthis post.\n **\u201cALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT\u201d** If I hear one more person attempt to make\nsomething of the first officer\u2019s final words to air traffic control \u2014 \u201call\nright, good night\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to hit the roof. There is _nothing_ unusual\nabout this salutation. While it sounds cryptic in the context of the ongoing\nmystery, it\u2019s a perfectly normal sign-off \u2014 the kind of thing pilots say to\ncontrollers _all the time_.\n **THE RADAR RUSE** I\u2019m talking about this post, by an aviation enthusiast\nnamed Keith Ledgerwood. His hypothesis is that the missing Malaysia Airlines\njet had tucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019\nradar signatures to appear as one. Thus disguised, the Malaysia jet flew on,\nundetected for hours before eventually breaking off and landing at an airfield\nin\u2026? See that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about this idea. It fails to offer any\nexplanation as to how, once separating from the Singapore flight, the Malaysia\njet could have completed its secret diversion without being seen \u2014 to say\nnothing of _why_ such a difficult and elaborate plot would be put in motion to\nbegin with. It makes very little sense, other than it allows an aviation\nhobbyist to show off a little, and provides more fodder for a media starved of\nuseful information. Beyond that, if the Malaysia plane had been directly below\nthe Singapore 777, the latter\u2019s radar altimeter would have shown it. The radar\naltimeter is a device that displays physical distance, in feet, to an object\nbelow. (They differ from a plane\u2019s main altimeters, which reference height\nabove sea level.) In normal operations that object is the ground, but during\ncruise they commonly pick up crossing traffic, momentarily showing planes as\nthey pass beneath. So, ask the Singapore crew: was your radar altimeter\nflashing on and off, showing some sort of object below you?\n **FIRE OR FUMES?** This theory has gotten a ton of attention thanks to a\nWired magazine story penned by a general aviation pilot named Chris\nGoodfellow. He proposes that the flight\u2019s sudden turn off course was a\nresponse to an inflight emergency \u2014 an intentional deviation forced by an\nelectrical or cargo fire. While headed for an emergency landing, the crew was\novercome by smoke or fumes. Its autopilot on and course reprogrammed, the\nplane then continued on for a time before crashing. The theory is described in\nthe headline as \u201cstartlingly simple,\u201d though in fact there\u2019s nothing startling\nabout it, and Goodfellow more or less repeats what _I_ said in a post back on\nMarch 14th. That a fire would be potent enough knock out communications and\nincapacitate the crew, yet not destroy the aircraft very quickly, is certainly\na sticking point, but neither is it impossible.\n **THE TERRORIST PLOT** If indeed this was a hijacking, did the plane land\nsomewhere, as some are suggesting, possibly to be used later as an airborne\nweapon of some kind, perhaps loaded with a nuclear or biological weapon? I\n_seriously_ doubt it. Remote as some airports are, the task of stealing and\nthen secretly landing and hiding a 777 would be exceptionally difficult. But\nmore than that, what sense would it make for a terrorist group steal a\ncommercial jetliner full of passengers from one of the most prestigious\nairlines in the world, guaranteeing that everybody on the planet will be\nlooking for it? There are hundreds or even thousand of cargo planes and\nbusiness jets that move around the world each day more or less anonymously,\nany one of which would do the job equally as well as well, with only a small\nfraction of the attention. That\u2019s not to discount the possibility of a\nhijacking outright, but I can\u2019t imagine the plane actually landed somewhere.\nAs to other motives, remember that the long, long history of air piracy did\nnot begin and end with September 11th, 2001, so it\u2019s important not to view\nevery hijacking through the crucible of the 9/11 template. People hijack\nplanes for different reason. It may even have been a rogue crewmember.\n **REMOTE CONTROL** This one is full-on James Bond. We\u2019re told how the plane\u2019s\n\u201cflight computer,\u201d whatever that is, was hacked, allowing the plane to be\nflown remotely, like a drone, either to crash it into the ocean or carry it to\na secret airstrip somewhere. I\u2019m frustrated by how often this is suggested,\nbecause there is simply no way to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane. People seem to have a vastly exaggerated idea of how modern\njetliners are flown \u2014 that is, they vastly exaggerate the capabilities of\ncockpit automation, and what a person with access to this automation, whether\nfrom inside or outside the plane, would be able to do with it. People read and\nhear things out of context \u2014 simplified explanations and experimental\napplications of technology \u2014 and they extrapolate unrealistically. And it\u2019s\nnot as if the pilots don\u2019t monitor and crosscheck a plane\u2019s progress when its\nautoflight system is engaged. We are constantly doing that. If something were\nmessing with one or more of the system\u2019s modes, we\u2019d know it, and could easily\ndisengage that mode and fly using basic course, altitude, or power commands.\nWorst-case, we can switch the automation off completely and do everything by\nhand.\n **WHY NO PHONE CALLS?** Some have wondered why, assuming the jet was\nhijacked, passengers did not place cell phone calls to loved ones, as occurred\nduring the 9/11 attacks. Does the absence of call records suggest the\npassengers had been incapacitated somehow, or that the plane had met a sudden\nend? No. Unless an aircraft is flying low and within range of a cell tower,\ncellular calling from a plane _does not work_. Your phone _will not_ maintain\na signal. Some airplanes are equipped with special technology that permits\ncalling via satellite or using radio frequencies to transmit cellular calls,\nbut I\u2019m uncertain if Malaysia\u2019s 777s have this technology. Even if they do it\ncould have been intentionally turned off or suffered a power failure, no\ndifferent from the plane\u2019s other communications equipment.\n **THE MISSING MAYDAY** Lack of a mayday call: No matter an aircraft\u2019s\nlocation, the crew is _always_ in contact with both air traffic control and\ncompany ground staff. When flying in remote locations, however, this is often\na more involved process than simply picking up a microphone and talking.\nExactly how it\u2019s done depends on which equipment the plane is fitted with, and\nwhich ATC facility you\u2019re working with. Flying over open ocean, relaying even\na simple message can be a multi-step process transmitted through FMS datalink\nor over high frequency radio. In an emergency, communicating with the ground\nis secondary to dealing with the problems at hand. As the old adage goes: you\naviate, navigate, and communicate \u2014 in that order. And so, the fact that no\nmessages or distress signals were sent by the crew is _not_ surprising or an\nindicator of anything specific.\n **INTO ORBIT** Of the wackier ideas I\u2019ve been hearing, my favorite is the one\nthat goes like this: Would it be possible for the 777 to have climbed clear\nout of the atmosphere, so high that \u201cit disintegrated,\u201d went into orbit, or\notherwise became impossible to track or locate? In normal circumstances I\nwouldn\u2019t burden the rest of you with an answer to such nonsense, except that\nno fewer than _five_ readers already have asked some version of this question.\nThe answer is no. It is totally impossible for that to happen. At a certain\naltitude, a plane\u2019s engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings\nwill no longer provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to\nsustain flight. All commercial passenger jets have maximum certified cruising\naltitudes below 50,000 feet or so. And even this altitude isn\u2019t always\nreachable. The maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight,\nthe air temperature and other factors.\n **HYPOXIA** Could a rapid loss of cabin pressure, perhaps as a result of a\nfire or some other problem, rendered the flight crew, and possibly everyone\nelse on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane continued\non before eventually crashing. This is conceivable, yes (though maybe no more\nso than assorted other scenarios). Depressurizations by themselves are\nperfectly manageable and almost never fatal (see chapter two of my book for a\nstory about the time it happened to me), and something that all airline crews\ntrain for, but only _if_ the crew understands the problem and does what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do. See Helios Airways.\n **THE STOLEN PASSPORTS** Interpol says the Iranians with stolen passports\nwere migrants hoping to be smuggled into Europe. There are thousands of people\njetting around the world on forged or stolen documents, for a variety of shady\nreasons, but that doesn\u2019t make them terrorist bombers.\n **PILOT EXPERIENCE** It\u2019s doubtful this was any factor. The captain of the\nill-fated flight had logged close to 20,000 flight hours, a substantial total\nby any standard. The first officer (copilot), on the other hand, had fewer\nthan three thousand hours to his name. Pilots in North America \u2014 those like\nme, at any rate, who come up through the civilian ranks \u2014 generally accrue\nseveral thousand hours before landing a job with a major airline. We slog our\nway through the industry in a step-by-step process, building experience along\nthe way. Thus it would be unheard of to find a Boeing 777 copilot with such a\nsmall number of hours. In other areas of the world, the process is often\ndifferent. Pilots are frequently selected through so-called ab-initio\nprograms, hand-picked by carriers at a young age and trained from the start to\nfly jetliners. We can debate the perils of this method, but I tend to doubt\nit\u2019s anything more than a side note. Plus, flight hours in and of themselves\naren\u2019t necessarily a good measure of a pilot\u2019s skills or performance under\npressure. And any pilot, regardless of his or her logbook totals, and\nregardless of the airline, needs to meet some pretty rigorous training\nstandards before being signed off to fly a 777.\n\n\nAll we know for sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or\ncommunication from the crew. The culprit could be anything from sabotage to\nfire to a bizarre mechanical problem \u2014 or, as is so common in airline\ncatastrophes, some combination or compounding of human error and/or mechanical\nmalfunction.\nAnd all the while people keep asking \u201chow can a plane simply disappear?\u201d It\u2019s\nan idea that to many makes no sense in an age of instant and total\nconnectivity. But consider: if somebody yanks the power cord out of your\ncomputer, suddenly all the wonderful immediacy and connectivity of the\ninternet is effectively vanished. Similarly, all of the fancy equipment in a\n777\u2019s cockpit is only useful if it\u2019s actually _running_. Thus, together with\nan absence of primary radar over much of the ocean, the idea that a plane can\ndisappear becomes a lot more conceivable.\nAnd no matter who or what is to blame, we shouldn\u2019t let this latest tragedy\novershadow the fact that air travel remains remarkably safe. Worldwide, the\ntrend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement, to the\npoint where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial\naviation. Hopefully their number continues to diminish, but a certain number\nof accidents will always be inevitable. In some ways, the weirdness of this\nstory speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most\ncommon causes of crashes. Those that still occur tend to be more mysterious\nand strange than in decades past (have a look at the year 1985 some time, for\nan idea of how frequent large-scale air disasters once were).\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a\npresumed airplane crash to, really, a _mystery story_. It\u2019s the very missing-\nness of the plane that the public finds so captivating. If and when the\nwreckage is discovered, I have to wonder if suddenly people will stop paying\nsuch rapt attention. If so, that\u2019s too bad, because the question at hand ought\nto be what happened on board the jet, not _where is_ the jet.\nI say \u201cif and when\u201d because I think people need to reconcile with the\npossibility that the plane might _never_ be found. I know that sounds absurd\nin an age where fast and easy answers are taken for granted, but it could very\nwell happen.\n__________\n\n\nMalaysia Airlines was formed in the early 1970s after its predecessor,\nMalaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA), split to become Singapore Airlines and\nMalaysia Airlines. Both carriers are renowned for their outstanding passenger\nservice, and both have excellent safety records. Cabin crews of both airlines\nwear the iconic, floral pattern \u201cSarong Kabaya\u201d batik \u2014 a adaptation of the\ntraditional Malay kebaya blouse.\nMalaysia Airlines\u2019 logo, carried on its tails from the beginning, is an\nindigenous kite known as the Wau. True story: In 1993 I was in the city of\nKota Bahru, a conservative Islamic town in northern Malaysia close to the Thai\nborder, when we saw a group of little kids flying Wau kites. At the time I\ndidn\u2019t realize where the airline\u2019s logo had come from, but I recognized the\npattern immediately. It was one of those airline/culture crossover moments\nthat we aerophiles really savor.\n![Malaysia Airlines logo](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/03/Malaysia-Airlines-logo.jpg)\n\n\nRelated Story:  \nDATELINE BORNEO:MALAYSIA AIRLINES AND A TRIP TO THE EAST\n\n\nComments (1,334)\nJuly 26, 2016 \u00b7 Filed under Uncategorized\n![](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Reporter.jpg)\nDid the Gray Lady not learn its lesson after the Noah Gallagher Shannon\ndebacle?\nNow comes a story in the _Times_ \u2018s \u201cFrequent Flier\u201d column, in which reporter\nJoan Raymond recounts a tale from business traveler Greg Hill. Hill gives us\nthe following\u2026.\n _We were supposed to be flying into Midway International and the pilot\u2019s\napproach was long and slow. As we were coming in for the landing, not more\nthan 1,000 feet off the ground, the pilot made a sharp turn to the right. The\nturn was so tight that he seemed to bank at a 90-degree angle. I had the\nwindow seat and was looking straight down at the ground. I could hear alarm\nbells going off in the cockpit. Just as I was convinced we were going to flip\nover on our back like a turtle, and any turtle can tell you that is not a good\nthing, the plane went into another 90-degree turn. But this time, it was to\nthe left. I looked out the window again and I saw stars. It seemed the pilot\nconfused Chicago O\u2019Hare with Chicago Midway and was landing at the wrong\nairport. At the last minute either he or the control tower realized the\nproblem and he tried to correct his mistake. When we finally did land at\nMidway, the pilot bolted off the plane. I have never seen anyone move that\nfast. I haven\u2019t flown on that particular airline since._\nI cannot say for certain why Greg Hill\u2019s airplane may have made a pair of\nsharp turns on its approach to Midway, or why its approach was \u201clong and\nslow.\u201d There are several possibilities, none of which are terribly exciting:\nspacing vectors, for instance, or a last-minute runway change And as several\nemailers have pointed out, the circle-to-land approach to Midway\u2019s runway 22L\ntypically includes a series of low-altitude turns. This is normal, if\npotentially unsettling to some passengers. (The \u201cExpressway Visual\u201d to runway\n31 at La Guardia is a similarly action-packed, and perfectly routine arrival\npattern.) Hill says he hasn\u2019t flown this airline since. That\u2019s rich: avoiding\nan airline because its pilots did exactly what they were supposed to do.\nWhatever was going on, I am relatively certain that the crew mixing up O\u2019Hare\nand Midway airports was _not_ it. Hill\u2019s clever disclaimer here is the phrase,\n\u201cit seemed,\u201d which, despite his having no idea what actually happened, grants\nhim license to indict an airline crew for making a stupid mistake.\nAs for those \u201calarm bells,\u201d that could have been the autopilot disconnect\nalert, or a simple trim-in-motion alert, neither of which means anything\nunsafe or unusual.\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on Hill\u2019s use of the term, \u201cthe pilot.\u201d How many\ntimes have we been through this? There would have been at least _two_ fully\nqualified pilots in the cockpit, either of whom, captain or first officer, may\nhave been at the controls. And the notion that one of these pilots went\ndashing off the plane in a fit of embarrassment is too silly to entertain. (If\none of the pilots did exit quickly, more likely it was because he was trying\nto catch a commuter flight home.)\nI can also assure you that the angle of bank was nowhere remotely close to 90\ndegrees. This gets into something I call PEF or Passenger Embellishment\nFactor, the tendency for people to grossly exaggerate the sensations of flight\n(there\u2019s more about PEF in chapter two of my book). A commercial airliner will\nalmost never bank at more than about 25 degrees. That doesn\u2019t sound like much,\nbut a 25-degree turn appears awfully steep to the typical passenger, just the\nway a 20-degree climb or a five-degree nose-down descent appears much steeper\n(yes, five degrees is a fairly sharp descent angle). In a 60 degree bank,\nnever mind 90 degrees, the G-forces would be so powerful that a passenger\nwould barely be able to lift his or her feet from the floor.\nOver and over we see this in the media: when it comes to flying, _anything\ngoes_ , no matter how ignorant, untrue, or ill-informed. Call me uptight, but\nit angers me that passengers are routinely taken at their word. In this case,\nGreg Hill clearly knows nothing about flying, yet the most prestigious\nnewspaper in the world will go ahead and print an account in which, despite\nhaving no credible evidence, he accuses airline pilots of being lost and\nmaking reckless maneuvers. He couches it with the likes of \u201cit seemed,\u201d and\nsurely the paper will say that his subjective observations are just that, and\nfair game. (For the record, I\u2019m not a _Times_ -basher the way some people are;\nif I didn\u2019t think so highly of the paper to begin with, I wouldn\u2019t be so\noffended.) But of course this story will be quoted and passed along as fact.\nAnd it\u2019s precisely this kind of thing that helps perpetuate the many myths and\nfallacies of commercial air travel.\n\n\nRelated story: A Flight of Fancy\n\n\nComposite artwork by Patrick Smith  \nPhoto of Greg Hill by Ian Gutzmer for the _New York Times_\n\n\nComments (52)\nAugust 11, 2013 \u00b7 Filed under Uncategorized\n![](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WindowFace.jpg)\nWHEN THE HELL did everyone become an aviation expert?\nOn September 29th, The _New York Times_ published a caustic diatribe against\nAmerican Airlines written by the novelist Gary Shteyngart.

Earlier this week, the multi-nation team\ninvestigating the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 announced\nthat the hunt for the missing Boeing 777, which had been concentrated in the\nsoutheastern Indian Ocean, was at last being called off. After two years and\nover a hundred million search dollars, only a few scattered pieces of the\njetliner were found, washed ashore on isolated islands, presumably hundreds or\neven thousands of miles from the actual, unknown spot were the flight met its\nend.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised. I\u2019ve been saying from the start that we\nshould prepare for the possibility of the disaster remaining forever unsolved.\nIt happens this way sometimes. If it helps you feel better, the air crash\nannals contain numerous unsolved accidents. What makes this one different,\nmaybe, is that major air crashes are so rare to begin with nowadays. On top of\nthat, we\u2019ve come to expect and demand easy and fast solutions to pretty much\neverything, with a fetishized belief that \u201ctechnology,\u201d whatever that even\nmeans anymore, can answer any question and fix any problem.\n\nBut it can\u2019t. Sometimes nature wins. And that\u2019s what this is about,\nultimately: nature. The immensity of the ocean, both in breadth and depth,\nversus the comparative speck of a 777. Oh sure, radios, transponders,\nemergency locator transmitters, GPS, real-time position streaming, satellite\ntracking. All of that is fallible, one way or the other. The wreckage is out\nthere somewhere, nestled invisibly in some immense undersea fissure or canyon,\nin the ink-black darkness beneath thousands of feet of seawater. The search\nvessels may have swept right over it.\n\nThere are two possibilities, just as there always have been. One nefarious,\nthe other accidental. There\u2019s a new report out claiming that a computer\nbelonging to flight 370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a home simulator\nenthusiast, contained a simulated flight routing, deep into the Indian Ocean,\neerily similar to the route believed to have been flown by MH370 after contact\nwas lost. You can see the two routings, side-by-side, in this graphic.\nZaharie\u2019s possible \u201cdry run\u201d is the red one.\n\n![\\(Courtesy of Jeff Wise\\)](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Jeff-Wise-MH370.png)\n\n(Courtesy of Jeff Wise)\n\nThe similarities are startling \u2014 particularly the segment that backtracks\nnorthwesterly through the Straits of Malacca. Still, it\u2019s hard to say how much\nof a smoking gun this is, because it\u2019s one of many routings that Zaharie had\nsimulated. The latitude and longitude waypoints comprising the route had been\ndeleted from the software and were recovered by computer forensics experts.\nWas this done correctly? Are the waypoints accurate? Were they cherry picked\namong numerous others? What did the other simulations look like, and how many\nwere there?\n\nWithout more information, we can\u2019t discount scenarios involving mechanical\nmalfunction. One of the most compelling of these is the possibility of a\nmishandled cabin depressurization. High-altitude decompressions can be rapid\nor gradual, but either way it\u2019s critical that the pilots get their\nsupplemental oxygen masks on immediately. We imagine a situation where they\ndid not, becoming disoriented as they attempted to troubleshoot and organize a\ndiversion back to Kuala Lumpur or some other airport, getting only a partial \u2014\nor garbled \u2014 re-route into the plane\u2019s navigation system before falling\nunconscious. Eventually the plane passed the last programmed waypoint, then\ndefaulted to heading mode and wandered off into the southern Indian Ocean\nuntil running out of fuel. (Among the proponents of this theory is Christine\nNegroni, who details such a scenario in her upcoming book, The Crash\nDetectives.)\n\nOr perhaps they had no supplemental oxygen. On the 777-200, the supply bottle\nfor the pilots is located in a space below and just aft of the cockpit, close\nto the main avionics bay, through which much of the plane\u2019s communications\nequipment is routed. Some have speculated that the oxygen bottle could have\nexploded, knocking out nearby equipment, including transponder and ACARS (this\nwould explain the loss communications data just as the flight was crossing\ninto Vietnamese airspace) and, more critically, causing a decompression. The\npilots would have put their masks on, but with only residual oxygen left in\nthe lines, or perhaps none at all, they would quickly have succumbed to\nhypoxia. There have been serious incidents with oxygen bottles before,\nincluding ones on a Qantas 747.\n\nThese are plausible theories, yet they haven\u2019t gotten much traction \u2014 possibly\n_because_ they\u2019re plausible, unlike some of the more sensational ideas being\npassed around.\n\nThose ideas will never go away. And barring a small miracle, we\u2019ll never learn\nfor certain what happened.\n\n#### UPDATE: June 26, 2014\n\nWHO VETS THESE THINGS? In today\u2019s New York Times, it says, \u201cAngus Houston, the\nretired head of the Australian military who is overseeing the country\u2019s\nsearch, said in an interview earlier this month that he assumed the flight\nwould have been on autopilot even if a conscious pilot had been at the\ncontrols. That is because _a Boeing 777 is a very difficult plane to fly\nmanually_.\u201d\n\nThose italics are mine. They are mine because the statement is absurd. If\nanything a 777 is an _easy_ plane to fly manually.\n\nSure, the autopilot would have been engaged even with a conscious pilot at the\ncontrols. Virtually _all_ commercial aircraft have their autopilots engaged\nduring the cruise portion of flight. It has been this way since the 1940s. It\nhas nothing to do with the planes being difficult to fly. It\u2019s because hand-\nflying a jet for several hours, on a more or less straight course across the\nocean, would be incredibly tedious. Easy, but numbing and exhausting.\n\nThis is another example of the media relying on outside specialists (military\nsources, aeronautics professors, researchers and bureaucrats) to comment on\ncommercial airline operations \u2014 something they often know very little about.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest reports are saying that hypoxia \u2014 that is, the crew\nfalling unconscious due to lack of oxygen \u2014 appears to be the \u201cbest fit\u201d for\nthe MH 370 mystery. How this may have happened, if it did, remains unknown,\nbut possibilities include a cabin breach caused by a bomb or structural\nfailure, or a major pressurization malfunction. Pilots are trained to deal\nwith such things, and even a total loss of cabin pressure is seldom dangerous.\nBut, they have to respond quickly and appropriately.\n\nThe hypoxia idea has been there from the beginning (I\u2019m one of several people\nwho\u2019ve been citing it as a possibility, right from day one), but has been lost\namidst the more colorful theories of pilot suicide, hijacking, UFO abduction,\nand so forth.\n\nWith its occupants unconscious, the jet would have continued on its last\nprogrammed routing until running out of fuel and crashing. And no, to answer a\nquestion several readers have put forth, the jet would not have been guided\nvia autopilot to a smooth touchdown on the ocean surface.\n\nOnce the engines quit, the plane would have stayed stable for a certain amount\nof time, then eventually would have stalled and/or plummeted and crashed. How\nmuch time? It\u2019d somewhat depend on which modes of the autopilot had been\nengaged, as well as the plane\u2019s altitude and speed. If the engines failed\nsimultaneously (unlikely) the plane would stay aloft somewhat longer. If one\nengine failed before the other (much more likely), the resulting asymmetrical\nforces, without a pilot on hand to react, would have been quickly\ncatastrophic. See the Helios Airways accident in 2005, for an example.\n\n#### UPDATE: May 7, 2014\n\nJUST A FEW THOUGHTS on Matt Wald\u2019s _New York Times_ story, titled \u201cU.N. to\nConsider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, planes _are_ tracked over the ocean, even in remote, non-radar\nareas. This is something the media hasn\u2019t been good at explaining.\n\nIt\u2019s a semantic discussion to some degree (what does \u201ctracking\u201d mean?), but\nheadlines the likes of \u201cU.N. to Consider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas,\u201d and\nsimilar phrasings, which have been rampant, give people the impression that\nonce a plane hits oceanic airspace, it effectively disappears until making\nlandfall on the other side. This is _not_ the case, at all.\n\nCrews are _always_ in touch with both air traffic control _and_ company\npersonnel on the ground, and both of these entities are following and tracking\nyou. Tranponders aren\u2019t used in non-radar areas, but you\u2019ve also got HF radio,\nSATCOM, CPDLC, FMC datalink and so forth. Which equipment you\u2019re using to\ncommunicate depends where you are and which air traffic control facility\nyou\u2019re working with.\n\nWhat happened in the case of flight 370, of course, is that all of this\nequipment stopped working \u2014 it was either switched off intentionally, or\nfailed. The plane wasn\u2019t being tracked because the communications equipment\nwas dead. We can and perhaps should argue whether some sort of fail-safe,\nindependently powered locator signal ought to be installed aboard transoceanic\naircraft, able to transmit latitude and longitude position, but in normal\noperations the existing equipment works quite well, and is a lot more\nsophisticated than people are being led to believe.\n\nThe _Times_ story also segued into an annoying and misleading discussion about\n\u2014 here we go again \u2014 why it is that pilots are able to turn a transponder\n_off_. The comments of retired pilot Robert Hilb were especially frustrating.\nTo cut and paste from a prior post (which you can read further down this\npage)\u2026\n\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for _three reasons_ :\n\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\n\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are not monitored by\nradar, and transponders are not used for tracking. We keep the units turned on\nbecause the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story only when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 26, 2014\n\nIT\u2019S AMAZING how this story has fallen off the table. The big TV networks\n(this means you CNN) finally faced up to the fact they couldn\u2019t keep leading,\nhour after hour, with a story that wasn\u2019t changing. The jet was missing, and\nit kept on being missing, and here we are in the middle of April and it\u2019s\n_still_ missing.\n\nCount me among those who feel that this is how it ends: a mystery. The plane\nis out there somewhere, at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, and in all\nlikelihood we\u2019re not going to find it. Even if the wreckage can be pinpointed,\ndredging up the black boxes from 15,000 feet of seawater would itself be a\nmonumental task. And even with the recorders salvaged we might not learn what\nhappened.\n\nMy hunch is that a malfunction, rather than foul play, brought the plane down.\nA poorly handled decompression, for example, caused by a structural problem or\nwindscreen failure. Or a catastrophic electrical failure combined with smoke,\nfire or fumes that rendered the crew unconscious. Granted that doesn\u2019t totally\njibe with the evidence, but _none_ of the theories do. Not ruling anything\nout, including the possibility of a pilot suicide mission. I\u2019m somewhat\nmystified that more hasn\u2019t been made of the captain\u2019s domestic situation \u2014 his\nfailing marriage and, according to some, unusual behavior \u2014 in the days\nleading up to the plane\u2019s disappearance.\n\nThis is how it goes sometimes. The archives of aviation accidents, rare as\nthey might be, contain numerous unsolved disasters \u2014 including aircraft that\nhave never been found or recovered. The fate of Malaysia 370, it looks like,\nwill be added to the list.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 4, 2014\n\nTHE MEDIA really needs a chill pill. And for the love of heaven, would people\n_please_ stop talking about transponders. National Public Radio host Robert\nSiegel was on the air yesterday, the latest in a know-nothing chorus\ncomplaining about the ability of pilots to turn transponders off, clearly\npossessing little or no idea how the devices actually work.\n\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for three reasons:\n\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\n\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are _not_ monitored by\nradar, and transponders are _not_ used for tracking. We keep the units turned\non because the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story _only_ when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, _it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway_.\n\n#### UPDATE: April 3, 2014\n\nACCORDING TO Reason.org, a new Reason-Rupe poll finds 35 percent of Americans\nthink a mechanical problem caused Malaysia Airlines flight 370 to crash; 22\npercent believe the pilots crashed the plane intentionally; 12 percent feel it\nwas destroyed by terrorists; 9 percent say the plane landed safely and is in\nhiding; 5 percent believe the disappearance is related to supernatural or\nalien activity; and 3 percent think it was shot down by a foreign government.\n\nThat\u2019s slightly more encouraging than I expected, with some 57 percent of\npeople overall hewing to what have been, from the start, the two most credible\navenues of possibility: mechanical problem or rogue crew hijacking.\n\n#### UPDATE: March 30, 2014\n\nI\u2019VE READ AND HEARD some pretty asinine characterizations of airline pilots\nbefore, but rarely have I come across anything as absurd, inaccurate, or\nirresponsible as what was printed on the front page of the March 28-30 weekend\ninternational edition of USA Today.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the story by Mahi Ramakrishnan headlined, \u201cFlight Change\nBlamed on Pilot.\u201d (A slightly different version of this story ran in the March\n27th U.S. edition.)\n\n\u201cThe pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is believed to be solely\nresponsible for steering the flight hundreds of miles off course\u2026\u201d begins the\nstory. Right away I feel an ulcer coming on.\n\nI find it almost inconceivable that after decades of covering commercial\naviation, USA Today would fail to understand there is always a minimum of\n_two_ pilots in the cockpit: a captain and a first officer. The latter is\nknown colloquially as the copilot, but they _both_ are fully qualified pilots.\nThey _both_ perform takeoffs and landings, and _both_ are certified to operate\nthe aircraft in all regimes of flight. A first officer is not an apprentice.\nIn fact, owing to the quirks of the airline seniority system, it is not\nunheard of for the first officer to be older and more experienced than the\ncaptain. More here.\n\nHow many times have I been through this? I\u2019ve explained it repeatedly in blog\npostings, articles, and in my book. I have no idea how many people have been\nlistening, but in one fell swoop USA Today has misinformed hundreds of\nthousands of readers.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse\u2026\n\nLater in the same story we are told that one of the Malaysian investigators\nsaid of the crew, \u201cOnly the captain possessed the experience and expertise to\nfly the plane.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what disturbs me more: that an accident investigator would say\nsuch a nonsensical and untrue thing, or that USA Today didn\u2019t have the common\nsense to vet it. I can\u2019t believe that nobody on the editorial staff of a paper\nthat runs so many airlines stories, and that caters to travelers, didn\u2019t at\nleast flag this statement for review.\n\nThe idea that a first officer on a Boeing 777 wouldn\u2019t have the experience or\nexpertise to operate the aircraft on his own is beyond preposterous. Why the\ninvestigator would assert otherwise, if in fact the quote was interpreted\ncorrectly, I have no idea.\n\nThe details of the Malaysia Airlines mystery have been subject to enough\nmisinterpretation and general media overboiling as it is. This puts things\nover the top, into the realm of total and complete nonsense.\n\nAnd hang on, there\u2019s more\u2026\n\nThe same issue of USA Today, on page 10A, features a letter to the editor by a\nman from Minnesota named Tom O\u2019Mara. His topic is the tracking of commercial\nflights. He asks that we \u201cdemand that airlines track all their flights from\ntakeoff to landing.\u201d Five dollars per passenger, he submits, ought to be\ninvested in a \u201ctracking system for commercial flights over the ocean.\u201d\n\nThe problem here is that commercial flights are tracked over the oceans. Air\ncrews must always be in contact with both air traffic control and company\ndispatchers on the ground. Most intercontinental aircraft have datalink or\nsatellite communications systems that allow for constant real-time tracking.\n\nOf course, this equipment works only so long as it\u2019s powered. A fire, failure,\nor act of sabotage can render it inoperative \u2014 no different, I would presume,\nfrom any piece of equipment in any application in any industry. Maybe that\u2019s\nO\u2019Mara\u2019s point; possibly he\u2019s arguing for some type of fail-safe tracking\nmechanism that can\u2019t be destroyed or turned off? But he doesn\u2019t say so, and\nthe tone and implication of his letter is simple and clear enough: planes are\nnot tracked.\n\nWhich is untrue. And here the newspaper again drops the ball, by publishing a\nletter based on a false premise.\n\n#### UPDATE: March 27, 2014\n\nTHE GRAPHICS ON CNN say \u201cBreaking News\u2026\u201d followed by, \u201cThere is no new\ninformation in the disappearance of flight MH370.\u201d Can\u2019t make this up.\n\nMalaysian authorities, meanwhile, have put out the blockbuster announcement\nthat they are confident the plane crashed into the sea. Damn, and all this\ntime I believed the jet was hidden away in a hangar somewhere on a \u201cremote\nairstrip.\u201d\n\nExcept of course that plenty of people really do subscribe to such an idea.\nAnd it\u2019s this conspiracy mongering that\u2019s the most discouraging and\ndistracting aspect of this entire story. How it got there we don\u2019t yet know \u2014\nand we may never know \u2014 but there is an extremely high certainty that the\nplane is in the Indian ocean. This is by far the likeliest possibility, and I\nwish the TV networks would cease and desist from giving further credence to\nnotions of a kidnapping conspiracy. There is zero evidence to support such a\nclaim, and analytically it makes no sense. Some buffoon was on Fox News the\nother night saying, \u201cThis has all the makings of a hostage situation.\u201d\nActually, it has _none_ of the makings of a hostage situation.\n\nNot that I\u2019m shocked that so many people are willing to accept these ideas.\nWhat is it about our society nowadays that foments such fanciful and illogical\nlines of thinking?\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a bullet-point look at some of the topics and theories we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from the start:\n\n**TRANSPONDERS** The media has been throwing this term around without a full\nunderstanding of how the equipment works. See my explanation at the top of\nthis post.\n\n**\u201cALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT\u201d** If I hear one more person attempt to make\nsomething of the first officer\u2019s final words to air traffic control \u2014 \u201call\nright, good night\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to hit the roof. There is _nothing_ unusual\nabout this salutation. While it sounds cryptic in the context of the ongoing\nmystery, it\u2019s a perfectly normal sign-off \u2014 the kind of thing pilots say to\ncontrollers _all the time_.\n\n**THE RADAR RUSE** I\u2019m talking about this post, by an aviation enthusiast\nnamed Keith Ledgerwood. His hypothesis is that the missing Malaysia Airlines\njet had tucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019\nradar signatures to appear as one. Thus disguised, the Malaysia jet flew on,\nundetected for hours before eventually breaking off and landing at an airfield\nin\u2026? See that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about this idea. It fails to offer any\nexplanation as to how, once separating from the Singapore flight, the Malaysia\njet could have completed its secret diversion without being seen \u2014 to say\nnothing of _why_ such a difficult and elaborate plot would be put in motion to\nbegin with. It makes very little sense, other than it allows an aviation\nhobbyist to show off a little, and provides more fodder for a media starved of\nuseful information. Beyond that, if the Malaysia plane had been directly below\nthe Singapore 777, the latter\u2019s radar altimeter would have shown it. The radar\naltimeter is a device that displays physical distance, in feet, to an object\nbelow. (They differ from a plane\u2019s main altimeters, which reference height\nabove sea level.) In normal operations that object is the ground, but during\ncruise they commonly pick up crossing traffic, momentarily showing planes as\nthey pass beneath. So, ask the Singapore crew: was your radar altimeter\nflashing on and off, showing some sort of object below you?\n\n**FIRE OR FUMES?** This theory has gotten a ton of attention thanks to a Wired\nmagazine story penned by a general aviation pilot named Chris Goodfellow. He\nproposes that the flight\u2019s sudden turn off course was a response to an\ninflight emergency \u2014 an intentional deviation forced by an electrical or cargo\nfire. While headed for an emergency landing, the crew was overcome by smoke or\nfumes. Its autopilot on and course reprogrammed, the plane then continued on\nfor a time before crashing. The theory is described in the headline as\n\u201cstartlingly simple,\u201d though in fact there\u2019s nothing startling about it, and\nGoodfellow more or less repeats what _I_ said in a post back on March 14th.\nThat a fire would be potent enough knock out communications and incapacitate\nthe crew, yet not destroy the aircraft very quickly, is certainly a sticking\npoint, but neither is it impossible.\n\n**THE TERRORIST PLOT** If indeed this was a hijacking, did the plane land\nsomewhere, as some are suggesting, possibly to be used later as an airborne\nweapon of some kind, perhaps loaded with a nuclear or biological weapon? I\n_seriously_ doubt it. Remote as some airports are, the task of stealing and\nthen secretly landing and hiding a 777 would be exceptionally difficult. But\nmore than that, what sense would it make for a terrorist group steal a\ncommercial jetliner full of passengers from one of the most prestigious\nairlines in the world, guaranteeing that everybody on the planet will be\nlooking for it? There are hundreds or even thousand of cargo planes and\nbusiness jets that move around the world each day more or less anonymously,\nany one of which would do the job equally as well as well, with only a small\nfraction of the attention. That\u2019s not to discount the possibility of a\nhijacking outright, but I can\u2019t imagine the plane actually landed somewhere.\nAs to other motives, remember that the long, long history of air piracy did\nnot begin and end with September 11th, 2001, so it\u2019s important not to view\nevery hijacking through the crucible of the 9/11 template. People hijack\nplanes for different reason. It may even have been a rogue crewmember.\n\n**REMOTE CONTROL** This one is full-on James Bond. We\u2019re told how the plane\u2019s\n\u201cflight computer,\u201d whatever that is, was hacked, allowing the plane to be\nflown remotely, like a drone, either to crash it into the ocean or carry it to\na secret airstrip somewhere. I\u2019m frustrated by how often this is suggested,\nbecause there is simply no way to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane. People seem to have a vastly exaggerated idea of how modern\njetliners are flown \u2014 that is, they vastly exaggerate the capabilities of\ncockpit automation, and what a person with access to this automation, whether\nfrom inside or outside the plane, would be able to do with it. People read and\nhear things out of context \u2014 simplified explanations and experimental\napplications of technology \u2014 and they extrapolate unrealistically. And it\u2019s\nnot as if the pilots don\u2019t monitor and crosscheck a plane\u2019s progress when its\nautoflight system is engaged. We are constantly doing that. If something were\nmessing with one or more of the system\u2019s modes, we\u2019d know it, and could easily\ndisengage that mode and fly using basic course, altitude, or power commands.\nWorst-case, we can switch the automation off completely and do everything by\nhand.\n\n**WHY NO PHONE CALLS?** Some have wondered why, assuming the jet was hijacked,\npassengers did not place cell phone calls to loved ones, as occurred during\nthe 9/11 attacks. Does the absence of call records suggest the passengers had\nbeen incapacitated somehow, or that the plane had met a sudden end? No. Unless\nan aircraft is flying low and within range of a cell tower, cellular calling\nfrom a plane _does not work_. Your phone _will not_ maintain a signal. Some\nairplanes are equipped with special technology that permits calling via\nsatellite or using radio frequencies to transmit cellular calls, but I\u2019m\nuncertain if Malaysia\u2019s 777s have this technology. Even if they do it could\nhave been intentionally turned off or suffered a power failure, no different\nfrom the plane\u2019s other communications equipment.\n\n**THE MISSING MAYDAY** Lack of a mayday call: No matter an aircraft\u2019s\nlocation, the crew is _always_ in contact with both air traffic control and\ncompany ground staff. When flying in remote locations, however, this is often\na more involved process than simply picking up a microphone and talking.\nExactly how it\u2019s done depends on which equipment the plane is fitted with, and\nwhich ATC facility you\u2019re working with. Flying over open ocean, relaying even\na simple message can be a multi-step process transmitted through FMS datalink\nor over high frequency radio. In an emergency, communicating with the ground\nis secondary to dealing with the problems at hand. As the old adage goes: you\naviate, navigate, and communicate \u2014 in that order. And so, the fact that no\nmessages or distress signals were sent by the crew is _not_ surprising or an\nindicator of anything specific.\n\n**INTO ORBIT** Of the wackier ideas I\u2019ve been hearing, my favorite is the one\nthat goes like this: Would it be possible for the 777 to have climbed clear\nout of the atmosphere, so high that \u201cit disintegrated,\u201d went into orbit, or\notherwise became impossible to track or locate? In normal circumstances I\nwouldn\u2019t burden the rest of you with an answer to such nonsense, except that\nno fewer than _five_ readers already have asked some version of this question.\nThe answer is no. It is totally impossible for that to happen. At a certain\naltitude, a plane\u2019s engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings\nwill no longer provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to\nsustain flight. All commercial passenger jets have maximum certified cruising\naltitudes below 50,000 feet or so. And even this altitude isn\u2019t always\nreachable. The maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight,\nthe air temperature and other factors.\n\n**HYPOXIA** Could a rapid loss of cabin pressure, perhaps as a result of a\nfire or some other problem, rendered the flight crew, and possibly everyone\nelse on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane continued\non before eventually crashing. This is conceivable, yes (though maybe no more\nso than assorted other scenarios). Depressurizations by themselves are\nperfectly manageable and almost never fatal (see chapter two of my book for a\nstory about the time it happened to me), and something that all airline crews\ntrain for, but only _if_ the crew understands the problem and does what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do. See Helios Airways.\n\n**THE STOLEN PASSPORTS** Interpol says the Iranians with stolen passports were\nmigrants hoping to be smuggled into Europe. There are thousands of people\njetting around the world on forged or stolen documents, for a variety of shady\nreasons, but that doesn\u2019t make them terrorist bombers.\n\n**PILOT EXPERIENCE** It\u2019s doubtful this was any factor. The captain of the\nill-fated flight had logged close to 20,000 flight hours, a substantial total\nby any standard. The first officer (copilot), on the other hand, had fewer\nthan three thousand hours to his name. Pilots in North America \u2014 those like\nme, at any rate, who come up through the civilian ranks \u2014 generally accrue\nseveral thousand hours before landing a job with a major airline. We slog our\nway through the industry in a step-by-step process, building experience along\nthe way. Thus it would be unheard of to find a Boeing 777 copilot with such a\nsmall number of hours. In other areas of the world, the process is often\ndifferent. Pilots are frequently selected through so-called ab-initio\nprograms, hand-picked by carriers at a young age and trained from the start to\nfly jetliners. We can debate the perils of this method, but I tend to doubt\nit\u2019s anything more than a side note. Plus, flight hours in and of themselves\naren\u2019t necessarily a good measure of a pilot\u2019s skills or performance under\npressure. And any pilot, regardless of his or her logbook totals, and\nregardless of the airline, needs to meet some pretty rigorous training\nstandards before being signed off to fly a 777.\n\nAll we know for sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or\ncommunication from the crew. The culprit could be anything from sabotage to\nfire to a bizarre mechanical problem \u2014 or, as is so common in airline\ncatastrophes, some combination or compounding of human error and/or mechanical\nmalfunction.\n\nAnd all the while people keep asking \u201chow can a plane simply disappear?\u201d It\u2019s\nan idea that to many makes no sense in an age of instant and total\nconnectivity. But consider: if somebody yanks the power cord out of your\ncomputer, suddenly all the wonderful immediacy and connectivity of the\ninternet is effectively vanished. Similarly, all of the fancy equipment in a\n777\u2019s cockpit is only useful if it\u2019s actually _running_. Thus, together with\nan absence of primary radar over much of the ocean, the idea that a plane can\ndisappear becomes a lot more conceivable.\n\nAnd no matter who or what is to blame, we shouldn\u2019t let this latest tragedy\novershadow the fact that air travel remains remarkably safe. Worldwide, the\ntrend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement, to the\npoint where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial\naviation. Hopefully their number continues to diminish, but a certain number\nof accidents will always be inevitable. In some ways, the weirdness of this\nstory speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most\ncommon causes of crashes. Those that still occur tend to be more mysterious\nand strange than in decades past (have a look at the year 1985 some time, for\nan idea of how frequent large-scale air disasters once were).\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a\npresumed airplane crash to, really, a _mystery story_. It\u2019s the very missing-\nness of the plane that the public finds so captivating. If and when the\nwreckage is discovered, I have to wonder if suddenly people will stop paying\nsuch rapt attention. If so, that\u2019s too bad, because the question at hand ought\nto be what happened on board the jet, not _where is_ the jet.\n\nI say \u201cif and when\u201d because I think people need to reconcile with the\npossibility that the plane might _never_ be found. I know that sounds absurd\nin an age where fast and easy answers are taken for granted, but it could very\nwell happen.\n\n__________\n\nMalaysia Airlines was formed in the early 1970s after its predecessor,\nMalaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA), split to become Singapore Airlines and\nMalaysia Airlines. Both carriers are renowned for their outstanding passenger\nservice, and both have excellent safety records. Cabin crews of both airlines\nwear the iconic, floral pattern \u201cSarong Kabaya\u201d batik \u2014 a adaptation of the\ntraditional Malay kebaya blouse.\n\nMalaysia Airlines\u2019 logo, carried on its tails from the beginning, is an\nindigenous kite known as the Wau. True story: In 1993 I was in the city of\nKota Bahru, a conservative Islamic town in northern Malaysia close to the Thai\nborder, when we saw a group of little kids flying Wau kites. At the time I\ndidn\u2019t realize where the airline\u2019s logo had come from, but I recognized the\npattern immediately. It was one of those airline/culture crossover moments\nthat we aerophiles really savor.\n\n![Malaysia Airlines logo](https://www.askthepilot.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/03/Malaysia-Airlines-logo.jpg)\n\nRelated Story:  \nDATELINE BORNEO:MALAYSIA AIRLINES AND A TRIP TO THE EAST\nSO THIS is what it comes down to. Earlier this week, the multi-nation team\ninvestigating the 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 announced\nthat the hunt for the missing Boeing 777, which had been concentrated in the\nsoutheastern Indian Ocean, was at last being called off. After two years and\nover a hundred million search dollars, only a few scattered pieces of the\njetliner were found, washed ashore on isolated islands, presumably hundreds or\neven thousands of miles from the actual, unknown spot were the flight met its\nend.\nI\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised. I\u2019ve been saying from the start that we\nshould prepare for the possibility of the disaster remaining forever unsolved.\nIt happens this way sometimes. If it helps you feel better, the air crash\nannals contain numerous unsolved accidents. What makes this one different,\nmaybe, is that major air crashes are so rare to begin with nowadays. On top of\nthat, we\u2019ve come to expect and demand easy and fast solutions to pretty much\neverything, with a fetishized belief that \u201ctechnology,\u201d whatever that even\nmeans anymore, can answer any question and fix any problem.\nBut it can\u2019t. Sometimes nature wins. And that\u2019s what this is about,\nultimately: nature. The immensity of the ocean, both in breadth and depth,\nversus the comparative speck of a 777. Oh sure, radios, transponders,\nemergency locator transmitters, GPS, real-time position streaming, satellite\ntracking. All of that is fallible, one way or the other. The wreckage is out\nthere somewhere, nestled invisibly in some immense undersea fissure or canyon,\nin the ink-black darkness beneath thousands of feet of seawater. The search\nvessels may have swept right over it.\nThere are two possibilities, just as there always have been. One nefarious,\nthe other accidental. There\u2019s a new report out claiming that a computer\nbelonging to flight 370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a home simulator\nenthusiast, contained a simulated flight routing, deep into the Indian Ocean,\neerily similar to the route believed to have been flown by MH370 after contact\nwas lost. You can see the two routings, side-by-side, in this graphic.\nZaharie\u2019s possible \u201cdry run\u201d is the red one.\n(Courtesy of Jeff Wise)\nThe similarities are startling \u2014 particularly the segment that backtracks\nnorthwesterly through the Straits of Malacca. Still, it\u2019s hard to say how much\nof a smoking gun this is, because it\u2019s one of many routings that Zaharie had\nsimulated. The latitude and longitude waypoints comprising the route had been\ndeleted from the software and were recovered by computer forensics experts.\nWas this done correctly? Are the waypoints accurate? Were they cherry picked\namong numerous others? What did the other simulations look like, and how many\nwere there?\nWithout more information, we can\u2019t discount scenarios involving mechanical\nmalfunction. One of the most compelling of these is the possibility of a\nmishandled cabin depressurization. High-altitude decompressions can be rapid\nor gradual, but either way it\u2019s critical that the pilots get their\nsupplemental oxygen masks on immediately. We imagine a situation where they\ndid not, becoming disoriented as they attempted to troubleshoot and organize a\ndiversion back to Kuala Lumpur or some other airport, getting only a partial \u2014\nor garbled \u2014 re-route into the plane\u2019s navigation system before falling\nunconscious. Eventually the plane passed the last programmed waypoint, then\ndefaulted to heading mode and wandered off into the southern Indian Ocean\nuntil running out of fuel. (Among the proponents of this theory is Christine\nNegroni, who details such a scenario in her upcoming book, The Crash\nDetectives.)\nOr perhaps they had no supplemental oxygen. On the 777-200, the supply bottle\nfor the pilots is located in a space below and just aft of the cockpit, close\nto the main avionics bay, through which much of the plane\u2019s communications\nequipment is routed. Some have speculated that the oxygen bottle could have\nexploded, knocking out nearby equipment, including transponder and ACARS (this\nwould explain the loss communications data just as the flight was crossing\ninto Vietnamese airspace) and, more critically, causing a decompression. The\npilots would have put their masks on, but with only residual oxygen left in\nthe lines, or perhaps none at all, they would quickly have succumbed to\nhypoxia. There have been serious incidents with oxygen bottles before,\nincluding ones on a Qantas 747.\nThese are plausible theories, yet they haven\u2019t gotten much traction \u2014 possibly\n_because_ they\u2019re plausible, unlike some of the more sensational ideas being\npassed around.\nThose ideas will never go away. And barring a small miracle, we\u2019ll never learn\nfor certain what happened.\n\n\nWHO VETS THESE THINGS? In today\u2019s New York Times, it says, \u201cAngus Houston, the\nretired head of the Australian military who is overseeing the country\u2019s\nsearch, said in an interview earlier this month that he assumed the flight\nwould have been on autopilot even if a conscious pilot had been at the\ncontrols. That is because _a Boeing 777 is a very difficult plane to fly\nmanually_.\u201d\nThose italics are mine. They are mine because the statement is absurd. If\nanything a 777 is an _easy_ plane to fly manually.\nSure, the autopilot would have been engaged even with a conscious pilot at the\ncontrols. Virtually _all_ commercial aircraft have their autopilots engaged\nduring the cruise portion of flight. It has been this way since the 1940s. It\nhas nothing to do with the planes being difficult to fly. It\u2019s because hand-\nflying a jet for several hours, on a more or less straight course across the\nocean, would be incredibly tedious. Easy, but numbing and exhausting.\nThis is another example of the media relying on outside specialists (military\nsources, aeronautics professors, researchers and bureaucrats) to comment on\ncommercial airline operations \u2014 something they often know very little about.\nMeanwhile, the latest reports are saying that hypoxia \u2014 that is, the crew\nfalling unconscious due to lack of oxygen \u2014 appears to be the \u201cbest fit\u201d for\nthe MH 370 mystery. How this may have happened, if it did, remains unknown,\nbut possibilities include a cabin breach caused by a bomb or structural\nfailure, or a major pressurization malfunction. Pilots are trained to deal\nwith such things, and even a total loss of cabin pressure is seldom dangerous.\nBut, they have to respond quickly and appropriately.\nThe hypoxia idea has been there from the beginning (I\u2019m one of several people\nwho\u2019ve been citing it as a possibility, right from day one), but has been lost\namidst the more colorful theories of pilot suicide, hijacking, UFO abduction,\nand so forth.\nWith its occupants unconscious, the jet would have continued on its last\nprogrammed routing until running out of fuel and crashing. And no, to answer a\nquestion several readers have put forth, the jet would not have been guided\nvia autopilot to a smooth touchdown on the ocean surface.\nOnce the engines quit, the plane would have stayed stable for a certain amount\nof time, then eventually would have stalled and/or plummeted and crashed. How\nmuch time? It\u2019d somewhat depend on which modes of the autopilot had been\nengaged, as well as the plane\u2019s altitude and speed. If the engines failed\nsimultaneously (unlikely) the plane would stay aloft somewhat longer. If one\nengine failed before the other (much more likely), the resulting asymmetrical\nforces, without a pilot on hand to react, would have been quickly\ncatastrophic. See the Helios Airways accident in 2005, for an example.\n\n\nJUST A FEW THOUGHTS on Matt Wald\u2019s _New York Times_ story, titled \u201cU.N. to\nConsider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas.\u201d\nTo be clear, planes _are_ tracked over the ocean, even in remote, non-radar\nareas. This is something the media hasn\u2019t been good at explaining.\nIt\u2019s a semantic discussion to some degree (what does \u201ctracking\u201d mean?), but\nheadlines the likes of \u201cU.N. to Consider Ways to Track Planes Over Seas,\u201d and\nsimilar phrasings, which have been rampant, give people the impression that\nonce a plane hits oceanic airspace, it effectively disappears until making\nlandfall on the other side. This is _not_ the case, at all.\nCrews are _always_ in touch with both air traffic control _and_ company\npersonnel on the ground, and both of these entities are following and tracking\nyou. Tranponders aren\u2019t used in non-radar areas, but you\u2019ve also got HF radio,\nSATCOM, CPDLC, FMC datalink and so forth. Which equipment you\u2019re using to\ncommunicate depends where you are and which air traffic control facility\nyou\u2019re working with.\nWhat happened in the case of flight 370, of course, is that all of this\nequipment stopped working \u2014 it was either switched off intentionally, or\nfailed. The plane wasn\u2019t being tracked because the communications equipment\nwas dead. We can and perhaps should argue whether some sort of fail-safe,\nindependently powered locator signal ought to be installed aboard transoceanic\naircraft, able to transmit latitude and longitude position, but in normal\noperations the existing equipment works quite well, and is a lot more\nsophisticated than people are being led to believe.\nThe _Times_ story also segued into an annoying and misleading discussion about\n\u2014 here we go again \u2014 why it is that pilots are able to turn a transponder\n_off_. The comments of retired pilot Robert Hilb were especially frustrating.\nTo cut and paste from a prior post (which you can read further down this\npage)\u2026\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for _three reasons_ :\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in. Second, in the interest of safety \u2014 namely, fire and\nelectrical system protection \u2014 it\u2019s important to have the ability to isolate a\npiece of equipment, either by a standard switch or, if need be, through a\ncircuit breaker. And third, transponders will occasionally malfunction and\ntransmit erroneous or incomplete data, at which point a crew will \u201ccycle\u201d the\ndevice or swap to another unit. Typically at least two transponders are\nonboard, and you can\u2019t run both simultaneously. Further, there are various\ntransponder subfunctions, or \u201cmodes\u201d as we call them \u2014 mode C, for example, or\nmode S \u2014 responsible for different data, and these can be turned off\nseparately.\nIn any case, with respect to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, a discussion\nof transponders is only partly relevant in the first place. For air traffic\ncontrol purposes, transponders only work in areas of ATC radar coverage. Once\nbeyond a certain distance from the coast, the oceans are not monitored by\nradar, and transponders are not used for tracking. We keep the units turned on\nbecause the TCAS anti-collision system is transponder-based, but we rely on\nSATCOM, ACARS, FMS datalink, and other means for position reports and\ncommunications. Thus transponders are pertinent to this story only when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway.\n\n\nIT\u2019S AMAZING how this story has fallen off the table. The big TV networks\n(this means you CNN) finally faced up to the fact they couldn\u2019t keep leading,\nhour after hour, with a story that wasn\u2019t changing. The jet was missing, and\nit kept on being missing, and here we are in the middle of April and it\u2019s\n_still_ missing.\nCount me among those who feel that this is how it ends: a mystery. The plane\nis out there somewhere, at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, and in all\nlikelihood we\u2019re not going to find it. Even if the wreckage can be pinpointed,\ndredging up the black boxes from 15,000 feet of seawater would itself be a\nmonumental task. And even with the recorders salvaged we might not learn what\nhappened.\nMy hunch is that a malfunction, rather than foul play, brought the plane down.\nA poorly handled decompression, for example, caused by a structural problem or\nwindscreen failure. Or a catastrophic electrical failure combined with smoke,\nfire or fumes that rendered the crew unconscious. Granted that doesn\u2019t totally\njibe with the evidence, but _none_ of the theories do. Not ruling anything\nout, including the possibility of a pilot suicide mission. I\u2019m somewhat\nmystified that more hasn\u2019t been made of the captain\u2019s domestic situation \u2014 his\nfailing marriage and, according to some, unusual behavior \u2014 in the days\nleading up to the plane\u2019s disappearance.\nThis is how it goes sometimes. The archives of aviation accidents, rare as\nthey might be, contain numerous unsolved disasters \u2014 including aircraft that\nhave never been found or recovered. The fate of Malaysia 370, it looks like,\nwill be added to the list.\n\n\nTHE MEDIA really needs a chill pill. And for the love of heaven, would people\n_please_ stop talking about transponders. National Public Radio host Robert\nSiegel was on the air yesterday, the latest in a know-nothing chorus\ncomplaining about the ability of pilots to turn transponders off, clearly\npossessing little or no idea how the devices actually work.\nThe ability to turn off a transponder exists for three reasons:\nThe first one is operational: to avoid cluttering up air traffic control\nradar, the unit is turned off when parked at the gate. We switch it on shortly\nbefore taxiing, then switch it off again (actually it\u2019s moved to a standby\nmode) after docking in.

Thus transponders are pertinent to this story _only_ when the\nmissing plane was close to land. Once over the open water, on or off, _it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway_.\n\n\nACCORDING TO Reason.org, a new Reason-Rupe poll finds 35 percent of Americans\nthink a mechanical problem caused Malaysia Airlines flight 370 to crash; 22\npercent believe the pilots crashed the plane intentionally; 12 percent feel it\nwas destroyed by terrorists; 9 percent say the plane landed safely and is in\nhiding; 5 percent believe the disappearance is related to supernatural or\nalien activity; and 3 percent think it was shot down by a foreign government.\nThat\u2019s slightly more encouraging than I expected, with some 57 percent of\npeople overall hewing to what have been, from the start, the two most credible\navenues of possibility: mechanical problem or rogue crew hijacking.\n\n\nI\u2019VE READ AND HEARD some pretty asinine characterizations of airline pilots\nbefore, but rarely have I come across anything as absurd, inaccurate, or\nirresponsible as what was printed on the front page of the March 28-30 weekend\ninternational edition of USA Today.\nI\u2019m talking about the story by Mahi Ramakrishnan headlined, \u201cFlight Change\nBlamed on Pilot.\u201d (A slightly different version of this story ran in the March\n27th U.S. edition.)\n\u201cThe pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is believed to be solely\nresponsible for steering the flight hundreds of miles off course\u2026\u201d begins the\nstory. Right away I feel an ulcer coming on.\nI find it almost inconceivable that after decades of covering commercial\naviation, USA Today would fail to understand there is always a minimum of\n_two_ pilots in the cockpit: a captain and a first officer. The latter is\nknown colloquially as the copilot, but they _both_ are fully qualified pilots.\nThey _both_ perform takeoffs and landings, and _both_ are certified to operate\nthe aircraft in all regimes of flight. A first officer is not an apprentice.\nIn fact, owing to the quirks of the airline seniority system, it is not\nunheard of for the first officer to be older and more experienced than the\ncaptain. More here.\nHow many times have I been through this? I\u2019ve explained it repeatedly in blog\npostings, articles, and in my book. I have no idea how many people have been\nlistening, but in one fell swoop USA Today has misinformed hundreds of\nthousands of readers.\nBut wait, it gets worse\u2026\nLater in the same story we are told that one of the Malaysian investigators\nsaid of the crew, \u201cOnly the captain possessed the experience and expertise to\nfly the plane.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure what disturbs me more: that an accident investigator would say\nsuch a nonsensical and untrue thing, or that USA Today didn\u2019t have the common\nsense to vet it. I can\u2019t believe that nobody on the editorial staff of a paper\nthat runs so many airlines stories, and that caters to travelers, didn\u2019t at\nleast flag this statement for review.\nThe idea that a first officer on a Boeing 777 wouldn\u2019t have the experience or\nexpertise to operate the aircraft on his own is beyond preposterous. Why the\ninvestigator would assert otherwise, if in fact the quote was interpreted\ncorrectly, I have no idea.\nThe details of the Malaysia Airlines mystery have been subject to enough\nmisinterpretation and general media overboiling as it is. This puts things\nover the top, into the realm of total and complete nonsense.\nAnd hang on, there\u2019s more\u2026\nThe same issue of USA Today, on page 10A, features a letter to the editor by a\nman from Minnesota named Tom O\u2019Mara. His topic is the tracking of commercial\nflights. He asks that we \u201cdemand that airlines track all their flights from\ntakeoff to landing.\u201d Five dollars per passenger, he submits, ought to be\ninvested in a \u201ctracking system for commercial flights over the ocean.\u201d\nThe problem here is that commercial flights are tracked over the oceans. Air\ncrews must always be in contact with both air traffic control and company\ndispatchers on the ground. Most intercontinental aircraft have datalink or\nsatellite communications systems that allow for constant real-time tracking.\nOf course, this equipment works only so long as it\u2019s powered. A fire, failure,\nor act of sabotage can render it inoperative \u2014 no different, I would presume,\nfrom any piece of equipment in any application in any industry. Maybe that\u2019s\nO\u2019Mara\u2019s point; possibly he\u2019s arguing for some type of fail-safe tracking\nmechanism that can\u2019t be destroyed or turned off? But he doesn\u2019t say so, and\nthe tone and implication of his letter is simple and clear enough: planes are\nnot tracked.\nWhich is untrue. And here the newspaper again drops the ball, by publishing a\nletter based on a false premise.\n\n\nTHE GRAPHICS ON CNN say \u201cBreaking News\u2026\u201d followed by, \u201cThere is no new\ninformation in the disappearance of flight MH370.\u201d Can\u2019t make this up.\nMalaysian authorities, meanwhile, have put out the blockbuster announcement\nthat they are confident the plane crashed into the sea. Damn, and all this\ntime I believed the jet was hidden away in a hangar somewhere on a \u201cremote\nairstrip.\u201d\nExcept of course that plenty of people really do subscribe to such an idea.\nAnd it\u2019s this conspiracy mongering that\u2019s the most discouraging and\ndistracting aspect of this entire story. How it got there we don\u2019t yet know \u2014\nand we may never know \u2014 but there is an extremely high certainty that the\nplane is in the Indian ocean. This is by far the likeliest possibility, and I\nwish the TV networks would cease and desist from giving further credence to\nnotions of a kidnapping conspiracy. There is zero evidence to support such a\nclaim, and analytically it makes no sense. Some buffoon was on Fox News the\nother night saying, \u201cThis has all the makings of a hostage situation.\u201d\nActually, it has _none_ of the makings of a hostage situation.\nNot that I\u2019m shocked that so many people are willing to accept these ideas.\nWhat is it about our society nowadays that foments such fanciful and illogical\nlines of thinking?\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a bullet-point look at some of the topics and theories we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from the start:\n **TRANSPONDERS** The media has been throwing this term around without a full\nunderstanding of how the equipment works. See my explanation at the top of\nthis post.\n **\u201cALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT\u201d** If I hear one more person attempt to make\nsomething of the first officer\u2019s final words to air traffic control \u2014 \u201call\nright, good night\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to hit the roof. There is _nothing_ unusual\nabout this salutation. While it sounds cryptic in the context of the ongoing\nmystery, it\u2019s a perfectly normal sign-off \u2014 the kind of thing pilots say to\ncontrollers _all the time_.\n **THE RADAR RUSE** I\u2019m talking about this post, by an aviation enthusiast\nnamed Keith Ledgerwood. His hypothesis is that the missing Malaysia Airlines\njet had tucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019\nradar signatures to appear as one. Thus disguised, the Malaysia jet flew on,\nundetected for hours before eventually breaking off and landing at an airfield\nin\u2026? See that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about this idea. It fails to offer any\nexplanation as to how, once separating from the Singapore flight, the Malaysia\njet could have completed its secret diversion without being seen \u2014 to say\nnothing of _why_ such a difficult and elaborate plot would be put in motion to\nbegin with. It makes very little sense, other than it allows an aviation\nhobbyist to show off a little, and provides more fodder for a media starved of\nuseful information. Beyond that, if the Malaysia plane had been directly below\nthe Singapore 777, the latter\u2019s radar altimeter would have shown it. The radar\naltimeter is a device that displays physical distance, in feet, to an object\nbelow. (They differ from a plane\u2019s main altimeters, which reference height\nabove sea level.) In normal operations that object is the ground, but during\ncruise they commonly pick up crossing traffic, momentarily showing planes as\nthey pass beneath. So, ask the Singapore crew: was your radar altimeter\nflashing on and off, showing some sort of object below you?\n **FIRE OR FUMES?** This theory has gotten a ton of attention thanks to a\nWired magazine story penned by a general aviation pilot named Chris\nGoodfellow. He proposes that the flight\u2019s sudden turn off course was a\nresponse to an inflight emergency \u2014 an intentional deviation forced by an\nelectrical or cargo fire. While headed for an emergency landing, the crew was\novercome by smoke or fumes. Its autopilot on and course reprogrammed, the\nplane then continued on for a time before crashing. The theory is described in\nthe headline as \u201cstartlingly simple,\u201d though in fact there\u2019s nothing startling\nabout it, and Goodfellow more or less repeats what _I_ said in a post back on\nMarch 14th. That a fire would be potent enough knock out communications and\nincapacitate the crew, yet not destroy the aircraft very quickly, is certainly\na sticking point, but neither is it impossible.\n **THE TERRORIST PLOT** If indeed this was a hijacking, did the plane land\nsomewhere, as some are suggesting, possibly to be used later as an airborne\nweapon of some kind, perhaps loaded with a nuclear or biological weapon? I\n_seriously_ doubt it. Remote as some airports are, the task of stealing and\nthen secretly landing and hiding a 777 would be exceptionally difficult. But\nmore than that, what sense would it make for a terrorist group steal a\ncommercial jetliner full of passengers from one of the most prestigious\nairlines in the world, guaranteeing that everybody on the planet will be\nlooking for it? There are hundreds or even thousand of cargo planes and\nbusiness jets that move around the world each day more or less anonymously,\nany one of which would do the job equally as well as well, with only a small\nfraction of the attention. That\u2019s not to discount the possibility of a\nhijacking outright, but I can\u2019t imagine the plane actually landed somewhere.\nAs to other motives, remember that the long, long history of air piracy did\nnot begin and end with September 11th, 2001, so it\u2019s important not to view\nevery hijacking through the crucible of the 9/11 template. People hijack\nplanes for different reason. It may even have been a rogue crewmember.\n **REMOTE CONTROL** This one is full-on James Bond. We\u2019re told how the plane\u2019s\n\u201cflight computer,\u201d whatever that is, was hacked, allowing the plane to be\nflown remotely, like a drone, either to crash it into the ocean or carry it to\na secret airstrip somewhere. I\u2019m frustrated by how often this is suggested,\nbecause there is simply no way to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane. People seem to have a vastly exaggerated idea of how modern\njetliners are flown \u2014 that is, they vastly exaggerate the capabilities of\ncockpit automation, and what a person with access to this automation, whether\nfrom inside or outside the plane, would be able to do with it. People read and\nhear things out of context \u2014 simplified explanations and experimental\napplications of technology \u2014 and they extrapolate unrealistically. And it\u2019s\nnot as if the pilots don\u2019t monitor and crosscheck a plane\u2019s progress when its\nautoflight system is engaged. We are constantly doing that. If something were\nmessing with one or more of the system\u2019s modes, we\u2019d know it, and could easily\ndisengage that mode and fly using basic course, altitude, or power commands.\nWorst-case, we can switch the automation off completely and do everything by\nhand.\n **WHY NO PHONE CALLS?** Some have wondered why, assuming the jet was\nhijacked, passengers did not place cell phone calls to loved ones, as occurred\nduring the 9/11 attacks. Does the absence of call records suggest the\npassengers had been incapacitated somehow, or that the plane had met a sudden\nend? No. Unless an aircraft is flying low and within range of a cell tower,\ncellular calling from a plane _does not work_. Your phone _will not_ maintain\na signal. Some airplanes are equipped with special technology that permits\ncalling via satellite or using radio frequencies to transmit cellular calls,\nbut I\u2019m uncertain if Malaysia\u2019s 777s have this technology. Even if they do it\ncould have been intentionally turned off or suffered a power failure, no\ndifferent from the plane\u2019s other communications equipment.\n **THE MISSING MAYDAY** Lack of a mayday call: No matter an aircraft\u2019s\nlocation, the crew is _always_ in contact with both air traffic control and\ncompany ground staff. When flying in remote locations, however, this is often\na more involved process than simply picking up a microphone and talking.\nExactly how it\u2019s done depends on which equipment the plane is fitted with, and\nwhich ATC facility you\u2019re working with. Flying over open ocean, relaying even\na simple message can be a multi-step process transmitted through FMS datalink\nor over high frequency radio. In an emergency, communicating with the ground\nis secondary to dealing with the problems at hand. As the old adage goes: you\naviate, navigate, and communicate \u2014 in that order. And so, the fact that no\nmessages or distress signals were sent by the crew is _not_ surprising or an\nindicator of anything specific.\n **INTO ORBIT** Of the wackier ideas I\u2019ve been hearing, my favorite is the one\nthat goes like this: Would it be possible for the 777 to have climbed clear\nout of the atmosphere, so high that \u201cit disintegrated,\u201d went into orbit, or\notherwise became impossible to track or locate? In normal circumstances I\nwouldn\u2019t burden the rest of you with an answer to such nonsense, except that\nno fewer than _five_ readers already have asked some version of this question.\nThe answer is no. It is totally impossible for that to happen. At a certain\naltitude, a plane\u2019s engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings\nwill no longer provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to\nsustain flight. All commercial passenger jets have maximum certified cruising\naltitudes below 50,000 feet or so. And even this altitude isn\u2019t always\nreachable. The maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight,\nthe air temperature and other factors.\n **HYPOXIA** Could a rapid loss of cabin pressure, perhaps as a result of a\nfire or some other problem, rendered the flight crew, and possibly everyone\nelse on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane continued\non before eventually crashing. This is conceivable, yes (though maybe no more\nso than assorted other scenarios). Depressurizations by themselves are\nperfectly manageable and almost never fatal (see chapter two of my book for a\nstory about the time it happened to me), and something that all airline crews\ntrain for, but only _if_ the crew understands the problem and does what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do. See Helios Airways.\n **THE STOLEN PASSPORTS** Interpol says the Iranians with stolen passports\nwere migrants hoping to be smuggled into Europe. There are thousands of people\njetting around the world on forged or stolen documents, for a variety of shady\nreasons, but that doesn\u2019t make them terrorist bombers.\n **PILOT EXPERIENCE** It\u2019s doubtful this was any factor. The captain of the\nill-fated flight had logged close to 20,000 flight hours, a substantial total\nby any standard. The first officer (copilot), on the other hand, had fewer\nthan three thousand hours to his name. Pilots in North America \u2014 those like\nme, at any rate, who come up through the civilian ranks \u2014 generally accrue\nseveral thousand hours before landing a job with a major airline. We slog our\nway through the industry in a step-by-step process, building experience along\nthe way. Thus it would be unheard of to find a Boeing 777 copilot with such a\nsmall number of hours. In other areas of the world, the process is often\ndifferent. Pilots are frequently selected through so-called ab-initio\nprograms, hand-picked by carriers at a young age and trained from the start to\nfly jetliners. We can debate the perils of this method, but I tend to doubt\nit\u2019s anything more than a side note. Plus, flight hours in and of themselves\naren\u2019t necessarily a good measure of a pilot\u2019s skills or performance under\npressure. And any pilot, regardless of his or her logbook totals, and\nregardless of the airline, needs to meet some pretty rigorous training\nstandards before being signed off to fly a 777.\n\n\nAll we know for sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or\ncommunication from the crew. The culprit could be anything from sabotage to\nfire to a bizarre mechanical problem \u2014 or, as is so common in airline\ncatastrophes, some combination or compounding of human error and/or mechanical\nmalfunction.\nAnd all the while people keep asking \u201chow can a plane simply disappear?\u201d It\u2019s\nan idea that to many makes no sense in an age of instant and total\nconnectivity. But consider: if somebody yanks the power cord out of your\ncomputer, suddenly all the wonderful immediacy and connectivity of the\ninternet is effectively vanished. Similarly, all of the fancy equipment in a\n777\u2019s cockpit is only useful if it\u2019s actually _running_. Thus, together with\nan absence of primary radar over much of the ocean, the idea that a plane can\ndisappear becomes a lot more conceivable.\nAnd no matter who or what is to blame, we shouldn\u2019t let this latest tragedy\novershadow the fact that air travel remains remarkably safe. Worldwide, the\ntrend over the past several years has been one of steady improvement, to the\npoint where last year was the safest in the entire history of commercial\naviation. Hopefully their number continues to diminish, but a certain number\nof accidents will always be inevitable. In some ways, the weirdness of this\nstory speaks to how well we have engineered away what once were the most\ncommon causes of crashes. Those that still occur tend to be more mysterious\nand strange than in decades past (have a look at the year 1985 some time, for\nan idea of how frequent large-scale air disasters once were).\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s fascinating how this story has moved from being one about a\npresumed airplane crash to, really, a _mystery story_. It\u2019s the very missing-\nness of the plane that the public finds so captivating. If and when the\nwreckage is discovered, I have to wonder if suddenly people will stop paying\nsuch rapt attention. If so, that\u2019s too bad, because the question at hand ought\nto be what happened on board the jet, not _where is_ the jet.\nI say \u201cif and when\u201d because I think people need to reconcile with the\npossibility that the plane might _never_ be found. I know that sounds absurd\nin an age where fast and easy answers are taken for granted, but it could very\nwell happen.\n__________\n\n\nMalaysia Airlines was formed in the early 1970s after its predecessor,\nMalaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA), split to become Singapore Airlines and\nMalaysia Airlines.

At this time there are up to 20\npieces of debris that have been found by others. Some are certainly from the\nflight. Some are likely from the flight. Some are possibly from the flight.\nThey range from the flaperon to an angry birds bag. There is an interior\nfuselage closet panel that contained a fold out worktable. There is another\ninterior wall panel that measures only approximately 18\u201d x 18\u201d. A seatback\npanel that is also small and looks like it framed a TV monitor.\nSo the plane hit the water hard and is in many pieces, mostly small.\nOcean Infinity is not likely to find it.

The potential fee rises in\nstaggered amounts to as much as $70 million, depending on how large an area\nthe vessel searches before locating the plane.\nAlthough the wreckage could contain a wealth of information on how the\nairplane crashed, even if it functioned after years deep under water, the\ncockpit voice recorder operates on a loop, and the crucial early part of the\nflight when the aircraft altered course would have been erased.\nOften be put!

[Cue the ominous \u201cBum ba dum bum bum.\u201d music.]\nIn August, Malaysian Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said any\ndecision to resume the search, based on any new data, had to be jointly made\nby Malaysia, Australia and China.\nSo, what it all means is:\n1\\. Captain Shah planned and executed this. Why? I don\u2019t know. It is a very\ntangled web that includes his wife, Freescale Semiconductor, and possibly\nIslamic terrorism.  \n2\\. Malaysia is attempting to ensure that we will never know, by requiring\nAustralia, China and their own country to decide to resume the search.

He was Minister of Finance\nwith the ruling party. He fell out of favor and was arrested and imprisoned on\nquestionable charges of sodomy with a male aide.\nHe was eventually acquitted, but when it became clear he led the opposition\nparty and would likely win the election, his acquittal was overturned and he\nwas returned to prison late in the day on March 7th, 2014.\nMH370 vanished only hours later on March 8th, 2014.\nSo, like Amelia Earhart, this mystery will most likely forever remain just\nthat.

The corporation is accountable to the\ngovernment and the government is the corporation.\nWhen did Captain Shah create that red route on his flight simulator? Surely\nthe file has a date and time stamp. If the date is March 7, 2014, the day\nAnwar Ibrahim was returned to prison, that is the smoking gun. The plane\nvanished hours later.\nThe thing that keeps coming back to me is no normal person would create that\nflight plan in a flight simulator. My imagination leads me to this scenario.\nZaharie Ahmad Shah was politically riled. He was upset that Anwar Ibrahim was\nreturned to prison. He fought with his wife and she left. He was angry at the\nworld. He plotted the flight on his simulator.\nAt the hand-over from Malaysia to China, he asked his first officer to get\nthem some tea. When the co-pilot returned, Captain Shah refused entry. I know\ncockpit doors are reinforced, probably with steel and their is a way to get\nin, if for example the pilot has become incapacitated. So, I imagine it is\nsomebody rings the door bell, person in cockpit presses the button to unlock\nthe door or denies entry. If neither is done in a minute or so, the door is\nunlocked.

As a flight simulator enthusiast, I would\nnever do this because flying for hours over water would be boring, especially\nknowing I had no airport to land at, that I was just going to crash into the\nwater. That is just a waste of time.\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau Says: There is a high degree of\nconfidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date\ndoes not contain the missing aircraft. Given the elimination of this area, the\nexperts identified an area of approximately 25,000 km\u00b2 as the area with the\nhighest probability of containing the wreckage of the aircraft. The experts\nconcluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for\nlocating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be\nexhausted.\nIt is unlikely the ship shall ever be located, but why not fish in the hot\nspot?

Here is another coincidence: Anwar Ibrahim, the former Deputy\nPrime Minister of Malaysia and leader of the opposition party Pakatan Rakyat\nwas in line to become Prime Minister, when he was charged with corruption and\nsodomy and subsequently beaten in jail. He was eventually acquitted and poised\nto become Chief Minister of Selangor state, the economic engine of Kuala\nLumpur. His acquittal was overturned and he was returned to prison on March\n7th, 2014. MH370 disappeared several hours later on March 8th, 2014. Nurul\nIzzah Anwar, Ibrahim\u2019s daughter, said that the link between the pilot of\nmissing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and her father was just coincidental.\nChristine Negroni is promoting her new book in which she postulates that the\naircraft lost cabin pressure at the hand-over point between Malaysia & Vietnam\nATC\u2019s. Of course, there is absolutely zero evidence of this.\nTo Patrick: Of course we all can only speculate. We know the flaperon washed\nashore. It got ripped off by a huge force. It was serrated from it dragging\nacross the water at high velocity. If the entire aircraft, simply banked, with\nthe flaperon retracted, the flaperon would not have been ripped from the wing.\nBilly Idol danced with himself, so I suppose I am entitled to argue with\nmyself. After seeing the photos of the found flaperon and the setting\n(extremely rocky beach,) I now have a different hypothesis for the serrated\ndamage to the trailing edge.\nRather than being serrated by a controlled water-landing, I postulate that\nsince the leading edge has much more volume to hold air, it was upright in the\nwater. As the flaperon bobbed, the trailing edge scraped against the rocky\nshoreline as the waves \u201cbeat it\u201d in and out.\nThis would indicate that the craft hit the water hard and broke apart. I\u2019m\ngetting a headache! Where\u2019s my aspirin and my Pabst Blue Ribbon and Jack?\nNote: Billy Idol and Michael Jackson reference in the same post. Do I get the\n\u201cTotally 80\u2019s Award?\u201d\nI just learned that a week or two after I posted my assertions on the last\nmoments of MH370 on this site, they were confirmed (in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d TV show\nsegment) by Larry Vance.\nVance has over forty-years of experience as a professional pilot, and more\nthan twenty-five years as an accident investigator. He completed over two\nhundred investigations as an Investigator-In-Charge for the Canadian Aviation\nSafety Board (CASB) and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB).\nThree found pieces have now been confirmed as MH370. The flaperon has the\naluminum trailing edge literally \u201ccut\u201d by the water, proving it was extended;\nproving someone \u201chad control\u201d of the airplane.\nThe aircraft is on the floor of the Indian Ocean. It is likely in about a\ndozen major pieces: engines, wings, horizontal stabilizers, flaps and\nfuselage.\nBarring a privately-funded enterprise to locate and retrieve it, that fuselage\nis the final resting place for the bodies of the 239 souls on board.\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that clear. The dynamics of crashes can so vary so much,\ndepending on the plane\u2019s speed, attitude, and so forth. The damage to the\nflaperon COULD suggest it was extended, but couldn\u2019t the damage have been\ncaused in other ways? And the flaperon acts as both a flap and an aileron.\nCould it not have been extended merely by virtue of the wing having been\nbanked?\nWhat do experts other than Vance have to say about this? One person\u2019s opinion\ndoes not \u201cconfirm\u201d anything.\nOn the day this plane crashed I had an extroidinary vision of it. There will\nbe many out there that say I am just another mad woman. I assure you I am not.\nI do have second sight but certainly do not read tea leaves.\nI am saddened and frustrated at all the things I am reading, I know in my\nheart I would never have anything like this in my lifetime ever again. So\nconvinced of it, at the time I passed it to two persons, one of whom was a\nmember of the British press.  \nSo far the visions have come startlingly true as to what I saw and the\nevidence that has been found. If one wanted an explanation I feel sure an\naircraft was passing over my house at the exact moment this one met its fate.\nI would willingly tell all I know in detail, it just might solve this great\nmystery and give these honourable souls the rest and peace they deserve.\nI believe mobile GPS stop working once you exceed a certain speed. Which is\nabove that of a car can manage, but way below that of the cruising speed of a\nB777.\nDon\u2019t take my word for it though, I just recall that from memory.\nhttp://fds9923sdsd.co mnxzc\nExactly what I was looking for, regards for posting.\nThat is exactly what that means.\nI have held from early on this was a rogue pilot who pulled off a water\nlanding. The lack of internal debris like 300 seat cushions, and now proved by\na deployed flaperon at impact. I also knew early on that the Northern Arc was\nfar to North as a rogue pilot would use Long Range Cruise to maximize fuel\nefficiency.\nUnfortunately, the entire investigation ignored these obvious facts and\nassumed the plane crashed shortly after power down at 8:19. This fallacy\nfailed to account for a 30 minute glide covering an additional 100 miles\nbefore the epic water landing was achieved.\nFacts are facts and ignoring obvious reality in order to prove a malfunction\nwasted 2 years and 170 million in cash, look 100 miles to far North.\nIt reappeared in Indiana because Mike Pence is governor and Donald Trump will\nmake America grate again. If there had been no LGBT or foreign passengers then\nPence would have allowed it to land. Then all would be well. But no, we didn\u2019t\nhave a plane full of normal people so see what happened? Only John S\nHattabaugh, Donald Trump, and Mike Pence can make America grate again and\nbring MA370 to a safe landing.\nright after it disappeared it showed up in campbellsburg indiana the sky was\nvoid of all clouds except one i was driving down highway 60 in campbellsburg\nthere was no one behind me or in front of me as far as i could see a cloud\nvery tight and compact with lighting bolts going on constantly inside it\nsticking out of the cloud was a tail and portion of body of passenger jet it\nwas blue with red trim i watched it until i got tired of it knowing they were\ntrapped until the end of this earth the pilot flew right in it because he did\nnot want to dive or take hard left or right and harm passengers he should have\npeople would be hurt but they would be here pilots beware of such things of\nspace and time we know nothing about\nSir,  \nAfter scanning down (only) a small portion of the total comments on  \nthis topic, I note suggested reasons for 9M-MRO disappearance;  \nMalcolm \u2013 remotely controlled by the \u201cuninterruptible\u201d autopilot  \nEagle in NYC \u2013 remotely hijacked by a \u201cRED (=Chinese) Army Gamer\u201d  \nJay \u2013 forced into (outer) space with a new military emp (=EMP)weapon.  \nMay I gently suggest you start applying the DELETE button to such  \nposts you receive, as your blog suffers both in reputation & quality  \nby allowing such idiocy.

But, not at the\nvictims or their families, it was aimed at the goofballs spewing stupid,\nheartless ideas.\nTo B737s: I gather that you are saying that it is impossible for a person to\nplan to commit an incident like this. I simply disagree with you and will move\non to your assertion that if this were to happen in the USA fighter jets would\nrespond. Of course they would. As they did with Payne Stewart\u2019s Learjet. They\nflew up to it and escorted it as it crashed into South Dakota. But, this\ndidn\u2019t happen in Missouri, it happened in between Malaysia & Vietnam on the\nway to China.\nYou state \u201clanding it completely intact is\u2026impossible.\u201d I agree. That is why\nthe lowered flap/aileron ripped off when it contacted those waves. The rest of\nthe ship sunk mostly intact. Mission accomplished.\nThere was no visible debris on the sea.

This plane was intentionally\nwater-landed and sunk intact.\nArt Knight:\n[ The hijacker or pilot of MH370 did this to make it look like an accident.\n\u201cHe\u201d landed the aircraft intending it to remain intact. ]\nMy issue is that \u201cto make it look like an accident\u201d is anything but\u2026 too\nplanned.

If this were to happen over, say the USA, they plane would be\ngreeted with fighter jets immediately and at least some cause would be\nobserved.\nAnd landing it completely intact without it breaking apart is impossible; the\nprevious successful water ditchings involved landing in rivers and are\nnarrowbodies. This is a widebody landing in the choppy seas with 20 + feet\nwaves. The engines act as a big scoop; it will flip upon landing and break up.\nFlyht Aerospace has the answer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkeqgXNbLvo\nB737s says:  \nAugust 3, 2016 at 12:25 am\nArt Knight:\nI\u2019m saying that for someone who wants to purportedly commit suicide/murder,\nthat is an awful lot of work just to leave this world.

There is only one in the cosmos, so no more info is\nrequired. It is nearby where Officer \u201cGI\u201d Joe Gliniewicz served.\nMy sister and niece were stranded on the road for hours during the\ninvestigation and search for the imaginary perpetrators. He was head of the\npolice explorers program and was skimming money for petty things like internet\nporn. Rather than face the impending investigation, he staged an elaborate\nsuicide to look like a murder. HE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE CHEST! Why is is so\ndifficult to believe a pilot could execute a water landing?\nThe hijacker or pilot of MH370 did this to make it look like an accident. \u201cHe\u201d\nlanded the aircraft intending it to remain intact.\nPatrick,\nToday someone posted the following question on Facebook. The question\noriginally appeared in Spanish, followed by an automatic Google-generated\ntranslation.\nI\u2019m really curious to know how you would respond.\nHere is the question:\n\u00bfPorqu\u00e9 los aviones a\u00fan tienen una \u201cCaja Negra\u201d? \u00bfNo es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil enviar las\ngrabaciones a la Nube desde el avi\u00f3n v\u00eda Internet y as\u00ed saber exactamente qu\u00e9\nle sucedi\u00f3 al avi\u00f3n luego que se estrella, para luego concluir, como en el 95%\nde los accidentes a\u00e9reos, que se trat\u00f3 de \u201cError humano\u201d?\nGoogle translation:\nWhy the planes are still a \u201cBlack box\u201d? isn\u2019t it easier to send the recordings\nto the cloud from the plane via the internet and so to know exactly what\nhappened to the plane after crashes, then conclude, as In the 95 % of the air\naccidents, that it was \u201chuman error\u201d?\nWow, never knew about the New Island thing. If so, then might make sense:\neither the simulator has this airport, or someone wants to visit the imaginary\nisland.\nPerhaps a re-investigation, if possible even, of data in computers or printed\nmaterial regarding \u2018New Island\u2019.\nThe one thing the news reports fail to mention when talking about Captain\nShah\u2019s test run to what appears to be an uninhabited part of the Indian Ocean\nis that there is a fake island located there, invented as an internet project.\nhttp://www.newisland.net/p/about-new-island.html\nNormally this wouldn\u2019t matter much but I believe that several flight\nsimulators, including the one Captain Shaw used, have this fake island in\ntheir database. So while an actual flight there would find nothing in the\nflight simulator there is an airport there (and wouldn\u2019t you practice flying\nthere in this case?). We sometimes make the assumption that all aspects of\nvirtual worlds match those of our real and that\u2019s not always the case.\nArt Knight:\nI\u2019m saying that for someone who wants to purportedly commit suicide/murder,\nthat is an awful lot of work just to leave this world. And then even at the\nvery end, instead of nose diving to end it quickly, like most people would\nprobably do, the hijacker guides the plane down to attempt to land it in the\nmiddle of the ocean, just so he could survive the crash to get stranded in the\nmiddle of nowhere and then slowly die of hypothermia/hunger/drowning/etc ?\nTo B737s: What is your point?\nThere is plenty of misinformation, disinformation, fantasies and lies\nregarding this incident. People have been in limbo for over two years, after\nexpecting to meet their loved ones at the airport and drive them home.\nI had my foot crushed at work 2 years ago and I can say the waiting for\ntreatment or justice is gut-wrenching.\nThe stress and pain these people are feeling is very real to me. This is no\nparlor game. So\u2026my question to you is:\n\u201cDo you have anything to say that moves us closer to understanding what\nhappened?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if this moves us any closer to understanding what happened to\nflight 370, but here is my two bits: I said from the very beginning that this\nplane never went down into the ocean. I believe this plane was hijacked for\nthe purpose of using it for some terrorist activity, like 9/11. I think when\nthis plane was off the point of western Sumatra it turned around and flew low\nback to the Malaysia peninsula and landed, and hidden. As for the passengers\nthey are either being held or they have been murdered. The parts of aircraft\nfound washed up on shores could have been ripped off the plane and dumped at\nsea to make people think the plane crashed at sea. It is highly unlikely that\nno floating debris would have not escaped the plane. All the other scenarios\ngiven for 370 disappearance do not make sense.\nI appreciate the comment, Phillip, and thanks for reading. But, I respectfully\ndisagree with your contentions.\n\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if this moves us any closer to understanding what happened to\nflight 370, but here is my two bits: I said from the very beginning that this\nplane never went down into the ocean. I believe this plane was hijacked for\nthe purpose of using it for some terrorist activity, like 9/11\u2026\u201d\nAs I say in the story, why would you NEED to steal a plane full of people,\nfrom one of Asia\u2019s most prestigious airlines, thus guaranteeing that everybody\non earth will be looking for you? There are jets all over the world that could\nbe quietly and easily acquired for this purpose: old freighters, airliners in\nstorage, business jets, etc. This makes no sense.\n\u201c\u2026I think when this plane was off the point of western Sumatra it turned\naround and flew low back to the Malaysia peninsula and landed, and hidden\u2026\u201d\nHow do you \u201chide\u201d a 777? Where? And by whom, exactly?\n\u201c\u2026As for the passengers they are either being held or they have been murdered.\nThe parts of aircraft found washed up on shores could have been ripped off the\nplane and dumped at sea to make people think the plane crashed at sea\u2026\u201d\nWhat\u2019s this now? So, you \u201crip off\u201d the plane\u2019s flying controls and toss them\ninto the ocean, in the hopes that many months later somebody _might_ find\nthem? This is starting to make my brain hurt.\n\u201c\u2026All the other scenarios given for 370 disappearance do not make sense\u2026\u201d\nActually they _do_ make sense. They make substantially _more_ sense than what\nis suggested here.\nSir, I am sorry, but I remain unconvinced. I said before that none of these\nscenarios make sense, and I still believe that. Take the one about the pilots\nforgetting to put on their oxygen mask, Now really, give me a break. A pilot\nwith, what was it, 20,000 hours of fight time and highly trained, and these\nguys are going to forget to put on their oxygen mask. I don\u2019t believe that.\nThen there is the case of the \u201cprogrammed routing\u201d. Now I am not a pilot, I\nhave never flown a plane in my life, so you will have to help me on this one.\nBut wouldn\u2019t the plane be programmed to fly to Beijing? If the plane flew to\nthe Indian Ocean, which I do not believe, would it not have to be re-\nprogrammed to do so? You say \u201cwhat is it about our society nowadays that\nfoments such fanciful and illogical lines of thinking.\u201d Radicalized Arab\nterrorist are not something that is fanciful, it happens to be true. This\nthing about flying this plane down into the Indian Ocean has got so many\npeople thinking this way that they can not think logically. What I look for is\nwhat makes sense, and what does not make sense. Unfortunately I have used up\nmy allotment of words, and there is so much more that needs to be said.\n\u201c\u2026I remain unconvinced. I said before that none of these scenarios make sense,\nand I still believe that\u2026\u201d\nExcept they _do_ make sense. There are a few different scenarios in play, from\nthe depressurization theory to the pilot murder/suicide theory, and they are\neach very plausible.\n\u201c\u2026Take the one about the pilots forgetting to put on their oxygen mask, Now\nreally, give me a break. A pilot with, what was it, 20,000 hours of fight time\nand highly trained, and these guys are going to forget to put on their oxygen\nmask. I don\u2019t believe that\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that simple. Even very experienced pilots could potentially be\ncomplacent about getting their masks on, especially if the malfunction is\ngradual or misunderstood initially. See Payne Stewart, Helios Air, etc. It\u2019s\nalso possible that, as part of the emergency, the crew oxygen supply itself\ncould have exploded or malfunctioned, as happened on a Qantas 747 once.\n\u201c\u2026Then there is the case of the programmed routing. Now I am not a pilot, I\nhave never flown a plane in my life, so you will have to help me on this one.\nBut wouldn\u2019t the plane be programmed to fly to Beijing?\u2026\u201d\nNot really. Planes are not \u201cprogrammed\u201d in the sense that you are thinking.\nThe routings that are entered into the FMS prior to flight are a long, long\nseries of waypoints, approach and departure patterns, altitudes and speeds,\nall tentative and very much subject to change. There\u2019s a basic, skeletal route\nthat goes in prior to departure, but there will be LOTS of changes to that\ntemplate once the flight is underway, all of them manually entered. Meanwhile\nall it takes is a simple button push \u2014 a reversion to \u201cheading select\u201d mode or\nsome such, to allow a pilot to manually intervene and interrupt the FMS-guided\nroute. This happens MANY times over the course of any flight.\nThe idea of a fully loaded big twin B777 landing INTACT in the ocean after the\nengines go out \u2013 possibly with waves over 20 feet tall, in the pitch darkness\nwithout breaking up..\n..which is after going into \u2018stealth mode\u2019 aka transponder and whatnots going\nsilent and the captain laying low and showing casual personality without\nraising any alarms prior to the flight (as compared to, say, the very well\ndocumented German Wings case)\n\u2026 to plotting a complete route in his head without any other evidence \u2013\nsimulator aside \u2013 and then succeeding in the plan completely, 100%. I mean, I\ncan\u2019t even plan a trip to the mall without something unexpected happening.\nYeah this Captain Zahari (the no.1 suspect as pointed out by most media) is\nturning out to be quite superhuman.\nAnd the simulator.. I have a flight simulator in my computer too, and if you\nlooked at what I did with it, I think I\u2019d be in jail now.\nAm I the only one that thought that the moment they found out the First\nOfficer lets people into the cockpit, the list of people who were possibly\nhijacking the plane have gone from the 2 in the cockpit to the complete 200+\nin whole plane? I mean this news came after 911 obviously and Malaysia\nAirlines afaik had a policy of not letting people into the cockpits as well\nprior to that bit of information\u2026\nYes, I\u2019m skeptical of all these things. Not that I am defending the captain or\nall these theories\u2026 they may be what happened exactly, just as equally they\nmay not..\nThat\u2019s such a sad, sad image to me: a plane full of unconscious people flying\naimlessly through the sky only to eventually stall and descend down into the\nwater. It\u2019s just tragic.\nPatrick, the 777\u2019s crew oxygen cylinder is located in the main equipment\ncenter just below the hatch into the forward cabin. It is well aft of the\nelectronics racks under the flight deck.\nThe 777 has a single 115 cu ft crew oxygen cylinder as basic, with an option\nfor a second one. Only Boeing can tell you if MAS selected the second cylinder\nfor the 777-200ER\u2019s. If so, that may not support your theory of no crew oxygen\nafter a single cylinder failure. If MAS only had a single cylinder, then your\ntheory bears further investigation.\nNote also that some airlines install an 11 cu ft portable oxygen bottle and\nmask on the aft wall of the flight deck. If the crew realized what had\nhappened, they could have grabbed the portable bottle. [There are also\nportable bottles in the cabin, usually near each entry door].\nIf there are 777\u2019s in the desert ready to be scrapped, one of the derelicts\ncould be used to test your theory \u2013 set up a 6 psi differential pressure in\nthe cabin and explode the cylinder, then see which electronics in the main\nequipment center remain intact.\nArg, The below to Art Knight was sent by me.\nReply to Art Knight (just is case this ends up at the top)\nI certainly don\u2019t believe the theory, I just find it the most entertaining. I\nimmediately had the vision of \u201c20 employees of Freescale Semiconductor\u201d\ngetting drunk, turning the plane invisible and then passing out. The rest of\nthe conspiracy theories were just dull normal tripe.\nIf we can find someone to replace Leslie Nielsen, it would be a fine subplot\nto Airplane 3 \ud83d\ude42\nUmm, that was in reply to Robert Patry, not to this article as a whole. The\n\u201cReply\u201d function needs to be adjusted (for example, this was created by\nclicking :Reply\u201d to my comment, which I assume now appears below this one).\nI think a sudden and unexpected Coronal Mass Ejection will take care of you\n*and* your theory.\nNot to beat a dead horse, but someone (pilot or hijacker) intentionally flew\nthis plane for hours and performed a \u201cwater landing.\u201d That is why the flaperon\nripped off. It was extended when the aircraft contacted the water. Conversely,\nPayne Stewart\u2019s Learjet crashed due to hypoxia. The pressurization valve was\nfound in the off position and the flaps were up.\nMy comment was in reply to Daniel Ullman; not sure why it ended up at the top\nof the page. Point being, the plane is in the ocean. David Copperfield or\nFreescale didn\u2019t turn it invisible. My father designed antenna and radar\ncountermeasure for the B-2 \u201cSpirit\u201d Stealth Bomber. That is as \u201cinvisible\u201d as\nairplanes get.\nSo somebody just placed a flaperon on the beach?\nWhen content material technique is concentrated on longer key phrases, your\nrank quickly rise on Google because there is less  \ncompetitors.\nWhile I am not part of the \u201cit a conspiracy!\u201d gang, I think that flight 370 is\nunique for being the first commercial aircraft simply not found since the\nstart of the jet age.\nBtw, the conspiracy theory that I want to be true is this one:  \n\u201cAccording to reports, 20 employees of Freescale Semiconductor, a company that\ndevelops \u201ccloaking\u201d technology were onboard the MH370 when it went missing.\nSome, such as the writers of WorthyToShare, have speculated that the plane may\nhave been turned invisible and landed somewhere, possibly at the US Air Force\nbase in Diego Garcia.\u201d If nothing else, it would make for a damn fine movie.\nUnbelievable. Of course it was manned and crash landed. THE LACK OF DEBRIS IS\nA STRONG INDICATOR! The 777 glides better than any other commercial aircraft.\nThe plane landed mostly intact and was scuttled. Some very smart people can be\nso dumb. It is near the Southern end of the search area and a lot of time and\nmoney was spent figuring out where it is not. If you want to find a rogue\npilot intent on hiding a 777, think like a rogue pilot. One who killed 270\npeople and had a plan. Let see if the search continues. I hope it does.\nThe question is, is there enough power to lower the flaps after a 30 minute\nglide. I suspect the answer is yes. He had plenty of power from air ram to\ndescend. I would have saved fuel by killing engines just before fuel ran out\nand restarted to slow the final impact. It is possible he suspected powering\nup would identify his final location.\nAfter 2 years, of pondering this, I must conclude that this was an intentional\nact.\nI know lightning strikes the same person a few times and people win the\nlottery more than once, but losing all identification systems that a pilot\nwould know about at exactly the hand-over point between Malaysia & Vietnam\nATC\u2019s (where a plane can go off-radar for longer without being missed) is an\namazing coincidence.\nI am not accusing the pilots, but respected people have done weird things.\nJust in my area, John Gacy was a respected member of the community.

The GPS can report position and altitude every second or\nminute and so, and that GPS can have is own power ind\u00e9pendant from the main\ncircuit,can\u2019t be turn off even with a major electrical faillure and still\ntransmit its position even after a crash like an ELT with the exception that a\nrecord is keep of it.  \nThe search would only have to go to the end of the tracking of the GPS and the\nplane would be right there.  \nIt is unbelivable to see all the trucking company utilising this method of\ntracking to know in real time where those trucks are at all time , and we dont\nuse it for airplane.  \nAnd this GPS should not be accessible from inside the plane, and should not be\npossible to be turn off in flight, and no one on board should know where that\nGPS is installed.\nhi, i have found what looks like MH370 and have posted photos all over the\nworld, but nobody cares or wants to know that i have found it and a huge\ndebris field all around it for miles, it has still crossed the 8th ark but on\nthe opposite side of the indian ocean, its on its back and you can see that\nthe right flapper is missing, i found it north east of la reunion island,\nabout 800 to a 1000 mile away, if you go to my face book page i can share my\nphotos with you or go to google earth date 27.3.2014 and zoom into the islands\nto the northeast where you will find what looks like half a volcanic island,\nnow if you have the correct date you can see a huge debris field to the\nnortheast if you go to the top centre outer edge of the area shown above this\nisland you should be able to see the aircraft in the water. if you had a photo\nsection i would send you a pic of it, the pilot was a huge fan of radio\ncontrolled planes i recon he sent a decoy plane or jet (radio controlled) from\nthe plane towards Australia and they tracked it not MH370 which was bunny\nhopping from island to island so not to be tracked then belly flopped into the\nocean and flipping onto its back\u2026..thanks peter\nI intergrated Google flight planner with the app. I Basically linked Google\nflight to Facebook and FLIGHTAWARE app/website ,Enabling people to track\nFamily AND facebook friends Flight .\nHere is The LINK\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.del.eval.android.arrivals4flightaware\nPatrick, great discussion, helps so much in understanding the tragedy and\npossible causes.

What else are you lying about Patrick?\nCannot believe anything in this article sorry. Terribly bad Patrick Smith. One\nday the truth will come out.\nLook, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Do you fly planes for a\nliving? Do you have any realistic sense of how planes are flown, or what\npilots do? No, I didn\u2019t think so. It took me many years to become an airline\npilot. It\u2019s a job that I enjoy and one that I take seriously, and it\u2019s\ninfuriating to hear know-it-all people like you claiming that I\u2019m wrong, or\nthat I\u2019m lying.\nWhat is it about aviation that makes it so tempting for people with absolutely\nno expertise in the subject to mouth off so confidently? I hear it all the\ntime.\nBoeing\u2019s press release (and the patents they hold) are for conceptual things,\nnot actual working products. There is not a commercial jetliner anywhere in\nthe world that can be flown by remote control. Not even close.\nHere, for starters, please read this, and then we can continue arguing\u2026\nhttps://www.askthepilot.com/pilotless-planes/\nMalcolm-\nAnd others concerning remote piloting, technically, yes it\u2019s possible to\ndesign a system so a \u201cfly-by-wire\u201d aircraft such as a triple seven could be\nflown remotely. Boeing has patents for such technology. However, to my\nknowledge there is no commercial airline in the world currently employing this\ntechnology.\nSo, as a viable theory? No. MH370 didn\u2019t have such technology. Technically, it\nmight be theoretically possible for someone to take semi remote control of the\naircraft while onboard and not in the cockpit, at least for fly-by-wire\naircraft, but to my knowledge this has never been done, and would require\nintimate knowledge of the avionics and other computer systems on that specific\ntriple seven.\nKISS- keep it simple stupid, or Occam\u2019s Razor, if you prefer.

Mystery will mystery.\nI find the passenger list more fascinating than the dissapearance. Patent went\nto who?\n[\u2026] Related Story: THE MALAYSIA AIRLINES MYSTERY [\u2026]\nHey patrick-  \nI saw the NOVA episode on MH370 a week back, and it got me thinking about\nscenarios. I have not seen this proposed: Bad guys take the plane and use the\nthreat of killing the passengers to secure the cooperation of the crew. They\ntell the captain to turn off transponders so he does. They direct him to\nchange course so he does. The captain complies until he comes to the\nconclusion that they intend to use the plane as a bomb, killing everyone on\nboard anyway. By this time they are back across Malaysia. At this point he\ndecides he must try to prevent a bigger tragedy, so he takes one farewell look\nat his home, sets the autopilot to turn out to sea, blips the transponder to\nleave a breadcrumb, and depressurizes the cabin, rendering all on board\nunconscious and eventually killing everyone. The plane then flies until it\nruns out of fuel and crashes. And is it likely that one engine quits and the\nplane spirals into a steep dive like the mathematician simulated, with minimal\ndebris? Just thought I would share as I have not seen this anywhere. Thanks\nfor listening.  \nGary\n370 was forced into space with a new military emp weapon. It will never be\nfound as it is a part of the millions of pieces of space debris now\nThe theory of ditching into ocean worries me because a plane that big would\nleave a debris field. With the best search and rescue teams we would know\nsomething by now. Start looking on land. Look at satellites pictures from that\ntime frame for explosions over land.\nThis is something I\u2019ve wondered about. What if the satellite tracking was\nwrong, and the plane is buried in a jungle somewhere, or in the Himalayas? A\ncrash in such a place could leave a very small footprint and could easily be\nmissed.\nHi Patrick, love the blog and your book. Since you\u2019re not a doctor I know this\nis outside your area of expertise, but I have a question about hypoxia being\nat the root of all this. Hypoxia fits well with the behavior of the aircraft\nafter making that big turn off of it\u2019s filed flight path and it seems like\nthis is becoming the most commonly cited theory. However this still leaves the\nodd change of course that was observed at the same time radio communication\nwith the ground ends- which seems like very purposeful action.\nCould hypoxia also explain the diversion? I\u2019ve heard that hypoxia can induce a\nsort of dreamlike stupor before loss of consciousness. Is it possible that one\nor both of the pilots, in such a state, became confused and altered course? Or\nperhaps one pilot became confused and altered course and the other pilot was\ntoo out of it to notice something was wrong? You mentioned you had an\nexperience with hypoxia and I\u2019m guessing that pilots are trained to recognize\nthe symptoms, so I was just wondering if this jibes with your own experiences\n/ knowledge. Thanks!\nA mystery indeed\u2026 and if they do find Malaysia 370, look underneath \u2013 could\nthat be Amelia Earhart\u2019s missing plane? A very insightful read, and like you I\nam amazed at the level of mis-information that is to be had about this\nunfortunate incident.\nStill no admission that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was remotely flown to a\nsecret Red Army air base in China after the Red Army \u201cgamer\u201d the pilot met\nonline was given control over the plane and then promptly killed everyone\nincluding the pilot by rocketing it up to 45,000 feet and then back down to\nbelow radar? (Intentionally killing everyone onboard because the remote\n\u201cgamer\u201d controlling the plane was obviously unaffected by the maneuver.)\nThe Chinese are building secret airstrips on disputed islands or they could\nhave easily flown it to a secret base inland. They had the fuel to fly the\nplane to Beijing, plus the safety cushion.\nIn a few years the Chinese will \u201cinexplicably\u201d mass produce accurate knockoffs\nof the Boeing 777, like they have every previous Western plane, as the Soviets\ndid before them.\nAnd the Chinese stole the 777 for what reason, exactly?\n>>> In a few years the Chinese will \u201cinexplicably\u201d mass produce accurate\nknockoffs of the Boeing 777, like they have every previous Western plane, as\nthe Soviets did before them. <<< The Chinese have produced virtually no large\ncommercial jetliners of their own, ever, knockoffs or otherwise. What are you\ntalking about? In any case, the several Chinese airlines, including Air China\nand China Southern, operate their own fleets of 777s. Why would they need to\nsteal one from Malaysia?\nWhat\u2019s up to every one, it\u2019s in fact a good for me to pay a quick visit this\nsite, it consists of  \nhelpful Information.\nThe pilot had a private flight-simulator to practice flying the airplane into\na volcano never to be found and create the greatest mystery of flight.\nNo one seems to want to address the Avionics compartment on that plane , Seems\nthat is the key to making it disapear and prehaps the hiding place if indeed\nit could be a take over frome below..\nThis might sound crazy but with so much corruption in today\u2019s world. I think\nit could happen. Either one or both pilots could be in on it. Pilot flies\nplane to high altitude purposely causing hypoxia while they or just him wore\nan oxygen mask. After transponders are off, they fly to some 3rd world country\nto sell the plane. There are more corrupt people in this world than terrorist.\nThe cost of a Boeing 777-er200 is 269 million.\nVery interesting web site, as an aviation industry professional (Engineer and\nPPL some heavy time and still work in aviation) I have only one comment, it is\nan aeroplane, aircraft or if a US American then Airplane. A \u201cPlane\u201d is what\nCarpenters and Joiners use to shave wood, its very solid, quite heavy and\ndefinitely doesn\u2019t fly! \ud83d\ude42 As for MH370, I would go 100% with your theories, I\nwont jest about this either, a lot of innocent people died on that flight and\nour responsibility is to find out what happened and prevent it happening\nagain.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight \u2026 \u2013 Transponders, Conspiracy\nTheories, Rogue Pilots and Media Madness: A Continuing Series on the\nDisappearance of the Malaysia Airlines 777. UPDATE: June 26, 2014\u2026 [\u2026]\nI\u2019m surprised to read Mr. Smith suggesting that hypoxia might have been a\ncause of the accident. Of course, Mr. Smith is an airline pilot and I am not.\nBut this layman doesn\u2019t understand how hypoxia could possibly be the cause of\nthe loss of MH 370.\nWe know the transponder was turned off at 01:21 local time. (Incidentally, I\nalso do not understand Mr. Smith\u2019s comments in this article to the effect that\nturning the transponder off didn\u2019t matter because the plane was over open\nwater\u2013the plane was within radar range of both Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh\nand was being tracked by radar in both places until the transponder was turned\noff. So it would certainly seem that turning the transponder off did matter.)\nHypoxia would not turn the transponder off.\nFurthermore, we know via other data that the plane made at least three turns.\nMilitary radar indicates that the plane turned sharply, reversing course and\nflying over the Malay Peninsula. Then, after crossing the peninsula, it turned\nfrom a southwesterly direction to a northwesterly direction. The second leg of\nthe flight, after the sharp turn to the southwest, would have taken the plane\nover the island of Sumatra, but the second turn to the northwest direction\navoided the island of Sumatra, instead following the Strait of Malacca to the\nAndaman Sea. The last radar contact shows the plane headed in that\nnorthwesterly direction, but we know that the plane must have made a third\nturn at some point after that, because the satellite data shows the flight\nended in the southern Indian Ocean, far south of where the plane was last\nspotted on radar.\nHow does the hypoxia theory account for those facts? How does hypoxia account\nfor the transponder being turned off? How does hypoxia account for the plane\nsharply deviating from its flight path and taking three turns? How does any\ncause other than human action explain the plane making three turns?\nAnd beyond the fact that it\u2019s hard to imagine anything other than human\naction, does not the timeline rather strongly suggest that human action caused\nthe disappearance of the plane? The goodbye between Kuala Lumpur and the\nplane, which was anticipated and routine, took place at 0119 local time.\nExactly two minutes after that, at 0121, the transponder was turned off. At\n0125, just four minutes after the transponder was turned off, the plane made\nits turn. Turning the transponder off and making turns strongly indicates that\nsomeone was flying the plane and directing it to make those turns. The fact\nthat the transponder was turned off two mintes after Kuala Lumpur said\ngoodbye, and the plane turned four minutes after that, suggests that someone\non the plane was waiting for the signoff of Kuala Lumpur before turning off\nthe transponder and turning the plane.\nThat would have to be one or both of the pilots, would it not? And we have\nreports that Captain Shah\u2019s wife had left him immediately before the flight.\nWhat we know indicates that it\u2019s more likely than not that one or both of the\npilots intentionally flew the plane into the ocean. Maybe he/they deliberately\nselected someplace far from land in deep water where the plane would never be\nfound.\nAnyway, I\u2019d like to hear Mr. Smith\u2019s theory on how, if hypoxia were the cause\nof the accident, the transponder was turned off and the plane made three sharp\nturns. Or if there\u2019s any conceivable cause other than deliberate human action\nfor the transponder to be turned off and the plane to make three turns.\nWell,yeah, I can just hear the conversation on that plane between the pilot\nand co-pilot:  \nPilot: \u201cYa know, my wife just left me, and I really feel bad about it, I think\nI would like to commit suicide by flying this aircraft into the sea.\u201d  \nCo-pilot: \u201cIt\u2019s really that bad eh?\u201d  \nPilot: \u201cYeah, sure is, but we can put this thing on auto pilot and it will be\na long time before it runs out of fuel, and we can spend the time reminiscing\nabout old times. Are you with me on this?\u201d  \nCo-pilot: \u201cWell hell yeah, anything for an old buddy!\u201d\nYou know what, I really don\u2019t think so!\nPilot cabins can be locked. Either the pilot that crashed the plane killed the\nother pilot, or he waited for the other pilot to exit the cabin and then\nlocked the door.\nI couldn\u2019t refrain from commenting. Perfectly written!\nThe pundits are at it again: this time, a YouTube video led to the\n\u201cProfessional hijacking\u201d of MH370 (http://tinyurl.com/mhmhc8o).\nSo, suddenly \u201cThe captain did it\u201d theory is out the broken window at 36,000\nfeet below the surface of the Indian Ocean.\nI see. It was an \u201cultra-professional hi-tech hijacking never before witnessed\nin history, because, you see, some National Geographic special stupidly gave a\ngrand tour of the instrument bay hidden beneath the flight deck.\u201d\nOkay, fine. The captain DIDN\u2019T do it. Some incredibly talented hijacker \u2014\nunnamed, of course \u2014 managed to perform all these activities, only about 99%\nof which a trained 777 captain with years of experience would have known about\n\u2014 but remember, this hijacker gets a lot of his information from a video on\nTV, never ever having actually had the experience of infiltrating an ACTUAL\ninstrument bay during passenger flight, escaping the notice of everyone on\nboard \u2014 and hijacks MH370.\nThen he cunningly plots it to crash into one of the most inaccessible places\non the planet! And leaves no message behind, no reasons for doing so, is not\none of the passengers aboard who have been scrutinized to the Nth detail on\nbackground etc. \u2014 no, he somehow escaped all THAT business \u2014 yet he manages to\npull off the hijack of all time, because it surely would have to qualify for\nthat distinction \u2014 for ABSOLUTELY NO HUMANLY DISCERNIBLE REASON.\nHumanity amazes me. PEOPLE ARE SO UNREMITTINGLY DUMB. How the FUCK did we ever\nget to the top of the food chain?????\nHere is my thought on this, does anyone else recall, that the Malaysian\npresident actually at the beginning of this whole story, that he called the\nU.S, to take a look at their radar, now if the malaysian are so worried about\ntheir security by revealing what they can see, why! would they call the\nstates, only because on this particular matter something very unusual occured,\nan most countries who are neutral to the U.S would be obligated to tell them,\nfirst before going public. I won\u2019t theorize on what happened, but let\u2019s\nremember the lies they said as well as trying to blame the pilots, now today I\nread, the radar controller fell asleep, they are trying real hard, to get away\nfrom this, so now it\u2019s the controller fault. your right Donald Cricks,{ we are\nnot stupid} lets see what other excuses they make.what we need is a true\nindependant investigator an that person is out there, normal just like you an\nI, but maybe there is a new to be born Sherlock out there, who does not work\nfor any type of government. wish I had the time or resources to do so, but I\ndon\u2019t, what I do believe is capturing the first words an comments made at the\nbeginning of this story, by the Malaysian president. They have their own techs\nwho can read radar an repair, but they called the states, to look at\nit.????????\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nEasy way to join the illuminati brotherhood in the world.Kindly contact ( Mr\nRONY ) the illuminati online registration officer in USA through their email\nnow: illuminatiworldoffirm@gmail.com and you shall be given an idea chance to\nvisit the satan and his representative after registrations is completed by\nyou,no sacrifice of human life needed,illuminati brotherhood brings along\nwealth and famous in life,you have a full access to eradicate(eliminate\n)poverty away from your life now.So contact ( Mr RONY ) hook the online\nregister @:illuminatiworldoffirm@gmail .\nIf some one needs expert view concerning blogging and site-building after that  \ni advise him/her to pay a visit this blog,  \nKeep up the nice job.\nPlease read the linked tweet, which links to an open letter to MH370\ninvestigators.\nAnd share with others, if it resonates with you.\nThanks in advance.\nhttps://twitter.com/Brock_McEwen/status/514791229834272768\nDo you mind if I quote a couple of your articles as long as I  \nprovide credit and sources back to your webpage?  \nMy blog site is in the exact same niche as yours and my users would really\nbenefit from a  \nlot of the information you provide here.

This is not the reason\nfor my letter. In the early 1990\u2019s when I was discharged from the US Navy, I\nwent to work for an Airline Catering Company out of Boston, MA / Logan\nInternational call \u201cMarriott in-flite Services. My job position was to cater\ncommercial airlines. Later I was promoted to Airline Coordinator and my duties\nwere to check and inspect that all catering items were aboard the Aircraft\nbefore departure. My focus was the 5 Trans-Atlantic Flight from BOS-LGA;\n747-200, BOS-GLA, BOS-AMS, BOS-CDG, BOS-AMS and BOS-FRA: all DC-10-40\nAircraft. I also catered 767\u2019s, The SST Concorde, Airbus 340, 747-400\u2019s et al.\nthe DC-10 in comparison to B-777 is a pretty good comparison. NWA Flew 38\nFirst and 256 Y Class PAX with a Crew of 12-15. Now I am thinking of all the\nequipment, Lermer carts and trays, Plastic cups, foam cups, stir sticks,\nnapkins, ovens, plastic food ware, cardboard boxes, duty free items, half\nfilled liquor bottles will float along with all the other aircraft equipment.\nNow with all that equipment and galley nomenclature; investigators and\nsearches haven\u2019t even found a G-Damn Bloody STYROFOAM CUP! Not one cup, cart,\nnapkin, tray liner, plastic flatware has washed up anywhere. NOT ONE has\nwashed up on an Aussie or Kiwi Beach, or countries in the Northern IO. I mean\nWTF? There are literally thousands of cups on these planes. My theory, one of\nthe flight crew got the other out of the cockpit to check something\u2026perhaps in\nAvionics that required him to leave the flight deck. When one pilot leaves the\nflight deck, the other has to go on O2, just in case. Well the just in case\nhappened. I believe the Captain, got the FO to leave the cockpit under the\nauspices of checking something; anything. he Then get out of his chair, locks\nand bolts or barricades the Enhanced since 9-11 cockpit door, Jumps back in\nthe left seat, goes on O2, begins to depressurize the A/C and climbs up to\nover 40K for a few. Maybe some Pax and the FO figure there is a problem and\nbegin to pond on the door wearing a portable mask unless he disabled those\nbefore leaving Penang.he was first on board. He does some wild maneuvers down\nto 20K and then back up and leaves the A/C depress for 30 minutes. He is then\nsatisfied everyone\u2019s dead and during that time he is punching in his waypoints\nin his FMS. Killing the IFF and if I were any of those countries around\nMalaysia I would invest into better anti aircraft radar because nobody noticed\nthe gigantic commercial airline flying low over at least 5 countries or near\nthem and air defenses saw nothing. He then flew out to, God knows where. I\nthink he went to somewhere. I know it was the Captain in my heart. It was\nreleased that he was a meticulous date and time keeper and was very anal about\nbeing at appointments on time, He wrote everything down. His datebook,\nCalendars on the fridge\u2026everywhere. It\u2019s very strange that the days\nimmediately following his last flight to Beijing. He either cancelled or made\nno appointments for after that flight. He wrote nothing down and had no\nappointments. This fact. It has been confirmed. And there is your smoking gun.\nThe only reason is why he did it; and why not one friggin\u2019 Styrofoam cup has\nwashed up anywhere!  \nAnthony Gennaro\nAnthony\nJust FYI, I am so completely in agreement with your hypothesis that I just\ncannot believe that this thing could be perceived as happening in any other\nway. It really helps that, since I seem to have been barking into the wind\nsince about a week after this happened and this is the theory I came up with,\nNO ONE has seen fit to agree that this is the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO EXPLAIN\nwhat happened to MH370.\nWell, one quickie book, but let me tell you, perhaps not EVERY hypothesis that\nwas proposed may have happened the way they say it happened \u2014 same for your\nhypothesis, and mine \u2014 but BASICALLY that is the only possible way MH370\ndisappeared \u2014 I\u2019m really glad I have a sane ally with actual experience in the\nbusiness to back up what to me seems to be a completely ignored \u201cAccount of\nEvents,\u201d even by the numerous talking heads and \u201cindustry pundits\u201d that have\nsprung from their boxes, heads on springs and clown hats firmly glued on, to\ndebate these ludicrous \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that to me, and now obviously to at least\none other sane person, YOU, are so ridiculous as to be in the same genre with\nlittle green men and flying saucers.\nTo me, there is no \u201cmystery\u201d about what happened to MH370: the pilot, for\nwhatever reasons, brought the fucking thing down, finis, finito, \u201cpoint,\u201d full\nstop, period.\nI just cannot WAIT for that bloody black box to be found that is going to\nprove everything you and I have just said.\nThe story goes that the Captain\u2019s wife had left him and that he was somewhat\nupset\u2026.. One of the many problems with the steel flight deck door is that it\nwould be all too easy to lock out everyone, including the other pilot if/when\nhe leaves the flight-deck for a \u201ccomfort break\u201d or whatever. It would have\nbeen easy enough to depressurise the a/c while the remaining pilot used his\noxygen mask until the drop-out system ran out. (Alternatively he could have\nleft everyone conscious, but helpless.*) Repressurise and fly on until either\nthe fuel ran out for a glide approach, or he decided to do a controlled\nditching when he felt he had gone far enough. As we saw in the Hudson river\nevent, the aircraft did not break up, apart from an engine detaching. I reckon\nthat this is a likely scenario, and if correct, and the aircraft sank intact,\nthere would be no wreckage to find. The prospect of there being a, possibly,\nnever solved mystery might well have appealed to someone whose balance of mind\nwas disturbed. For me this is the only scenario that fits the bill\u2026..  \n(*I think that he would have killed those in the cabin in case they might\nmanage to evacuate the a/c.)\nThe new search area makes more sense. I posted earlier that I ran this four\ntimes on a flight simulator. All of the times were within 10 minutes of actual\ntimes all the way to exiting the coast off Thailand. After rounding the\nnorthern tip of Indo, you had to fly at just above stall speed at 360 knots at\n37000 feet. I will rerun at 400 knots and see where I end up at the time of\ncrash. It is likely the pilot picked this location due to calm seas. I base\nthis on the idea the plane is intact at the bottom of the ocean. There is no\nother reason to come back towards Australia.\nDude, how are you coming up with these stall speed numbers? 360 knots? 400\nknots? No commercial jet flies at anything close to (indicated) speeds like\nthose.\nNot that the general assertion of your comment is unreasonable: It is possible\nthat one of the pilots carefully ditched the aircraft, keeping it more or less\nintact in the process.\nA Boeing 777 at 36000 feet will almost certainly want to stall at 350 kts. I\nreran the simulation based on the new search area flying heading 170 off of\nIndo at 450 Kts at 36000 feet. I had to turn to heading 185 for the final 45\nminutes to stay around longitude 100. Engines were killed at 8:10 am and crash\noccurred at 8:34 am at E 100.52 S 29.1. I was approximately 796 miles West\nNorth West of Perth. This seems to coincide almost exactly with the search\narea. It also makes sense the Pilot would be running closer to cruise speed\nrather than just above a stall speed for four hours of flight.\nCommercial planes don\u2019t fly anywhere close to 350 knots (indicated airspeed)\nat cruise altitude. Are you talking about true airspeed, or maybe you aren\u2019t\ncalculating correctly.\nProblematyka bliska ka\u017cdemu, polecam publikacj\u0119\nBest wishes regarding that challenging written content in this article.

It is similar to when\nsomeone who has never touched a guitar, picks one up and plays a solo.\nIt is a singular moment of absolutely beautiful chaos that can never be\nrecreated.\nAfter this incident, Malaysia Airlines is experiencing another tragedy about\nthe plane shoot. I hope Malaysia Airlines and the victims\u2019 relatives will\nrecover and can be given justice.\nI imagine pilots use autopilot for the same reason I use cruise control in my\ncar. Driving on an empty highway, there is no reason to vary speed, and\nkeeping my foot pressed on the accelerator for hours is tiring for my ankle,\nfor no benefit.\nYes. And the point is exactly what?\nGreat article, I have noticed that lately such mysterious incidents have\nincreased in the aviation industry. I regularly travel through Malaysian\nairlines and all my journeys have been quite pleasant. I really like their\nhospitality and customer service assistance. As travellers we should always\nresearch well before choosing an airline.\nPeople are calling Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 a mystery.\nBut to me, it\u2019s not a mystery.\nI\u2019ve known for 3 months what happened.\nContrary to the media, it was not aliens, or a fire, or a decompression:\nOne of the pilots (Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah) deliberately disabled the\naircraft\u2019s communication and tracking systems, turned the plane off course,\nand crashed it into the Southern Indian Ocean.\nSimilar things have happened before. Ever heard of Silkair 185 or Egyptair\n990?\nSure, with those crashes, the pilot crashed the plane without turning off\ncourse. But Zaharie had a better idea. Pull the circuit breakers to the\naircraft\u2019s communication and tracking systems, and to the black boxes. Then\nturn the aircraft off course, and crash it into the Southern Indian Ocean.\nWhat is the point? The point is obvious. The Southern Indian Ocean is one of\nthe most remote locations in the world. Of course he didn\u2019t want them to find\nthe wreckage of the plane.\nBased on the information we\u2019ve been given, there simply is no other\nexplanation for what happened.\nIf there were a fire severe enough to suddenly disable the aircraft\u2019s\ncommunication and tracking systems without warning, the plane would crash\nwithin minutes.\nIf there were a decompression, the pilot would descend to an altitude where\nthe air is thick enough to breathe, not turn the plane off course.\nUnless, of course, he deliberately caused the decompression.\nWow Mathew you KNOW what happened..amazing. Hell all the air crash\ninvestigation teams can go and find other work as all anyone has to do is give\nyou a call and you will KNOW the answer.\nI don\u2019t think so\nI\u2019m not the only one that knows. Many of the investigators know as well. We\njust don\u2019t know all the details.\nI so enjoy people who jump up to criticize other people while offering no\ncompeting theories of their own. Way to go, Einstein.\nLet\u2019s take a huge leap and assume, for sake of argument, that the pilot did\ndeliberately crash the airplane.\nWouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to expect that he would prefer that the world (local\ngovernment, terrorist group, whatever) see that result of his actions, instead\nof hiding it in \u201cone of the most remote locations in the world\u201d?\nNot necessarily.\nFor instance, the pilot who crashed EgyptAir 880 gave no indication of wanting\nthe whole world to know; having just been fired the previous night over\nrepeated sexual assaults, he just wanted to kill himself and take the\nairline\u2019s plane and passengers with him, and he did it at whatever moment he\nhappened to worm his way into one of the pilot seats. (Why the pilots hadn\u2019t\nbeen told that he\u2019d been fired is a mystery to me.)\nThere\u2019s just no way to know for sure.\nWith both Silkair 185 and Egyptair 990, the pilot who crashed the plane gave\nno indication of wanting the world to know.\nIn the case of Silkair 185, the captain pulled the circuit breakers to the\nblack boxes before crashing the plane.\nMatthew\nIgnore the clumsily sarcastic comment below your post. Of course you are\nabsolutely 100% spot on \u2014 perhaps a few details (maybe many) happened\ndifferently than the way you hypothesize, but the ESSENCE of your argument \u2014\nthat the pilot, for whatever reasons, deliberately set out to crash the plane,\nkilling everyone on board including himself and in the process making it as\ndifficult as possible for anyone trying to find an explanation \u2014 maybe he\u2019d\nbeen reading too many \u201cEarhart\u201d books \u2014 is precisely what happened. Even being\na non-professional \u2014 I don\u2019t think you need to have an aviation degree to\nfigure this out \u2014 I knew that this, or something extremely close to it (I\ninitially fingered the co-pilot) was the only possible explanation, within\nabout TWO WEEKS of the disappearance.\nI am also very bad at math, but I do know how to add, and 2+2 still equals 4,\nand the math in this little equation, to anyone with half a brain, was\nprecisely that simple; I just cannot believe how any other explanation can\npossibly be floated.\nAs for the ridiculously cynical rebuttal to your post, I can only say to that\nwriter: you have your head so firmly up your ass that you\u2019d need Drano instead\nof toothpaste.\n80 Chinese Engineers and Technicians for military stealth technology and radar\ntechnology have been on board of MH470.\nThey may have very well been on an MH470 flight (if there was one), but this\nis about MH370.  \nSigh\u2026 When will these absurd conspiracy theories end? Probably never, but\ncould you at least present your \u201cfacts\u201d with at least basic consistency? There\nwere supposed to be 20-something originally, now it\u2019s 80? How much longer\nuntil the number is at 400? 4000?\n\u201cThis is another example of the media relying on outside specialists (military\nsources, aeronautics professors, researchers and bureaucrats) to comment on\ncommercial airline operations \u2014 something they often know very little about.\u201d\nThe statement quoted would be absurd (and, I would hope, unlikely) even from\nan aeronautics professor or researcher. Surely. I mean, what is this dude\nAngus Houston smoking? And why would he feel that it was incumbent upon him to\nshare his ignorance in this way?\nOne other thing: Did you know that Rastafarians are forbidden to eat glass?\nok that is it !!!! we should all just now say it was shot down !!!! till they\ncan really prove otherwise ??? the only logical explanation for such a cover\nup is that it was shot down !!!!!!! of course those in power will use anything\nto keep a shoot down as far away from public knowledge so I will be surprised\nif my comment is even published. time for that Mark Twain quote : it is easier\nto fool people then to convince them they have been fooled !!!!!\nUnanswered questions.Proof of oil slick in south china sea was not that of\nmh370.Why was the plane asked to change course shortly after take off.Why did\nit take 17 minutes for the vietnamese air traffic controllers to respond after\nthe planes dissapearance.No proof of the transponder being switched off.Why\nwas it not picked up by military radar over malaysia if indeed the plane did\nchange course.If the plane ended up in the indian ocean auto pilot would have\nhad to be engaged manually. Was there any mayday message.Why were no jets\nscrambled after the dissapearance remember 9 11.My conclusion is that its in\nthe south china sea after being shot down or has been plucked out off the sky\nby some greater force.We are not meant to find this plane.\nAfter the victims and families, the big losers in MH370 are the lawyers\u2026they\ndon\u2019t know whom to sue, and why!  \nBTW: Why so much talk about pilot experience? On overseas flights the\ncomputer\u2019s flying the aircraft after departure control clearance until\napproach control (and sometimes beyond).\n(NC = Normal Cruising true air speed)\nOn March 28, the ATSB issued a statement that said:\n1) We\u2019re moving search site 34% closer to last radar contact point  \n2) Reason: now believed MH370 used MORE fuel BEFORE losing contact\nBoth theory and practice hotly dispute any link between 1) and 2).\nKey point: they never changed the TIME MH370 crashed \u2013 just its POSITION. This\nforces a SPEED 34% slower than the NC originally projected. As a jet slows, it\nmust descend, and plow through denser air. Too slow, and it costs MORE fuel to\nstay aloft for a set period of time than it does at NC.\nTheoretical support: a recent study by Delgado/Prats: \u201cFuel consumption\nassessment for speed variation concepts during the cruise phase\u201d: Fig.6 (p.8)\nshows he impact of systematically varied TAS on fuel consumption. These\nresults suggest endurance is maximized at a mere 13% below NC; the graph\u2019s\ncurvature, if extended, suggests that endurance at 34% below NC would result\nin POORER endurance than at NC.\nPractical support: in 2005, a Boeing 777-200LR broke the endurance record for\ncommercial aircraft (22 hours, 42 minutes). It did so by flying 11,664\nnautical miles, for an average ground speed of 513.8 knots \u2013 very CLOSE to NC,\nnot 34% slower. Even after allowing for potentially strong tailwinds, the\nimplied TAS would still flatly contradict the official theory\u2019s implicit\nassertion that endurance is maximized by plowing for several hours through\ndense air, not coasting on top of it.\nWhy is the aviation community not shouting at the top of its lungs demanding\nthe ATSB answer this key question: \u201cif your model update left MH370 with LESS\nendurance available for the southward leg, why did it shift you to a scenario\nthat required MORE endurance?\u201d?\nAt a given engine setting, the plane will use the same amount of fuel per unit\nof time. Yes, it will slow down, but other than that, if the plane\u2019s airspeed\nis above stall speed, it will stay aloft for about the same time (not counting\nthe time it will take for the plane to fall).\nOnly up to a point, tl \u2013 otherwise, endurance would be maximized by turning\nthe engine OFF.\nAs speed reduces, the endurance BENEFITS you correctly describe are eventually\novertaken by additional energy COSTS required to maintain altitude (camber\nlift reduced -> must be replaced by deflection lift -> more drag -> more\nthrust required to offset).\nIf the plane is allowed to constantly descend, then these costs are mitigated\n\u2013 but new ones arise: the lower your altitude, the more the plane needs to\nfight to plow through denser air.\nIf you were right, then the endurance (longest TIME in the air)record I\nmention above would have been set using a very low cruising speed. It was not\n\u2013 it was set using a very HIGH cruising speed.\nApologies \u2013 missed your \u201cabove stall speed\u201d qualifier\u201d \u2013 so I retract the\n\u201cturning engine off\u201d comment.\nBut the rest of my comment is valid: once at altitude, there is a minimum\nspeed \u2013 which is well in EXCESS of stall speed \u2013 that maximizes endurance. The\nspeed at which the record was set proves it, and the physics I describe above\nexplain it.\nI stand by my point: for a given power setting, if the plane stays above stall\nspeed, the endurance, expressed as time, is going to be the same.\nI actually think we\u2019re BOTH right \u2013 all I\u2019m saying is that, for large\ncommercial aircraft on long flights, minimum drag = maximum endurance =\nminimum power setting required to maintain altitude \u2013 ANY altitude \u2013 is\nachieved at surprisingly fast speeds, and at a surprisingly high altitude.\nBoeing set the record by getting up and over the atmosphere, and then coasting\n(at nearly top speed) for 22 hours.\n\u201cMy hunch is that a malfunction, rather than foul play, brought the plane\ndown. A poorly handled decompression, for example, caused by a structural\nproblem or windscreen failure. Or a catastrophic electrical failure combined\nwith smoke, fire or fumes that rendered the crew unconscious. Granted that\ndoesn\u2019t totally jibe with the evidence, but none of the theories do.\u201d\nEspecially with the mess the Malaysian government has made of communicating\nwith the public, it\u2019s rather hard to say what the \u201cevidence\u201d is at this point.\nHowever, if one accepts the possibility of pilot suicide (with \u2014 precisely \u2014\nthe intention of making the event an insoluble mystery), then locking yourself\ninto the flight deck, shutting down all evidence-producing devices, telling\nthe autopilot to fly you to the Southern Ocean, then knocking back a nice big\nbarbiturate-laced vodka or three makes a sick sort of sense.\nAnd God knows there are plenty of nuts out there.\n[\u2026] we get yet another annoying conversation about transponders. My full\ncritique is here\u2026 https://www.askthepilot.com/malaysia-\u2026es-flight-370/ PS [\u2026]\nI reran my initial simulation and I wanted to share my results. Mind you this\nincluded all of the known altitude and turns from known data. I ran it with\nthe mind set of a rouge pilot. Specifically I flew just below maximum speed\nfor a given altitude thinking that a rogue pilot would want as much distance\nas possible. That put me 10 minutes ahead of last radar contact off the coast\nof Thailand.\nI remained at 4500 feet from coast of Thailand to NW coast of Indo.\nAfterwards, I flew at a slower speed than previous run. 385 knots, 37500 feet\nin altitude and a heading of 180, (Due South), after rounding NW Indo. That\nput me into the search area right on time.\nIt was eerie watching the sun rise with SW Indo slipping away behind me. When\nI reached 3 1/2 hours from shark bay and had 2/12 hours of fuel, I knew I was\nat the point of no return. I ditched at S25 E94 at 8:37 am.\nNothing in my simulation raised any inconsistencies with all publicly released\ndata. I think the search is right on target and will locate the final resting\nplace with in a few months.\nVery helpful additional perspective, Todd \u2013 thanks.\nWas 385kts GROUND speed?\nThe \u201cHIGHEST PROBABILITY\u201d path published last week requires 323kts ground\nspeed for the last 2 hours \u2013 roughly 326kts GS average for the six hours post-\nradar. Can you explain the difference?\nFinally (and sorry for the inundation): are you able to make the ORIGINAL\nsearch site (roughly 480 knots GS, I believe), or do you run out of fuel?\nThanks!\nFurther inundation \u2013 this time just an FYI: when I cross-ref the published\n\u201cHIGHEST PROBABILITY\u201d search zone against Google Earth, I get S20s E103 \u2013 586\nnmi NE of your S25 E94 ditch point, and 270 nmi closer to VAMPI.\nso seeing that the plane might never be found you now say that your hunch is\nthat a malfunction brought it down? right after the plane\u2019s disappearance you\nwrote that there was clearly something nefarious going on in this case. the\npilots should all stick together, huh? you know well that multiple changes of\nthe plane\u2019s course and altitude make hijacking and suicide the most probable\ncause. The person who intentionally brought this plane down might now kind of\nget away with it.\nWhatever happened to that plane, it doesnt make any sense (stating the\nobvious\u2026) compared to other \u201csimilar incidents\u201d. Because;\n1 \u2013 Malfunction;  \nThis can still be the case. Something might have happened which cut off all\ncommunication and they kept struggling with the plane until it crashed. They\nmay have lost all vital instruments which explains the erratic change in\naltitude and heading. To navigate at night with no instruments and absence of\na horizon and landmarks is extremely difficult, if not impossible. It doesnt\ntake long until you dont have a clue about heading and which altitude you`re\nat.\n2 \u2013 Hijacking;  \nEither the hijackers succeeded or the pilots and/or passengers were in control\nafter fighting them off.  \nLets pretend the hijackers were in control and the plane were in good shape\nand all instruments and communication were still working. Like Patrick have\nmentioned several times; why are there no one taking responsibility for the\nhijacking? Why did they hijack a plane without knowing they could acually fly\nit and land it safely somewhere? Of course, the whole point of the hijacking\ncould be just to crash it and kill everyone onboard (suicide hijacking). But\nthey didnt have to keep flying for several hours before crashing the plane.  \nLets pretend the pilots were in control after the attempted hijacking. They\nwould, if they could, turn around or land at the nearest airport. No words\nfrom the pilots.  \nOr, both the hijackers and the crew were eliminated and some poor passengers\ndid what they could for as long as they could.\n3 \u2013 Pilot suicide/hijacking;  \nAll he (or they) had to do was turn off the autopilot and crash the plane. No\nneed to fly around for several hours, changing heading and altitude and\neventually decide enough is enough and crash the plane. If the pilot(s) wanted\nto hijack the plane and take it to a destination of their choice, they already\nknew the fuel status and how far that would take them instead of running dry\nin the middle of nowhere.\nAll 3 theories creates a lot of questions. But I dont think we can rule out\nany of them as more or less unthinkable at this point.\nThe first officer would not know how to navigate from the stars at night, but\nthe captain would (although he would probably be rusty).  \nHowever, out of over 200 passengers, do you seriously believe NOBODY would\nhave a GPS-equipped phone? They could ask and get any number of them, place\nthem behind the windshield and see their position constantly \u2014 battery life\ndoesn\u2019t mean a thing, since you wouldn\u2019t turn on unused phones, just those you\nare using, and switch once the battery dies.  \nPlenty of methods of navigation were still left to them.\n>> The first officer would not know how to navigate from the stars at night,\nbut the captain would << I'm curious how you came up with that idea. First of\nall, it's not like captains are trained in certain types of navigation, while\nfirst officers are not. Training for both positions is more or less the same.\nEither way, celestial navigation hasn't been taught to pilots since the 1950s,\nso far as I know.\nI meant the age difference \u2014 the first officer was 27 years old, the captain\nwas 53.  \nEven so, celestial navigation was only used until the sixties, so unless Capt.\nAhmad studied it himself, you\u2019re right he wouldn\u2019t know it, since he was\ntrained in the eighties or later.\n\u201cHowever, out of over 200 passengers, do you seriously believe NOBODY would\nhave a GPS-equipped phone?\u201d\nSeriously, I believe most phones today have GPS.\nEven more seriously; I find it hard to believe they would collect all phones\nand throw them on the \u201cdashboard\u201d, one by one till the battery ran out, and\nnavigate successfully.  \nDriving around in your Lexus looking for a Jack in the Box is one thing.\nNavigating a B777 is something else.\nBest case scenario; the phone would tell you where you were, you still have no\nclue about heading, speed and altitude.\nGPS gives you position if you are in sight of 3 satellites. If you are in\nsight of at least 4 satellites, it also provides your altitude.  \nGPS also gives you speed, but even if it didn\u2019t, you could compute it\nyourself.  \nFinally, new phones usually have a compass. Other than that, a compass is\nsomething so low-tech that you could slap it together at the very least, but I\nimagine the plane has it. Finally, you can compute heading just by looking for\nsome standard features in the sky (I don\u2019t know the reference points in\nsouthern sky, but it\u2019s Polaris in the North).  \nAt worst, if you do have a position reading, take two readings and compute the\nangle between your N/S and E/W heading and you have your heading.\nGPS is a receiver not a transmitter. How the heck would that have located the\nphone. Answer\u2026It wouldn\u2019t. So much technology in ignorant people\u2019s hands. You\ndon\u2019t even understand how a telegraph works.\n[\u2026] (See Smith\u2019s fuller explanation of transponders, radar, cabin\ndecompression, and different elements of airline flying right here.) [\u2026]\nWhy can\u2019t at least the wings be made of carbon steel or something lite that\ncould be made to float? At least long enough for a water landing and escape.\nHow much truth is in the up and down altitudes and the use of fuel?  \nAll those experts and they can\u2019t find it yet after a month of continuous\nsearching? They must be looking in the wrong direction.  \nWould wind direction have any influence?\nMany airplanes already have carbon fiber wings, which are light and extremely\nstrong. Im not sure what material the 370 had.  \nThe wings are the most likely part to float as it is, depending on damages on\nimpact of course. The whole plane could actually float in perfect conditions,\nremember the Hudson landing. Although it wont float forever, obviously.\nWings are designed to make the plane fly, not to make to plane float \ud83d\ude09\nAltitudes and use of fuel is correct. The lower the altitude, the more fuel it\nburns. If you wonder why, you can google it. Too much to explain here \ud83d\ude42\nIf the wings don\u2019t disintegrate on contact with water and the fuel tanks were\nempty, they will float for weeks since the fuel tanks are filled with nitrogen\nat that point (regulations require tanks must be filled with inert gas as they\nare emptied).  \nHowever, wings usually do disintegrate and the fuel tanks fill with water\nquite rapidly.  \n\u2014  \nOh, and \u201cplane at lower altitude uses more fuel\u201d is inaccurate or wrong. It\nwill use more fuel per unit of distance covered, but this is simply because\nthe plane flies slower at the same engine power setting.  \nSecond, the plane will actually use a lot more fuel for takeoff at higher\naltitudes.  \nPlease be as precise as possible. This really helps prevent unnecessary\ncommunication issues.\nI am convinced that 777 is nearer land. I feel, that, similar to Swissair 111,\nthere was a failure of the entertainment equipment so that perhaps it caused a\nfire where the smoke made it impossible for the pilots to see or breathe and\nthat before they ditched, they tried to get rid of fuel and land somewhere on\nthe peninsula. Perhaps it is in an uninhabited bit of land, or nearby in\nshallower water. What I would like to know is have small boats been all around\nthe perimeters looking for debris. I have not had any answer to this at all.  \nIt makes sense to me, but I am willing to be corrected.\nI finally got a chance to fly the route on a flight simulator using a 777ER. I\nwas amazed at how all of the times lined up almost perfectly. I am now\nconvinced the pilot was making a run towards Antarctica. He knew he would\nnever make it but expected to get to the Southern Imarsat ping arch where the\nsearch was originally. His descent to 5K used up a ton of fuel. Must have\nknown Malaysia or Thailand were looking for him as evidenced by radio chatter.\nI was also amazed that after you round Indo, put your heading at 180 (Due\nSouth) you end up exactly where they are looking for it. My speed at 450 knots\nbrought me to the search area an hour early so speed was likely 400 knots from\nIndo to crash site. That is a very slow speed designed for fuel economy. I\nstill believe he landed intact as the reason for no wreckage.\nI find it hard to believe that anyone, let alone a pilot could think this is\nanything but a in flight hijacking. No amount of malfunction can account for\nmultiple turns to avoid Thailand and Indonesia and ending up off of Australia.\nEven the pilot of this plane new better than to go near Indo. If they had\nflown over it would have been seen. Instead it went around. This is a pilot\nhijacking or passenger hijacking. If we find the plane at the bottom intact\nlike I think we will it will prove no malfunction. Just really bad intent.\nEven if it did land intact, which I doubt, the water pressure down there will\nprobably tear the plane apart.\nActually, if you let the water in the pressure would be equal inside and out.\nI don\u2019t know if you could do this through the pressurization system or if you\nwould have to crack a door. Any aviation experts have any thoughts?\nWho said what now?\nLook, a survivable landing in the open ocean would be difficult enough.\nFinessing with outflow valves and doors to equalize pressure or whatever\u2026.?\nI\u2019m not even sure what you\u2019re asking, exactly, but this is silly speculation.\nThe miracle on the Hudson proves it can be done without setting off the ELT.\nThe fact that we have zero debris in an area indicated by Imarsat Pings,\nPinger locator, and likely point of no fuel all point to a water landing. If\nyou have a better explanation that fits all of the data above I am all ears.\nWhat you call silly speculation, I consider a logical assessment of the facts\nPossibly it _was_ a hijacking. Like I said, I\u2019m not ruling anything out.\nBut by whom? For what?\nTerrorist groups don\u2019t hijack planes in order to disappear them intact at the\nbottom of the ocean. That makes no sense, strategically, and would be\nextraordinarily difficult to coordinate and pull off. Terrorism is always low-\ntech, low-risk (look at September 11th).\nAnd if it was one of the pilots\u2026 again, what\u2019s the point? If you\u2019re on a\nsuicide mission, why not simply crash the damn plane into the ocean, right\nthen and there, like the EgyptAir pilot apparently did. Instead, you embark on\na long, elaborate, convoluted mission, flying for several hours, all for the\npurpose of not being found? Why?\nIt is my belief that the pilot cracked as a result of the opposition leader\nbeing convicted on trumped up charges. Since Malaysia owns the airline, he\nwanted to make the plane disappear, causing a large loss financially and\nillustrating the likely incompetence of the ruling party in the subsequent\ninvestigation. He did not want his role revealed and felt he could make the\nplane disappear forever. This required a water landing which I am confident he\nmanaged to pull off.\nYes! THIS!\nI mean yes he cracked up, but the plane did not water land. The debris tells\nus it hit the water fast and hard and broke up.\n[\u2026] no bounds.

I wish to make l a deal with you: If the airplane is in the caldera,\nyou pay your own way; if l it is not in the caldera, l shall pay your way.\nPlease let me know, immediately, Patrick, if you would like to take up my\noffer. Thank you. Regards, Michael Flanagan, M.D. f et.\nAfter weeks of thinking, watching, reading \u2026 And knowing absolutely nothing\nabout flying \u2026I have come to a horrendous conclusion.  \nSomething happened on the flight that left the person(s) in control of the\nplane 2 choices.  \n1\\. Attempt to land (or crash) on terra firma with the new knowledge or belief\nthat this would result in a catastrophe with many thousands killed  \nOR  \n2\\. Sacrifice the lives of everyone on board to save the lives of thousands\nand avoid catastrophe. So take the plane and the source of the potential\ncatastrophe as far away from land and populated places as possible.  \nWhoever it was chose the second option.\nOnce they have made such a decision, there would be nobody to stop them from\nfollowing through.  \nSo why didn\u2019t they contact ATC?  \nFurthermore, if Diego Garcia was indeed within range, I am sure this would\nhave been a better destination, since DG would be equipped to deal with almost\nany contingency.  \nFinally, they would have a fair chance of ditching in shallow waters or on a\nbeach of some remote island, if Diego Garcia was not an option. Either way,\nthey had options.\nIn my previous comment I was not attempting to provide an explanation for why\nthis plane crashed or if even that the plane had crashed because of a rogue or\nmentally disturbed pilot.I was simply providing my opinion based on the\nassumption that the plane had in-fact been unlawfully commandeered. The plane\nwould have been flown either manually or on autopilot for the seven hours\nuntil it crashed supposedly in the Southern Indian Ocean. Someone on the plane\nmust have noticed that something was amiss because the fact is the plane never\nmade it to China and was in the wrong position and heading in the wrong\ndirection for the majority of the flight. The passengers could have noticed\nthat it was still pretty much dark when the plane went down when the sun would\nhave risen over Beijing and it would have been about seven o\u2019clock there. The\nerratic flight profile of the plane suggests that it was being flown by an\nexperienced pilot who was trying to avoid radar contact. It was just the\ntiming of the accident, given that it had occurred just days after another\npane had been hi-jacked and the constant media scrutiny given to the hi-jack\ntheory that prompted me to give my account for what may have happened. Again,\nwe will only know what actually happened once the black boxes and the wreckage\nof the plane is located and an investigation is launched. The media has really\nbeen unprofessional in how they have handled this disaster. They attempt to\nmake out reasons why this plane may have crashed without fully understanding\nhow aircraft work and how planes are tracked in flight. But to me the vast\nmajority of possible mechanical failures seem unlikely as the plane continued\non for several hours and no distress signal was received. Only a Helios flight\n522 repeat type scenario involving the pressurization of the jet or a\ncatastrophic electrical failure could explain the strange movements of the\nplane or the lack of distress signal. We will just have to wait ans see what\nthe investigators find if and when this plane is located.\nI have been watching the search for flight 370 with fascination and interest.\nThe smarts brought to bear appear to be impressive, and for weeks it seemed\nthe searcher were \u201calmost there\u201d.\nAll along it occurred to me that maybe we ought to do what engineers do when\nthey have great uncertainty. Model and simulate. The modeling seems to have\ngone well, but with no results yet. With each day, the aircraft\u2019s signature\n(footprint?) in the Indian Ocean fades.\nIs it practical to set up one of the many jets in the \u201cairplane graveyard\u201d,\nfit it with engines and guidance, certified for flying.\nThen, fit the plane with all the GPS transducers and data recorders possible,\nand allow the unmanned aircraft flying out to sea unmanned from Australia, to\nrun out of fuel, (as we believe 370 had done) over the Indian Ocean.\nIf properly instrumented, we would at a minimum have some idea of the nature\nof the impact, the spread of the debris field (remember everything is\ninstrumented) over a period of ninety days. Similarly we could track the oils,\nfuel, etc. and see how long it takes until it is subsumed by the sea.\nExpensive, but not greatly so, considering the knowledge that might be gained.\nComments or critiques welcome.\nYes, that could be an interesting exercise to see what you see.\nI had a related idea a couple weeks ago when the pings were the news. Since\nthe geosynchronous satellite has a slight worble in its so-called \u2018stationary\u2019\ntrack, they could use that worble along with the Doppler Effect to determine\nwhich direction that plane really went.\nI wondered how helpful it might be to have aircraft queued up to head both\nnorth & south from the last waypoint and let them loose when the satellite\narrived at the same point in its path as it was on the night that MH370 went\nmissing.\nBut if the captain had flown the plane of course, there were seven hours\nbetween the plane being deliberately taken off course and crashing into the\nIndian Ocean. One question i have is why did no-one try to o anything to take\nback control?? The passengers on United 93 during the 9/11 attacks used a\ntrolley to smash the cockpit door down and tried to regain control of the\nplane. Couldn\u2019t the passengers have done that here?? I know that the door is\nbuilt to be bullet proof and designed to be hijacker proof but something must\nhave been done by the crew. And where was the first officer or the cabin crew\nmember who is supposed to stand guard when one pilot is out of the cockpit.\nIt\u2019s beginning to look like this is a copy of the Ethiopian Airlines 702\nhijack this year where the first officer took the plane to Geneva (i think,\nmight be wrong) after the captain went out of the cockpit and the first\nofficer somehow either disabled or tampered with the cockpit door locking\nsystem and flew it to Geneva. This should have served as a wake up call but\nobviously the corrupt so called ICAO safety organization did not pay enough\nattention and so here we are a month and a bit later after a plane carrying\n239 innocent people which has crashed and whose wreckage still has not been\nlocated. Think about the lives and the millions which could have been saved if\nthe ICAO had taken the Feb. 2014 incident seriously. I love aviation for all\nits beauty and engineering marvels but I sometimes think that there are those\nat the top who are trying undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the safety of\nair travel to keep their pockets full. This was a completely avoidable\ndisaster that should not have any place in our modern aviation era. I would\nwelcome other fellow users thoughts on my opinion.\n\u2013 One question i have is why did no-one try to o anything to take back\ncontrol??\nWe dont know what happened on that plane. Maybe someone did try?  \nIts impossible to try to figure out what really happened up there.\n\u2013 Think about the lives and the millions which could have been saved if the\nICAO had taken the Feb. 2014 incident seriously.\nYou have to remember that flying is still THE safest way to travel, by far.\nEach day there are thousands of successful arrivals and departures around the\nworld. The list would be endless (and impossible) if the industry were to\nprotect itself from any hypothetical threat. Just because there was one nutty\npilot doesnt mean that this is something likely to happen again anytime soon.  \nAnd if there really is another nutty pilot out there, Im pretty sure he would\nfigure out a way to hijack or bring down a plane, no matter what ICAO did to\nprevent it.\nI heard someone on tv suggesting that pilots should not be able to plan or\neven know who they were flying with. The pilots flying together would be a\nsecret until they met for preflight briefing so that two pilots were unlikely\nto plan a hijack or something else.  \nI almost fell off my couch. This is typical media stuff and only adds to the\npublic hysteria. Pilots are the last thing to worry about and its incredibly\nunjust to suspect them based on one nutty pilot.\nWhat do we think of your opinion? We think its a fail. An epic fail. And you\nare probably trolling us\u2026\nAs a conclusion, it shows baseless assumptions and retarded development \u2013\nunless you know something that no one else knows.\nAt this point, we don\u2019t know how much of the deviation is due to mechanical\nfailure, emergency event, pilot error, or malfeasance by a pilot or someone\nelse. So it is an assumption to say the it was deliberately flown off course.\nLikewise, it is still an assumption that it has crashed in the Indian Ocean.\nThat has yet to be proven or even indicated by any debris. You even argue\nagainst yourself when you point to the fact that no wreckage has yet been\nlocated.\nWhy do you believe that no one tried to do anything to take back control? What\ndo you base this conclusion on? Maybe they tried unsuccessfully? Maybe they\nwere all MIA as well?\nOr even if they were successful, if sleeping passengers woke up and tried the\ntrolley trick that you proposed, who knows if any of them knew how to operate\na jet? So-called taking control may not have made any difference if no one had\nspent years learning the control system of a 777-200ER.\nHow do you know that either of the pilots left for the loo \u2013 much less that it\nwas the Captain\u2026as you imply? How is any of this beginning to look anything at\nall like Ethiopian Airlines 702 other than what you are inventing? What\ninformation did you hear/see about what actually happened on-board MH370?\nWhere you there? Are you the only known survivor?\nWhat do you know about what the ICAO did or did not do after Flight 702? That\nincident happened 2/17/17 and missing flight MH370 departed 19 days later on\n3/8/14. Did you really expect that an international agency would have\nimplemented some reactionary, worldwide plan in only 19 days? And imposed such\na plan on hundreds of private businesses (airlines) such that those companies\nwould have retro-fitted thousands of planes and/or trained tens of thousands\nof employees? C-mon, man!\nFailing to do all that, it is now your contention that the ICAO is a corrupt\norganization? You should be starting to see why your guessing looks to show\nretarded development of the conclusion, if not the concluder.\nIts another assumption that there are 239 innocent people. Sure, some, even\nmost, might be innocent. But here you are arguing against yourself again.\nUnless you believe that a rogue pilot who deliberately takes a plane off\ncourse, and looks himself in the cockpit is himself innocent, then how do you\nget to 239?\nDo you have any idea how business, finances, and economics work? Really, even\nthe slightest idea?? Those at the top of the airline industry line their\npockets when passengers are paying fares and flying more and more. But when\nplanes go missing, the opposite happens. Some people lose faith in the airline\nsafety which suggests that they will take fewer flights meaning that the\nairlines earn less revenue and lower profits. Also, losing a $250,000,000\nasset does nothing to help fill the pockets of those on top. In fact, it does\nthe exact opposite. Since the company now has to replace that vehicle, they\nhave much less money with which to help themselves. Have you been watching?\nDoes this missing plane make it more likely that Malaysian Airlines will A)\ngive their CEO a big raise; or B) go out of business?\nThanks for guessing \u2013 unfortunately, that is not what this website is about.\nThe next time you are tempted to respond, you might want to get some sense\nfirst. It could even be helpful to read Patricks book Cockpit Confidential so\nyou do look like such a noob.\nCheers!\nAccording to the poll: \u201c5 percent believe the disappearance is related to\nsupernatural or alien activity; and 3 percent think it was shot down by a\nforeign government.\u201d\nWhile neither possibility is terribly likely, I find it slightly amusing that\nmore people hold space aliens or magic responsible than foreign governments.\nwith this new co-pilot\u2019s cell phone was turned on but no calls made \u2014 it made\nme think he turned it on in hopes of being tracked but didn\u2019t make call\nbecause somebody was watching/controlling him.\nI recently watched a netflix doc on the kennedy plane the went down by\nMartha\u2019s vinyard. in the doc it was really convincing that it was sabatoge by\nan unidentified second pilot. apparenty fuel gage was turned to off which\nwouldn\u2019t be necessary for a nose dive suicide. the nose dive also occured\nimmediately following last time Kennedy Made contact with \u2014 an air tower \u2013 or\nwhatever they are called. watching the doc rekindled the idea that with\nMalaysia flt somebody intentionally rerouted plane immediately after the last\ncontact because it would give them biggest window of time before somebody\nnoticed they were not in contact. And also took the plane as far away from\nwhere it might be found as possible in homes of making discovery of black box\nas unlikely as possible.\nThere was talk of a murder as possible motive early on \u2014 that somebody(s) with\na lot of tactical power wanted somebody(s) on that plane dead \u2014 and this was\nelaborate way of getting it done with no evidence. pretty elaborate. but also\neffective if that was it.\nObviously I have no idea what was going on in that plane or in the cockpit.\nBut the thing about his cell phone trying to get connection is something very\ndifferent from making a phone call (if that was ever tried). The plane might\nhave been low enough to be able to pick up a signal, but the speed is what\nmakes it hard, if not impossible, to get a stable connection.\nIm not sure if you compared Malaysian flight with the Kennedy accident in any\nway, but that plane was flying much lower and slower, so in that case it would\nbe possible to use a cell phone.\nPatrick has already explained this time and time again. The co-pilot wouldn\u2019t\nbe be able to make any cell phone call at all nor have any reception.\nCell phone towers only have a range of a couple miles, that\u2019s why in a city\nyou see lots of cell towers everywhere; big, small, visible, hidden, on top of\nbuildings, on top of businesses, etc.\nThey were flying over the ocean most of the time far from any cell tower\nreception. And even over land, at normal cruising altitude of 30,000 feet,\nthat\u2019s 5.6 miles from the ground far away from any cell tower reception.\nPeriod.\nI heard an interesting (crazy?) story last night on CNN.  \nThis Australian guy whos been on CNN lately, mid 60`s, grey hair and glasses\n(looks like a character from The Muppet Show \u2013 no offence).\nThey were talking about the cell phone signal picked up from one of the\npilots. He then said its highly possible since he once received a text message\nat 35000ft when flying from Perth to Melbourne.\nNow, first of all, when youre flying between Perth and Melbourne, close to 70%\nof the flight is over the ocean.  \nIn addition to that, there is a lot of rural areas before you approach any of\nthose cities. Based on cell phone coverage maps in Australia, there are not\nmany spots along that route you would pick up a cell phone signal. Much less\nat 35000ft.\nHe didnt say which carrier he flew with, but a wild guess would be Virgin or\nQantas. Both of them have cell phone service on some of their planes. But\nthose signals are coming from satellites.  \nNOT from cell towers on the ground.\nI would be surprised if he dont know the difference.\nIf it was that easy, why would airlines spend tens of millions of dollar for\nsatellite cell phone service onboard?\nToo bad thats all he said and no one even questioned him.\nIm sure Ive spent close to 5000 hours at FL350 and I have never seen a single\ndot on my signal bar. Heck, I usually lose the signal once they close the door\nat the gate.\nAll true\u2026 though you can, occasionally, pick up a momentary signal at high\naltitudes. It might last a few seconds, but it won\u2019t be reliable enough to\nplace a normal call over.\nQ: How does the autopilot behaves if the engines are running out of fuel?  \nDoes it still try to keep flight level/direction programmed. -> this would\nresult in a stall situation i assume since speed will go down without engines\nrunning. And as far as i remember autopilot will then switch off if situation\ncannot be handled anymore, right?  \nOR will the autopilot keep the aircraft in a stable flight situation still? ->\nthis would result in a nose down, keeping at least the programmed direction\nand a minimum speed level to avoid stall.\nWhen the engines are running out of fuel, eventually all systems will shut\ndown, including the auto pilot. Generators onboard are depending on the\nengines to run. There are back up systems but those will only last for so\nlong. If the pilots were awake they would still be able to control the plane,\nto some degree.  \nBut in this case, where it seems like no one(?) actually were flying the\nplane, it will just become a glider and end up wherever the weather and other\nfactors decide.\nQuestion: Doesn\u2019t the fact that the pilot (whoever it was who made the last\ntransmission) did not contact HCM when he was given the frequency, indicate\nthat it was one of the pilots who hijacked the plane? Isn\u2019t it standard\noperating procedure to do so immediately? If so, then one should be able to\nrule out the possibility that any catastrophic error could have occurred\nwithin those few seconds.\nTo cloak an aircraft would be extremely difficult. Firstly how would the\nequipment be brought on-board the aircraft? I would also assume that this\nequipment would need to be assembled or otherwise readied for it to begin\nworking. And then once the aircraft has been smuggled what then? Leave it on\nthe the tarmac to rot?? Use it for another terrorist attack? What about the\ncrew and passengers? You could shoot them or keep them prisoner but you would\nneed to keep them away from any communication from the outside world. It would\nbe an extremely difficult task to pull off, especially considering that if the\nplan fails it will cause great embarrassment to your country or organisation\nand lead to a long and bitter legal case and possible sanctions and other\nprosecutions. Better of cloaking one of your own fighter planes and flying it\nover North Korea and bombing Pyongyang to show off your technology.\ni have this wild imagination,coupled with aviation and ATS background which\nprompts me to say:  \nIt is some state sponsered technology test where technology \u201d How to make a\nobject/ aircraft untraceble by Radar and communication System\u201d.  \nu will surely agree that this would be very useful defence tool for any\ncountry.  \nWe already have low flying stealth aircrafts which cannot be tracked by radar.\nWe have jammmers which when activated would not allow any onboard eqpt to be\ntracked.  \nThe amount of expertise required and the planning to execute it requires\nconsistent short-term testing of technology and huge coverup exercise on media\n.  \nOnly state sponsered programme can do this\u2026 and what are few lives of common\nmen in pursuit of technolgy superiority..\nThe hard part is to make an invisibility cloak big enough for a jumbo jet,\nstrong enough to withstand the sub-sonic winds, and retardant enough to not\ncatch fire.\nYou know, ever since stealth technologies first started developing the\npriority were to hide it. The less your enemy know the better.\nAdd that if someone had the resources to make such a good stealth, jamming\ntechnolgy possible, if they were intelligent people they would test the\nequipment in a controlled enviroment. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t buy or lease a\nbig jet airliner to test your tech. Why be so dumb as to cause an incident to\ndraw the attention of all the world? You\u2019d only see such stupid plan or\nbehavior from a cartoon villain failing to read the evil overload list.\nThe\nWhy aren\u2019t planes that fly over oceans required to have an EPIRB that releases\nfrom hydrostatic pressure in water. This is standard technology on ships and\nit seems like there have been multiple airline crashes at this point where\nlocating the crash site would have benefited from having these.\nThere are proposals for blackboxes to be ejected on water crashes. But\nburocracy is usually one of the obstacles for a lot of things in aviation.\nEven if the proposal is heard and accepted, for it to become law it will take\nyears, and add more time for new planes to be equipped with it or older ones\nto be retrofitted.\nThat makes sense, going forward.\nBut I just don\u2019t understand why EPIRB technology, which has been around for a\nlong time and is used on every ship, hasn\u2019t already been deployed on\nairplanes. Ejecting the black box (and making it buoyant) seems like a major\nmodification. But a little locator beacon popping off under 4 meters of water\nwould have greatly helped searchers find both Malaysian Airlines 370 and Air\nFrance 447, I think. It\u2019s lightweight, tried, and true technology (and I\nsuspect relatively cheap.)\nIt seems like a no-brainer, and usually when a solution seems like a no-\nbrainer, there\u2019s a pretty sophisticated reason it isn\u2019t being done. (At least\nwhen it comes to airplanes.)\n> Ejecting the black box (and making it buoyant)  \n> seems like a major modification.  \nAgreed. And it wouldn\u2019t help at any rate. You kind of expect and want the\nblack box to stay with the wreckage.\n> But a little locator beacon popping off under 4 meters  \n> of water would have greatly helped searchers find both  \n> Malaysian Airlines 370 and Air France 447, I think.  \n> It\u2019s lightweight, tried, and true technology  \n> (and I suspect relatively cheap.)  \nAgreed. Obviously it would drift away after some time, but in the short time\nafter the flight is lost, it would still be possible to locate it very\naccurately.  \nHOWEVER, that assumes you are looking in the right location. In the case of\nMH370, it\u2019s not clear whether it would help. Even if it had 100+ km range, you\nwould still need to be at least fairly close by to detect it. The search\nshifted to southern Indian Ocean after a week, meaning the beacon could have\nbeen quite a distance from the impact site.  \nNow, I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s possible, but GPS receivers are ubiquitous\ntoday. Would it be possible to add one to such a beacon and have it record its\nlocation every hour or so, starting with the moment when it is released from\nthe plane and acquires signal?  \nOnce it\u2019s finally retrieved, it would clearly indicate where the impact was\nand how the ocean currents moved it from its original position.\n> It seems like a no-brainer, and usually when a solution  \n> seems like a no-brainer, there\u2019s a pretty sophisticated  \n> reason it isn\u2019t being done. (At least when it comes  \n> to airplanes.)  \nI thought the same thing. But then again, there were suggestions to add\nsurveillance cameras to planes and record footage from them on another black\nbox. The weight of the whole system (minus the armor on the box itself) would\nbe around several kilograms, and the cost would be pretty much negligible, so\nit makes sense.  \nBut it also makes sense to record more than just last two hours of flight deck\nconversations. As I understood some articles, there will only be two hours\u2019\nworth of voice recordings, which is fairly useless if there indeed was a\nstruggle in the first hours of flight. I mean, come on, a cheap SD card can\nhold several months\u2019 worth of speech with compression, down to maybe a few\ndays if good quality is desirable.  \nHonestly, with some advances in aviation technology, it\u2019s usually outmoded\nwhen introduced and while upgrades could be made cheap and efficient, they are\nnever carried out.\nAnother question:\nWhen KAL 007 was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1983, the Americans had\ntop secret radar that they gave to the investigators which had tracked the\nplane when it was shot down. This is thirty years later and we still didnt\nknow where the plane was until last week or so. I know that the transponder\nwouldnt have given information as there is a lack of radar coverage over large\nstreches of the oceans. However there are hundreds of satellites orbiting\nEarth of which some are operated by several of the South Asian nations. Having\nan un-identified aircraft flying over this region would have triggered alarm\nbells in several countries radar stations. Either these countries are pathetic\nin their tracking capabilities or they are very relunctant to share\ninformation. Surely one or two satellites would have picked up something that\nnight. Despite the limitations of tranponders and other tracking software,\nnothing simply disappears without a trace. On the IFE system on aircraft, you\ncan see the exact position of the aircraft as it continues on its flightpath.\nHowever, i would assume that this can be disabled or tampered with to avoid\npanicing the passengers. There was nothing out of the ordinary about this\nplane and it had an experience captain and first officer. Either something is\namiss or this is a very sad and tragic combination of coincidences and errors.\nAssuming that the Ocean Shield is actually listening to the MH370 pingers, the\nchance that they were so dead on in finding the correct location right off by\ncalculating the 7th Satellite ping is pretty improbable. In all likelihood,\nsomeone\u2019s \u201ctop secret radar\u201d or satellite date has put them on this spot.\nWhether it\u2019s US or Chinese information, or someone else, they don\u2019r want their\ncapabilities made public. But surely, there\u2019s some information flowing to the\nAustralians under the table.\nWhat if the plane is never found?? I mean until now we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even had a\nsingle sighting of any wreckage. The black box pinger\u2019s will run out in about\na day or so and without them the plane will become much more difficult to\nfind. I wonder if the rescuers will ever stop looking for it even if it takes\n5 or 10 years. If it is never found then it will become the greatest modern\naviation mystery ever. One criticism i do have is why the countries involved\nnamely India, China, US and Australia aren\u2019t deploying more assets in the\nregion? It took only one day to send warships to counter the Chinese offensive\nin the South China Sea. If the Chinese and US work together the plane could be\nfound today.\nAustralia\u2019s suggestion that they have to keep looking for the pinger is\nridicules. If the Ocean Shield is dragging a HIGH-TECH pinger locator at a\nwalking pace, and if detects a signal consistent with flight 370\u2026you are\nthere. It only has a range of two miles. Not sending down the ROV to that four\nsquare mile area defies explanation.\nYou know, it isn\u2019t like at 1.99999 miles you get a clear signal and at 2.00001\nmile suddenly it cuts off and you don\u2019t get a signal anymore. Also we don\u2019t\nknow what equipment or standards they use to say signals have a range of 2\nmiles. You can also factor in that some of the equipment the searchers are\nusing might be more sensitive and might detect a signal from longer distances.\nplease take the time to read the following article, though it may not seem\nfamiliar at first to you depending on your awareness as you read it in full\nyou will see the connections and possible evidence that leads to the possible\ntruth behind the missing flight 370, if you find this article truthful I urge\nyou to look deeper and share with others\nhttp://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1159-flight-370\nThree questions:\nIf transponders are easily interchangeable, plane to plane, it is even\npossible that the plane that was on the original ATC secondary radar wasnt\nMH370. That there is a two-minute space of time at the time right before\ndeparture that there was no contact and assumption that the plane which takes\noff with code sign of MH370 is actually MH370. And that this distraction plane\nhad to turn away from entering Vietnam airspace, because Vietnam would have\ncaught on to the fact that it wasnt a 777. There was one early report from\nMalaysian airlines on the first day that the plane never took off.\nGiven that pilot\u2019s flight simulator had a Diego Garcia landing, but since it\nis so top secret, how likely is it for these kinds of games to have such a\ndestination? For anyone out there who has flight simulator game, can you say\nhow common or easy it is to get Diego Garcia settings on your flight simulator\ngame? Are we falsely assuming that it is a landing spot whose details are\npublic information in games?\nFound a strange connection. So many techies on board, including 30 defense\ncontractors, one of whom is/was a China Telecom executive of China who had\njust participated in the C&MA (construction and maintenance agreement) signing\nfor Sea-Me-We 5, a submarine cable planned to run from Asia to Europe. And in\nthe recent past months, ASEAN Defense Minster Meetings and ASEAN Defense\nIndustry Collaborative were laying out an ASEAN defense minister-to-defense\nminister direct phone line (possibly through submarine cables) in the event of\nan emergency. Strange connection between so many defense contractors on board,\na kind of Southeast Asian military industrial complex in development, and the\ndefense ministers who had built up a direct working relationship. It is\npossible that there was desirable information or military technology on board.\nIt is possible that there were state secrets on board that would have made it\nto China if the plane wasnt stopped. Anyone see more to these connections than\nmere coincidence?\nI won\u2019t comment on your first paragraph since it\u2019s ridiculous conjecture with\nno basis in reality. The flight identified itself as MH370, no question about\nit.

The fact that something may (or may not) have been\non board doesn\u2019t mean a thing unless you have proof it was.\nAnd I\u2019ll stop here, I won\u2019t comment on the last two sentences in a futile\nattempt to keep myself sane.\nI think he meant secret documents that prove that Vaccines are a worldwide\nconspiracy and if they arrived to China and later disseminated they\u2019d have\ncaused the collapse of many pharmaceutical companies. While China comes out on\ntop since people would now depend on their traditional herbal medicines and\nthe world free from autism. That\u2019s why MH370 was \u2018disappeared\u2019. \ud83d\ude09\nBut an unidentified plane flying toward Diego Garcia would be considered as\nhostile just as any unidentified plane flying toward a US target would be \u2013\nCorrect? Unlikely the officials at Diego Garcia would have allowed it to land\nat Diego Garcia because there was no logical reason for it to be in the area\nand it would be too risky to whatever assets the US has on the ground at Diego\nGarcia- Correct?\nI have been doing some reading into what happens when aircraft stray into\nrestricted US airspace and the US is quick to take action in every case. They\ndo their best to ensure a good outcome for all but are clear that they won\u2019t\nstand for a plane heading for a major city or significant target. In the case\nof a big airliner, ridiculously off course with nowhere else to land in the\nIndian Ocean the US Military wouldn\u2019t have a lot of choices of what to do with\nthe plane \u2013 perhaps escorting it to a less perilous Australian airport when,\nsadly, the plane ran out of fuel well before making land.\nThis scenario would certainly explain the miracle of how the Australians\nshifted the search area and almost immediately were rewarded with the pings.\nAfter all, with almost 4 million dollars sunk into the search by the US\nperhaps it was time to put the charade of searching to an end by providing a\nlittle inside information. Kind of explains the lack of wreckage too \u2013 there\nwas lots of time to tidy up the surface before the search finally dropped to\nthe south.\nif plane crashed in ocean\u2026there would be some debris. alot. if shot down or\nbroke midair..somethings just do not sink. nothing has floated to any shores\nin 30 days\u2026as far fetched as seems\u2026plane landed somewhere for future use.\nif plane crashed in ocean\u2026there would be some debris. alot. if shot down or\nbroke midair..somethings just do not sink. nothing has floated to any shores\nin 30 days\u2026as far fetched as seems\u2026plane landed somewhere for future use.\nIt depends on ocean currents where it crashed if debri might ever reach some\nshore. If lucky it might reach a shore in 30 days like you said, or maybe like\nsome debri from the 2011 tsunami it took 2 years to reach a shore, or maybe\nnever like some pockets of plastic garbage in the oceans.\nSince we are exploring all possibilities \u2013 could anyone with technical\nexpertise hide in the avionics bay and create havoc from there? If this is\nwhere ACARS was disabled \u2026.\nA Chinese ship, the Haixun 01, has reported picking up some \u2018pings\u2019 in the\nsearch area.\nIt is not yet known whether this is related to MH370, but the nature of the\nsignal is such that a black box is suspected.\nI suspect a maintenance issue rather than pilot error but then my opinion is\nworth nothing. As always there will be a chain of events that lead up to the\naccident and this is now the most difficult air crash investigation to date.\nI hope enough of the wreckage is found especially the data and cockpit voice\nrecorders. We all need to know what went wrong so we can stop it happening\nagain.\nWith all these acronyms being thrown around, it is confusing.  \nI found this site which may be helpful if others are confused too:  \nhttp://www.aviationtoday .com/Assets/ACguide(1).pdf\nMy question: How are AWACS, ACARS and AHMS different in relation (or in\ncontradiction) to:  \n(1) data of the ping(s) that have been thus far reported?  \n(2) data of the last partial ping?\nTHANK YOU!!!\nPatrick\nTheories aside I have a legitimate question about something.\nOn FlightAware it shows outbound from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing information on\nconsecutive days for aircraft serial number 9M-MRO and 9M-MRQ but no return\nflights out of Beijing to any destination for these planes show up. However,\nFlighAware shows both of these planes flying out of Kuala Lumpur on the very\nnext day, 24 hours later, back to Beijing. There are other planes that show\nthis happenstance, but not many.\nI understand that the route identifier would change (9M-MRO is not always\nMH370) but the plane serial number ID for the transponder wouldn\u2019t change,\nright? 9M-MRQ is also shown flying into LA on January 27 but on January 29 it\nis departing out of Kuala Lumpur again without any flight information showing\nhow it got back home. I know part of that is time zones, but it seems weird\nthat it is tracked by the transponder leaving Malaysia but not returning.\nThere was no flight scheduled officially by Malaysia Airline from LA to\nanywhere for that plane.\nWould airlines fly a plane back empty and that is why they don\u2019t show up on\nFlightAware? It seems really expensive \u2013 would they fly it back with cargo\nonly instead?\nI don\u2019t think you understand how transponders work.\nTransponders do not identify a particular aircraft. They are not a fingerprint\nof a specific plane. They identify a FLIGHT, based on the four-number CODE\nthat the crew enters into the transponder. And that code is always different.\nAir traffic control identifies you via this code, NOT THE TRANSPONDER ITSELF.\nYou could swap transponders from plane to plane, flight to flight, and it\nwould make no difference. Your code is different, day to day, flight to\nflight.\nIn fact the code will often change OVER THE COURSE of a flight.\nThanks \u2013 the transponder thing seems complicated. Why does the code change\nover the course of the flight \u2013 is it geographic?\nWhat does 9M-MRO refer to? Is that specific to the plane itself or does that\nchange from flight to flight?\nI have really enjoyed reading your essays and your story about the exploding\ntoilet was pretty hilarious. You have a really great way of explaining things\nin an entertaining way. I am a nervous flyer and all of the information about\nturbulence really resonates with me. Thanks for that! My husband will be\nparticularly grateful to you next time we fly. \ud83d\ude42\n>> Why does the code change over the course of the flight \u2013 is it geographic?\nThat\u2019s the best way to describe it, yes. As you move from one air traffic\ncontrol sector to another, controllers will sometimes give you a fresh four-\ndigit code. Not always though\u2026 it\u2019s common, especially on domestic flights, to\ncomplete a whole flight without a code change. Other times, particularly on\ntransoceanic flights, your code might be assigned two or three times as the\nflight progresses. Over the ocean or when crossing other non-radar areas, we\ndial in a generic default code \u2014 \u201c2000.\u201d\n>> What does 9M-MRO refer to? Is that specific to the plane itself or does\nthat change from flight to flight?\nThat\u2019s the plane\u2019s registration. Think of it like a license plate. It\u2019s\npainted on the back of the fuselage. 9M is the prefix for Malaysia. (N is the\nprefix for the United States.) Registrations will often change over the course\nof a plane\u2019s lifetime.\nThank you. Wow -pilots have a lot to keep track of up there!\nIf you have a minute I have a couple of other questions\nWhat is code sharing. Is it something other than the code changes you\ndescribed or does it serve some other function?\nAlso, how do countries keep track of how to calculate overflight fees? Is it\nan honour system situation? I read some flights are a little longer because\nthey route out over water to avoid the fee?\n\u201cTransponders do not identify a particular aircraft.\u201d\nIf transponders do not identify a specific or particular aircraft, what does?\nThey identify whatever FLIGHT CODE you dial in. I\u2019m trying to make the point\nthat transponders are easily interchangeable, plane to plane.\nPersonally, I think it was some mechanical failure. I can\u2019t imagine a suicidal\ncrew member or passenger would fly the plane for hours before crashing into\nthe Indian Ocean. For what it\u2019s worth, I can\u2019t see any real alternatives to\nmechanical failure.\nHow do you explain the actual route changes after it turned around. If the\nproblem happened before they turned around and incapacitated them before they\ncould land why isn\u2019t the plane in the Andaman Sea, the Bay of Bengal or\ncrashed somewhere in India. That is pretty much where the plane was pointing\nafter the turn? Not sure if the fact that the plane made a nifty turn to avoid\nIndonesian airspace has been debunked but if not, how did that happen. And if\nnot that, how was the turn to the south made?\nYes Marie..my very same thoughts .If the Plane was on autopilot after it did\nthe sharp west turn ;does autopilot fly change directions ?\nStrange my comment regarding Diego Garcia is awaiting moderation\u2026thats never\nhappened on here before :/\nI read this from someone on another site its a very logical written piece:\nLook at nothing but the facts, strip away all opinion and gossip, and all\ntheory. Considering just verifyable data \u2013 factual data from the day and the\nfollowing day only:\nPubilic radar is consistent with the only reputable eyewitness, who saw \u201ca\nburning plane\u201d in the sky just NNE of where it was \u201clast heard from\u201d on public\nradar (like 5 mins after it disappeared from radar view).\nThen nearly a week later to this, media report on military analysis of\ncorporate satellite data that had become available all of a sudden; (This\nmeans the official statement concerning the military satellite data that\nnobody has as yet seen).\nThese military satellite reports cannot and must not be believed until there\nis hard factual evidence of it. The public radar data is the only universally\nagreed source of verifyable information, and so a factual investigator must\ndiscard the media gossip.\nSo what are you saying?\nThe closest I can decipher from your words is that the last bit of truth was\nleft for us over the South China Sea and/or Gulf of Thailand. Is that your\npoint?\nDiego Garcia is becoming more and more interesting\u2026\nThese 2 links I also find interesting  \nhttp://beforeitsnews.com/conspiracy-theories/2014/04/mh370-diego-garcia-calls-\nfor-empty-cargo-ship-for-travel-and-relocation-moving-bodies-2461392.html\nhttp://beforeitsnews.com/international/2014/04/ocean-shield-ship-searching-\nfor-mh370-goes-dark-where-is-it-2480232.html\nDiego Garcia. This US base has a lot of capabilities. Very advanced long-range\nradar for air defence, but also sensitive underwater listening to monitor\nsubmarine activities in the Indian Ocean. And lots of other communication and\nsurveillance systems. They would have detected MH 370, either as it flew into\nthe extended area around DG or perhaps even the noise from the 777 crashing in\nthe ocean. Strange that they have not made a statement.\nHere\u2019s something for the weekend, a theory that fits nicely (and if it\ndoesn\u2019t, just change it a bit):  \nThe plane didn\u2019t crash. Rather, it went through a time-space wormhole and\nmoved back in time four thousand years, flying to Beijing and crash-landing on\na field there. Consider how similar Beijing and Boeing are\u2026 777 is a lucky\nnumber for the Chinese\u2026  \nThe passengers and crew are revered by the locals, and with their gadgets and\nknowledge of technology, they create the Chinese civilization.  \nInstead of searching in the Indian Ocean, there should be full-scale\nexcavations done in Beijing to uncover the plane and, undoubtedly, the burial\ngrounds of the passengers.\nPretty encouraging numbers for the rational explanations, but at the same time\nnot. 1 in 10 thinks someone was able to land a big plane and hide somewhere,\nholding hundreds of innocent people for almost a month without any demands or\nreasons. And 1 in 20 thinks Aliens, Black Holes, Dragon Triangles or whatever\ntook the plane\u2026 Bring the iin hats!\ntin hats!*\nFirst of all, why would a captain, who has spent almost his entire life at the\ncontrols of an aircraft suddenly decide to commit suicide? His colleagues\ndescribed him as a quiet, passionate person who loved his job. I find it\ndifficult to understand why they would be so heavily demoised without any\nclear proof. The planes flight path also raises some questions. The plane had\nfirst ascended to 45,000 feet before descending to around 25,000 feet. In\norder to survive hypoxia the person in command would have needed to have\naccess to the oxygen masks and have guts of steel to fly through the most\ndangerous airspace in the world with a high chance of miscalcualtion by a hot-\nheaded military controller and get shot down. I think who ever did this was\neither doing it to test the South Asian air dfenses in preparation for an\nattack or or to send a political message. Nobody flys a plane into the ocean\nfor nothing. Maybe the North Koreans or Americans are involved in a this so\ncalled \u201ctragedy.\u201d All in all it may just be a classic case of human error or\ntechnological malfunction.\nThanks for the blog. More details about Airline courses\nhttp://www.kasturiaviation.com\nAssumptions:  \n1\\. The plane that was lost on primary radar was the same one that was picked\nup on secondary radar.  \n2\\. 100% belief in Inmarsat, even though there is a chance of error, and\nwithout any other competing view.  \n3\\. Plane ended in the Indian Ocean. Northern corridor search ended based on\n100% belief in Inmarsat.  \n4\\. Lives are lost without hard proof.  \n5\\. Focus on only four areas of possibilities \u2013 terrorist, hijacking, personal\nproblem, and psychological.\nPattern:  \nFirst stating conclusion and then search for and collect evidence that fits\nthat conclusion.  \nFirst limited parameter of possibilities, and not consider other\npossibilities.\nYou\u2019re wrong about the northern corridor assumption. It was finally ruled out\nas soon as all relevant countries denied the plane could have entered its\nairspace undetected by military radar. And don\u2019t give us any crackpot theories\nhow the plane was stealthy or how some countries didn\u2019t detect it. Thailand\ndoes not have OTH radar capabilities and their radar operators have been\nfoolish to have allowed an unidentified aircraft in their airspace and not\nraise any alarm.\nExcept would some bored radar tech watching so many commercial plane blips\nflying along the commercial corridor REALLY notice one extra plane. If you\nlook at the radar map it looks like there are 12 planes heading through that\ncorridor at any given moment even at that time of night. If MH370 didn\u2019t stray\noff the approved flight plan and if it stayed at 295 with it\u2019s transponder off\nit was more or less invisible to other commercial flight traffic and to ATC.\nReally, would anyone really have \u201cseen\u201d it? I doubt very much that the radar\noperators are looking for anything other than something deviating from the\npath or sneaking in another way. I doubt also they pay a lot of attention to\nchanges in flights due to weather, maintenance etc either, IF they even get\nthat information. I think the only reason the Malaysian military even took\nnote of it AFTER THE FACT when they were asked was that it was slightly\noutside the usual route. It wasn\u2019t until it reached the coastline that it\nwould have got in line with the others, virtually hiding in plain sight. If,\nof course, it didn\u2019t go south and get intercepted heading in the general\nvicinity of Diego Garcia and dealt with by the US as a hostile intruder.\nExcept would some bored radar tech watching so many commercial plane blips\nflying along the commercial corridor REALLY notice one extra plane. If you\nlook at the radar map it looks like there are 12 planes heading through that\ncorridor at any given moment even at that time of night. If MH370 didn\u2019t stray\noff the approved flight plan and if it stayed at 295 with it\u2019s transponder off\nit was more or less invisible to other commercial flight traffic and to ATC.\nExcept you\u2019re thinking about ATC. I specifically mentioned military radar.  \n1\\. You\u2019re assuming it was going along a commercial corridor. There is no\nindication that this happened in this flight.  \n2\\. The military do ignore all commercial planes, but one flying with its\ntransponder turned off should raise an eyebrow and YES, they WILL notice \u201cone\nextra plane\u201d if it\u2019s showing up as a huge red blip on their radar.\nThe plane did not identify itself as \u201cMH370\u201d on anyone\u2019s radar so it would\nhave been an object of interest to any radar operator. To do otherwise is\ndereliction of duty and as I mentioned, it\u2019s a grave offense in any military\nin the world. This will no doubt be downplayed and hidden, but I fully expect\nthe radar operators will be, or already have been, dishonourably discharged \u2014\nquietly.\nIf it went to Diego Garcia, it would have crashed some hour or two short of\nreaching the runway. End of story.\nActually, I did reference both. ATC wouldn\u2019t have seen the plane because no\ntransponder transmission and it was not flying a normal altitude so no other\nplanes would have eyes on it and Military radar did actually see it \u2013 the were\nsimply not alarmed by it because it was just another commercial plane flying\nanother commercial route. No one has been able to tell me if military radar\ntechs actually match up the little blobs flying along the commercial routes\nwith the flights, including delays or last minute schedule changes. Just one\nmore little blob flying along, not causing any trouble or cause for alarm. Go\nand have a quick look at a flightracker and you can see how easily this plane\ncould have just slipped into the stream considering the stream is pretty much\nright at the place where the plane went either North or South. Not hiding\nunder or over another plane, just cruising along with them. Remember, the\nMalaysians didn\u2019t even raise the alarm until long after this flight would have\ncrashed or landed so nobody would have been looking for one extra flight on an\nalready crowded commercial flight path. Nothing fancy. And this wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen a couple of guys acting alone either \u2013 there would have been people\nwaiting for it at the final destination because you wouldn\u2019t steal a 777 just\nfor a joyride. Plus, still no debris. 8 million people are searching on Tomnod\nand still nothing in the water. Granted, it\u2019s a big ocean but you would have\nthought someone would have identified something other than dead jellyfish and\ncast off fishing gear by now. But as I understand it now, the theory is that\nthe plane landed much like the Miracle on the Hudson except nobody got out of\nthe plane and deployed the life rafts so it just sunk, completely intact.\nHaving said that, based on the math and conjecture which has everyone\nsearching the southern Indian Ocean, although that shifts on the daily\nrecalculation of the suppositions, I still contend if an uncommunicative,\ncommercial airliner was heading generally in the direction of Diego Garcia or\nfor that matter, Australia, there would have been serious consequences. It is\ninconceivable that it could have slipped past a high-test military facility\nun-observed. And if it was observed what\u2019s the harm in saying where it is,\nunless of course, you put it there. That is a lot of ugly public opinion to\nwear no matter how you spin it. Also, current math has them searching beyond\nDiego Garcia on spec \u2013 what makes you think it crashed well before the island\nand why is the search not centered there? It\u2019s no wormhole theory I give you\nthat.\n> Actually, I did reference both.

So, let\u2019s say you want to bomb Bangkok. You just take a B-52, fly a\ncommercial route to Bangkok, drop your bomb load and nobody suspects a thing?\nGet serious. Not B-52? Take a 777 and fly it into a building (aka 9/11).\nYou\u2019re seriously thinking that a plane with a transponder off is \u201cjust another\ncommercial plane\u201d not worth investigating? You\u2019re deluding yourself to fit a\ntheory.\n> No one has been able to tell me if military radar techs actually match up\n> the little blobs flying along the commercial routes with the flights,\n> including delays or last minute schedule changes.

Those question marks are always of interest!\n> 8 million people are searching on Tomnod and still nothing in the water.\n> Granted, it\u2019s a big ocean but you would have thought someone would have\n> identified something other than dead jellyfish and cast off fishing gear by\n> now.  \nYou\u2019ve no idea. You really underestimate the scale of the search. Let me\nsuggest something to you: Go out and find a cricket in your city\u2019s lawns, but\ndo not look closely until you think you have seen one \u2014 then take a closer\nlook. But not instantly, but slowly, like take 10 minutes before you\u2019re close\nenough to see it. Chances are it will be gone. THAT\u2019s closer to the scale of\nwhat\u2019s being looked for in Tomnod.\n> But as I understand it now, the theory is that the plane landed much like\n> the Miracle on the Hudson except nobody got out of the plane and deployed\n> the life rafts so it just sunk, completely intact.  \nRidiculous. Hudson was still and the A320 is a narrowbody. B777 is a much\nlarger widebody plane and the only ever successful ditching of a smaller\nwidebody \u2014 a 767 \u2014 was performed eighteen years ago, and it was in very calm\nsea. To date, nobody else ever successfully ditched a widebody and certainly\nnot in the Indian Ocean while it was autumn and where waves are several meters\nhigh. The difficulty of this is unbelievable and simply descending onto water\nis not going to work.\n> Having said that, based on the math and conjecture which has everyone\n> searching the southern Indian Ocean, although that shifts on the daily\n> recalculation of the suppositions, I still contend if an uncommunicative,\n> commercial airliner was heading generally in the direction of Diego Garcia\n> or for that matter, Australia, there would have been serious consequences.\n> It is inconceivable that it could have slipped past a high-test military\n> facility un-observed.  \nIndeed. That\u2019s why it was never close to DG. Again, you\u2019re underestimating the\nsize of the Indian Ocean. Yes, it is smaller than Pacific or Atlantic, but it\nis still inconceivably huge. The plane had fuel to go to Beijing plus maybe\n400 miles. Where the plane deviated, there was ~700 more miles to DG than to\nPEK. How do you think it could have gone to DG on the reserves it had?\n> And if it was observed what\u2019s the harm in saying where it is, unless of\n> course, you put it there.

They revised their search area based on fuel\nestimates precisely because the first one was too far away for the plane to\nhave been there.\n> It\u2019s no wormhole theory I give you that.  \nI\u2019m seriously wondering if you didn\u2019t recognize the sarcasm there.\nYou\u2019re wrong about the northern corridor assumption.

Thailand\ndoes not have OTH radar capabilities and their radar operators have been\nfoolish to have allowed an unidentified aircraft in their airspace and not\nraise any alarm.\nThere is another assumption involved with accepting the southern corrider\nassumption:\nWe/you/media/authorities/everybody seems to ASSUME that all relevant countries\nare TELLING THE TRUTH when they denied that the plane could have entered their\nairspace. For example, if some state agency planned and paid for such a\nmaneuver, then why would we expect them to tell the truth and say that they\ndetected the plane?\nThere is another assumption involved with accepting the southern corrider\nassumption:\nWe/you/media/authorities/everybody seems to ASSUME that all relevant countries\nare TELLING THE TRUTH when they denied that the plane could have entered their\nairspace. For example, if some state agency planned and paid for such a\nmaneuver, then why would we expect them to tell the truth and say that they\ndetected the plane?\nBecause we\u2019re not talking about one country, but several. It would have been\nimpossible for the plane to get to China without flying through the airspace\nof several other countries along the way. At least one other country would\nhave detected it and they would have absolutely no vested interest in lying,\nsince they would be interested in uncovering the motives of the final\ndestination country.\nHold up a minute. There are several countries located on the northern corridor\nthat MH370 could access without flying over any other country. For example,\nthe most obvious would be northern Myanmar (Burma) which is a direct flight\ninto their airspace. Eastern Thailand is also on the northern corridor and\nthat\u2019s an easy zip-zag back in. Also look at eastern India (Aranchal Pradesh).\nSure, it could be a tricky flight path but you can get there flying only over\nIndia.\nFurthermore, it hasn\u2019t been confirmed that the westbound flyover of the Malay\npeninsula is really MH370. East of the peninsula, the following countries lie\non the Inmarsat ping map and are readily accessible via direct flight w/o\nviolating anyone else\u2019s airspace: Cambodia, Vietnam, & China\u2026as well as\nMalaysia (Borneo) and Indonesia (Borneo, Java).\nI\u2019m with you on the unreliability of the reporting of the truth from those\nnations. First of all they don\u2019t really want anyone to know what their\ncapabilities are, up and down the scale. Second, who wants to admit they were\nthe dummies who watched this plane fly right past them and didn\u2019t have the\nslightest idea it shouldn\u2019t have been there. Also, is every second of radar\ntransmission saved for later review? Can you actually go back and count the\nairplanes after the fact to see if there was an extra little blip? If not, do\nyou want to be the technician to tell your superiors that you really weren\u2019t\npaying that much attention? If you are that nation and you can rewind the\ntape, do you really want to tell the world that, your bad, you weren\u2019t\nactually paying that much attention? I would also guess there is some alarm\nthat gives you the heads up if somebody veers off the main path \u2013 I mean, your\nnew car can now tell you somebody has slipped into your blind spot so I would\nguess your radar system might not completely make you rely on your own keen\nfocus in the middle of the night, so really, do you actually need to count\nthem up ALL the time? After all, what are the chances that somebody was going\nto try to slip a big old commercial airliner past you in the middle of the\nnight\u2026. not possible. Right?

Plain and simple.  \nHowever, you are talking about countries that are in constant chaos and\nreorganization. This is a severe hamper to its normal operations.\n*) And even then, you can\u2019t presume too much. I mean, the Polish official (military) airliner crashes in Russia and the local government is upholding the official Russian version that has been proven, time and again, incorrect or flat out wrong on several key facts, it never launched an investigation of its own, leaving it all to Russians, and some of the people directly responsible for the disaster were promoted rather than discharged, so who knows?\nThere have been a number of smoke in cabin incidents involving 777-200er. From\nthe ones I was able to track down they start around 2011.  \nProbably the one that interested me the most was British Airways registration\nG-VIIF, flight BA-177 from Heathrow to JFK. Smoke in cockpit. Can\u2019t seem to\nfind the results of any investigation into that incident.\nJust the facts please (and dont call me Shirley):\n1\\. According to the new official transcript, MAS370 self identifies by voice\nas \u201cMAS 370\u201d but later when handing off from Lumpur Tower and Lumpur Approach\nchanges to \u201cMalaysian three seven zero\u201d \u2013 and after that the voice doesnt\nchange back or interchange those terms.  \nQuestion: Is it indicative of someone else communicating, or is it strange to\nuse one or the other terms?\n2\\. 20th minutes and 40th minute  \nI read somewhere that the cockpit is \u201csterile\u201d for the first 20 minutes of\nflight (sorry, I dont know what that means to be a sterile cockpit), and then\naccessible by the flight crew at the 40th minute. If this is true and we we\nlook at the time on the transcript, we can see that the 20th minute is between\nthe two redundant calls about FL350, and the then the so-called turning off of\nthe transponder happened right before or right after the 40th minute.  \nQuestion: Is there any clue here?\n3\\. There is the long silence between 01:01:19 when ATC tries to communicate,\nand 01:07:55 when MAS370 finally responds, however MAS370 had always been\nquick in earlier responses. This six minute silence sounds peculiar and could\npossibly be the time when any hijacking was going on.  \nQuestion: Aside from hijacking, what could the pilot have been doing to not\nrespond for so long? If one pilot was busy for example in the bathroom,\nwouldnt the other pilot be around to speak up?\n4\\. The Lumpur Radar (Area) transcript looks off. How is it that at 12:46:51\nboth MAS370 and ATC were talking at the exact same time? I guess they were\ntalking over each other\u2019s voice?\n5\\. Can a pilot sync up the transcript along with the flight radar, and see if\nanything seems off?\n6\\. I read about ACAR as well as another system called AHM, which sent out\npings for different things, ACARS for events like departure, cruising\naltitutde throttle back, and landing gear deployment. And AHM pings sent based\non regular time intervals, as opposed to being trigger by flight events. As we\nare being withheld information about all the pings, could it be that the last\nping and the last partial ping are representing different systems? Could it\nhave therefore be an indication of landing gear being deployed?\nThanks so much!\nSort of by accident I found a thread on a website where a professional pilot\nfrom Maylasia was asking for information on how to change the airplane\nidentifier in a 777 ACARS system. Although this is an old post, it is an\ninteresting question. Why would he want to do that? The URL:\nhttp://www.pprune.org/engineers-technicians/472227-boeing-777-acars-aims-user-\nguide.html\nAll I could find out about the poster was that he was from Malaysia and was a\nBMW enthusiast. I would think the FBI or another organization would want to\ncheck it out. Does anyone know how to communicate this to them?\nyou\u2019re right, that could be an intriguing line of inquiry. Then again, it is 3\nyears old.\nAbout that letter talking about tracking and as pointed out by you Patrick,\nplanes are already tracked and his argument is pointless anyways. Since you\nneed a system onboard the airplane to send data or status and those will\nalwasy have the risk of malfunction, damaged or tampered with. There are\npatents, proposals for systems like cloudsourcing where planes track or keep\ntabs on each other creating a network, but that won\u2019t change a thing since\nthose systems are onboard the airplanes and subject to the same risk as when\ntracking with VHF or satellite.\nAnd covering any comments asking if VHF/Sat fail, why radars can\u2019t keep track\nof planes over the ocean. It\u2019s because of the curvature of the Earth, once an\nairplane is a certain distance in the middle of the ocean thanks to the\ncurvature the airplane will be out of sight from the radar.\nAnd really with all this media coverage, the following acronym would be the\nmost fitting, MEDIA = Mass Erradicating & Destroying Intelligent Arguments.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nThese are a few weeks old but still in essence amongst the best articles I\u2019ve\nread about Flight MH370 and how poor journalism and the populist press\ninevitably perpetrates and thrives upon Chinese whispers \u2013 (no pun intended).\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/media-conspiracy-theorists-malaysian-airlines-\nflight-mh370?utm_source=vicefbuk\nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/how-does-a-plane-dissapear-martin-robbins-\nmh370-malaysia-airlines?utm_source=vicefbuk\nAt least the obvious trolling on here is in some way gratifying in that it is\nnot serious.

The \u201cuninterruptible\u201d autopilot would be\nactivated \u2013 either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or even remotely via radio\nor satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence\nAgency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck. \u00bb  \nDec. 21, 2006  \nBy: John Croft  \nWashington DC\n\u201chttp://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/diagrams-boeing-patents-anti-\nterrorism-auto-land-system-for-hijacked-210869/\u201d\n???????  \nU. S. Patent \u2013 Nov. 28, 2006 \u2013 No.: 7,142,971 B2  \n???????\nThat\u2019s still in the realm of science fiction. And if it turned out Boeing\nand/or US govt. can control planes remotely, you can rest assured every\nairline in the world would cancel all orders for Boeing aircraft and turn to\nAirbus.\nNot science fiction. The US used remote control to land pilotless planes on\naircraft carriers during atomic tests in the pacific in the 40\u2019s and 50\u2019s. In\n1984, the FAA did a remote control crash test of a Boeing 720. The 777 is a\nfly by wire aircraft, so remote control is a lot easier \u2013 all you need is\naccess to the flight computer which controls the plane.\nImpossible to hack a flight computer you say? Here\u2019s a BBC story:\n\u2018Security researcher Hugo Teso was able to \u201chijack\u201d the systems to feed false\nnavigation information to a simulated jet that made it change course.\u201d (April\n2013 \u2013 a year ago)  \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22107433\nSo if an amateur can do it with parts bought off ebay, what can the government\ndo with unlimited funding? Probably a lot more than most of us would care to\nknow.\nI\u2019m getting fed up with this stuff.\nAnd there is no such thing as a \u201cflight computer which controls the plane.\u201d\nPeople seem to believe in some proverbial \u201ccomputer\u201d that does all the work. I\ndon\u2019t understand what this is.\nAnd that Hugo Teso experiment, which I blogged about (see the blog archive),\nwas a contrived and controlled experiment. Regardless\u2026 it changed the plane\u2019s\ncourse. Big deal. The pilots would then change it back. Or they could ignore\nthe FMS and fly using basic course commands. Or they can disconnect the\nautopilot totally and steer by hand. And even if you could carefully control\nthe jet\u2019s course, speed, and altitude, and somehow couple it onto an ILS\napproach (this would entail hacking into several separate systems), you still\ncouldn\u2019t get the gear down or configure the thing for landing.\nAnd what exactly does any of this have to do with the Malaysia Airlines\nflight?\nI\u2019m getting fed up too, with silly statements like:\n\u201cno such thing as a \u201cflight computer which controls the plane.\u201d\nFly by wire has been around for some time.\n\u201cFly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight\ncontrols of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight\ncontrols are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the\nfly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the\nactuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response. The fly-by-\nwire system also allows automatic signals sent by the aircraft\u2019s computers to\nperform functions without the pilot\u2019s input, as in systems that automatically\nhelp stabilize the aircraft.[1]\u201d (Wikipedia)\nI don\u2019t quite understand why you would make such statements, but I suppose you\nhave your reasons.\nRight. Fly by wire basically replaces cables. But, the paragraph above, if\ntaken literally, does not mean what you _think_ it means. To the layperson it\nsounds pretty impressive, with phrases like \u201cflight control computer\u201d and\n\u201cautomatic signals,\u201d but you\u2019re not seeing the bigger picture. The 767 I fly \u2014\nan early-80s era jet without fly-by-wire technology \u2014 has three \u201cflight\ncontrol computers,\u201d none of which \u201cfly the plane.\u201d It also has the means to\n\u201cperform functions without the pilot\u2019s input\u201d such as trimming and speed\ncontrol when the autoflight components are engaged.\nNow, if you were really going to hack into a FBW system, about the best you\ncould hope for is rendering the plane uncontrollable more or less instantly. I\ncan\u2019t imagine there would be a way to steer or guide the plane with any\naccuracy. We\u2019re talking about basic maneuverability inputs to the ailerons and\nelevators.\nAnd if you could steer or maneuver with any precision, how would you then\ninterface these raw guidance commands with any sort of actual navigation or\naltitude changes? The FMS has nothing to do with any of this, so you\u2019d need to\nhack that too. Which wouldn\u2019t work, because the pilots can easily and\ninstantly disconnect everything from the FMS and use simple course (heading)\ncommands, either via an autopilot (I believe there are three autopilots on the\n777; same as the 767.) or entirely manually.\nAnd we haven\u2019t even gotten to power (thrust) control yet. Is the autothrottle\nsystem hackable too? Control over pitch and bank isn\u2019t going to be useful if\nyou haven\u2019t got control over thrust also. The autothrottle system is entirely\nseparate. And if it\u2019s acting weird, the pilots can simply switch it off. They\ncould also fight against any rogue control inputs \u2014 unless, somehow, you\u2019ve\ncompletely disconnected the steering column and trim controls from the FBW\nservos.\nAnd finally\u2026 you\u2019re going to somehow get this thing on the ground? How? Have\nyou also hacked into the LNAV function and the ILS frequency selector? And how\nare you going to adjust the flaps and slats for lower speeds, deploy the\nlanding gear, and so on? These are mechanical controls.\nDid it ever occur to you that maybe you\u2019re reading and hearing things out of\ncontext \u2014 simplified explanations and experiemental applications of\ntechnology, and that you\u2019re extrapolating unrealistically? Because that\u2019s\nexactly what you\u2019re doing. In terms of how planes actually fly, how the\nautomation works, and what pilots do, it\u2019s pretty clear that you don\u2019t know\nwhat in the world you\u2019re talking about.\nThat\u2019s not an insult. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to know or to really understand\nthis stuff unless you were a professional pilot.\nWhat is it that makes people such know-it-alls when it comes to flying?\nEveryone is a fucking expert, to the point where a non-pilot will actually\nargue with a pilot about the basics of flying. I\u2019m hardly the best or smartest\npilot on earth, but it took me 25 years to get where I am, and here I am being\ntold by people who don\u2019t fly, and who aren\u2019t pilots, how wrong I am about how\nplanes fly and what pilots do. I wouldn\u2019t claim to know how to perform brain\nsurgery, or how to operate a nuclear power plant, and even if I\u2019d read\nextensively about those topics, I doubt that I\u2019d go arguing with a surgeon or\na nuclear technician based on what I\u2019d read on Wikipedia.\nJust for starters\u2026 This patent was a basic prototype for something that is\nmany years from a useful or practical application, assuming it will find a\nuseful or practical application at all. The Boeing 777 was designed a quarter\nof a century ago.\nI very much appreciate the original piece, Patrick, and your attempts to\nfollow up with some of the readers who have been posting their crack-pot (and\nutterly misinformed) theories.\nBut I fear you\u2019re wasting keystrokes. There will always be a committed (with\nmembers who perhaps should be committed) group which will latch onto any\ninformational gap and fill it with wild imaginings. Nothing short of using\nsecret DARPA technology to imprint reality onto their brains will change that.\n\ud83d\ude09\nIf one was to believe in UFOs, there have been stories about huge mother\nships. Could one of them have hovered over the plane and sucked it up into\nit\u2019s cargo hold, then flown away? I am not trying to be sarcastic. But it does\nappear the plane just disappeared.\nThere\u2019s one problem with this theory: Where would the mothership come from? It\nwould probably have to be huge and it would release a tremendous amount of\nenergy that would be detected across the globe.  \nIf it came from outside the solar system and slowing down, it would be\ndetected as far as the Oort cloud, so we would know in advance we\u2019re having\nvisitors.\nNo, the \u201cone problem\u201d with this theory is that it involves aliens from outer\nspace.\nThe plane did not \u201cdisappear.\u201d It crashed into the ocean.\nIs it possible, that due to some technical problem, fire, smoke, or\nsimilar,the crew was incapacitated, the plane continued on auto pilot, and\nthen made a soft automatic landing in the sea without breaking up, similar to\nthe landing of the jet on Hudson River ? It would then sink slowly to the\nbottom of the sea, without leaving debris floating on the surface.  \nOr if it crash landed, could it break up in such a way, that the main fuselage\nremains intact, wings and engines breaking off, but everything sinks to bottom\nof sea without leaving floating material on top ?\nThe autopilot will not glide an aircraft and it cannot perform ditching. So\nrule out this possibility. Assuming the plane glides on its own, it will hit\nwater and to quickly summarize your theories:  \n1\\. Soft landing in rough ocean: Impossible.  \n2\\. Breakup into large parts. I suppose it could happen, but it would be the\nbest bet for the search operations.\nThird theory, however, is more plausible. When a plane runs out of fuel and is\nnot controlled, it will enter free-fall. There\u2019s no real terminal velocity for\nan aircraft, since it will disintegrate before achieving Vt. Therefore, the\naircraft will break up before hitting the surface at high speed, and this\nimpact will cause any large parts to break up into debris.\nNice comment about USA Today, which I have heard called USA Decay. When it was\nfirst created I immediately noticed its newspaper boxes looked like\ntelevisions. It\u2019s not the very last place I\u2019d look for facts but it\u2019s\ndefinitely well below average.\nI lean toward the Helios type incident if not deliberate intention (by the\npilot or co-pilot or a hijacker). But if the debris isn\u2019t found there will\ncertainly be a modest industry of science fiction writers coming up with\nfantastic explanations.\nI got sent this on email a few days ago I didn\u2019t know wether to laugh or\ncry\u2026..\nThis will be soon made into a film by Paul Greengrass with either Matt Damon\nor Mark Wahlberg in the lead.\nThere\u2019s a new conspiracy theory going around about the disappearance of\nMalaysian Flight MH 370. It goes like this:  \nWhen the Americans were withdrawing from the Afghanistan, one of their command\nand control systems (used for controlling the pilotless drones) was hijacked\nby the Taliban, while the American transport convoy was moving down from one\nof the hill-top bases. The Taliban ambushed the convoy and killed two American\nSeal personnel, seized the equipment/weapons, including the command and\ncontrol system which weighed about 20 tons and packed into six crates. This\nsupposedly happened in Feb 2014.\nWhat the Taliban wanted was money, by selling the system to the highest\nbidder. The Chinese were very eager for the technology. Just imagine if the\nChinese could master the technology behind the US\u2019s command and control\nsystem, rendering the American drones useless! The Chinese sent a team of top\ndefense scientists to check the system and then agreed to buy it from the\nTaliban.\nSometime in early March 2014, the Chinese scientists and the six crates of\nequipment made their way to Malaysia, thinking that it was the best covert way\nto avoid detection. The cargo was then kept in the Chinese embassy under\ndiplomatic protection.\nMeanwhile the Americans got the assistance of Israeli intelligence, and\ntogether they were determined to intercept and recapture the cargo.\nThe Chinese calculated that it would be safe to transport it via civilian\naircraft so as to avoid suspicion. After all the direct flight from KL to\nBeijing takes only 4 1/2 hours, and the American would not hijack or harm the\ncivilians on board. So MH370 was the perfect carrier.\nThere were five American and Israeli agents on board who were familiar with\nBoeing operation (the two \u201cIranians\u201d with stolen passports could have been\namong them.\nWhen Flight MH370 was about to leave the Malaysian air space and reported to\nVietnamese air control, an American AWAC jammed their signal, disabled the\npilot control system and switched over to remote control mode. That was when\nthe plane suddenly lost altitude momentarily.\nHow could the AWAC can do it ? Remember 911 incident? After the 911 incident,\nall Boeing aircraft (and possibly all Airbus) are installed with a remote\ncontrol system to counter terrorist hijacking. Since then all Boeings can be\nremote controlled by ground control tower. A similar remote control system is\nused to control the pilotless spy aircraft and drones.\nThe five American/Israeli agents soon took over the plane, switched off the\ntransponder and other communication systems, changed course and flew\nwestwards. They did not fly east to Philippines or Guam because the whole\nSouth China Sea air space is covered by Chinese surveillance radar and\nsatellites.\nThe Malaysian, Thai and Indian military radars actually detected the\nunidentified aircraft but did not react.\nThe plane flew over North Sumatra, Andamans, Indian ocean and then landed in\nthe Maldives (some villagers saw the aircraft landing). It refuelled and\ncontinued to Garcia Deigo, the American air base in the middle of Indian\nOcean. The cargo and the black box were removed. The passengers had been\neliminated through oxygen starvation. The MH370 with the dead passengers were\nthen flown (via remote control) and crashed into South Indian Ocean, making it\nlook like the plane eventually ran out of fuel and crashed, and putting the\nsuspicion on the captain and copilot.\nThe Americans put up a good show, first diverting attention and search efforts\nin the South China Sea while the plane was on its way to the Indian Ocean.\nThen they came out with conflicting statements and evidence to confuse the\nworld. The Australians were their accomplices.\nThe amount of effort put up by China, in terms of the number of search\naircraft, ships and satellites, searching first the South China Sea, then the\nMalacca Straits and the Indian Ocean is unprecedented. This indicates that\nChina was very concerned, not because of the Chinese civilian passengers, but\nbecause of the high value cargo and its eight top defense scientists.\nIncredible? Perhaps we will find out in a future episode of Wikileaks\nYou lost me four times.  \n1\\. When you mentioned that the Taliban somehow captured a drone control\nsystem. There\u2019s no such system, other than human pilots flying the drones\nusing standard military comms. True, the drones can be automated, but then\nthey don\u2019t rely on any signal from a base.  \n2\\. When you mentioned that the Chinese would master the technology behind\ncontrolling drones and making them useless. It\u2019s not like drones are some\nderelicts left behind by aliens that you would need to \u2018master\u2019 in order to\ncontrol them. They could just switch the frequency and encryption and call it\na day.  \nThen, I presume the control system is heavily encrypted and protected against\ntampering and any attempt to recover data from it would render it useless.  \nAnyway, I would actually expect the US to do two things in such a case. First\nwould be a new stuxnet straight at the military heart of the Chinese. Second\nwould be leading the Chinese to believe they can control drones remotely only\nfor the system to spectacularly fail when they actually use it in combat.  \n3\\. Remotely controlled airplanes. What a load of bollocks.  \n4\\. Eight top defense scientists. Those Freescale workers? Were they Chinese\nor American defense scientists after all? A suggestion: don\u2019t buy a new car or\nFreescale will remotely control it and drive you off a cliff in it to keep you\nquiet.\nIf you read my first line I said \u201cI got sent this and didn\u2019t know wether to\nlaugh or cry\u201d\u2026it certainly was not written by me and its not what I believe,\njust thought I\u2019d share.\nIn that case, laugh and then cry. And then change your e-mail address and vet\nthe people that you will inform about the address change.\nwhy?\n[IRONIC MODE = OFF] The fact that there is an unanswered question just means\nthat a question is not answered. Sometimes is our own ignorance, other that\nfor some specific reason/interest not all information is disclosed, etc. Of\ncourse, mystery experts, conspiracy theorists and priests dwell well on those\ngaps.\nThe apparent contradiction you mention, pings vs. velocity, to me (and I\u2019m not\nat all an expert so corrections are welcome) is not. You did not miss the part\nof the pings being absolutely identified with the missing aircraft, but you\ndid miss the part where the pings do not provide absolute aircraft position\n(otherwise most probably the plane would have been found already). Those pings\nindicate that the plane was within a satellite cell (how big cells are?\nprobably many miles). Such data comes from a single source (it cannot be\ntriangulated with another source for further accuracy and corrections) and\nfurthermore, estimated velocity is calculated using the Doppler effect. There\nis nothing wrong, the science is pretty sound on this, but again we are\nworking with estimates and ranges and not with absolute values.\nSo to me, there is no mystery or conspiracy on those calculations being\ncorrected or improved.\n[IRONIC MODE = ON]\nHard to know who out-stupids the other \u2013 CNN or USA Today. Is the following\nreally CNNs idea of breaking news and a developing story?\n**\u201cBoeing 777 Will Struggle to Maintain Altitude Once the Fuel Tanks are\nEmpty\u201d**\nNo idea if this photo is photoshopped or not.\nhttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/03/29/ru8ytesy.jpg\nI hate what passes for reporting in this mystery. We all heard about pings. I\nguess I missed the part about the pings being absolutely identified with the\nmissing aircraft. It certainly was assumed but I personally never heard it\nexpressed explicitly.\nNext we have the new search area based on new estimates of the speed of the\naircraft. Okay, flying faster, comsuming more fuel. How does this jibe with\nthe seven hourly pings reported? If it went down sooner than previously\nestimated are there now excess pings attributed to the this aircraft and what\ndoes that say about the new estimates? Again I have not heard any reporter or\nexpert comment on this.\nDana\nIs it possible that the main pilot had some kind of hallucination of entering\nthe earth at a specific point on the ocean floor. The Diamantina Fracture Zone\nin the Indian ocean where the search is focused on, has a clear \u2018X\u2019 marked on\nan otherwise flat ocean floor.Pilots are human and they are subject the same\nmental health issues normal people are.\nThis is the most logical theory I\u2019ve encountered. And it must be true, because\npilots are indeed human, aren\u2019t they. Since this sentence is true, the rest of\nthe paragraph must be also true.\nQuestions relating to the sudden loss of flight MH 370\n1.Could the pilots of a modern Boeing 777-200 get lost if their computer\nnavigation system suddenly failed in flight & could this explain why the plane\nturned around/got so drastically off it\u2019s intended course?\n2.could the pilots have been trying to re-boot the computer systems if the\ncomputer tried to send computer error messages and how long would this take to\nbe restored/recovered?\n3\\. could a 777-200 still fly on auto-pilot if the pilots were overcome by a\nin flight fire?\n4\\. if the flight crashed could the wreckage be at a depth of 20,000/30,000\nfeet in an ocean trench and if so how would the black boxes survive being\nsubmerged in a depth so deep & for how long?\n5\\. could the same/similar errors that downed Air France flight 447 have\nreoccurred in the case of the disappearance of flight MH370, And if so how\nwill the truth ever be known if they can\u2019t find the wreck site?\n6\\. how safe is the Boeing 777 series of airliner following the recent crashes\nof Asiana airlines flight 214 & British airways flight 38 & Malaysian airlines\nflight MH370?\n1\\. They would have to be really bad pilots for that to happen. They knew they\nwere on the right track, and if their navigation systems suddenly reported\nthey weren\u2019t, they would have been aware whether their plane was turning\nduring that time!  \n2\\. A pilot wold have to comment on this.  \n3\\. Yes. But if the course was not changed, the plane would have continued on\nto PEK and entered a holding pattern there. See Helios Flight 522.  \n4\\. Yes it could. Yes, the black boxes would be recoverable. See AF 447. FDR\nand CVR use solid state storage and they are remarkably resilient. Even old\nmagnetic tape was reliable in case of catastrophes, though. People have the\nmisconception that if a human being can\u2019t survive somewhere, any technology\nwill not survive these conditions, either.  \n5\\. Not really. Weather was excellent in their primary flight path, and even\nthough it was already autumn where MH370 is believed to be resting, if the\ncrew was disabled, the plane could not fly, etc., human error would not be a\ncontributing factor (as opposed to AF447).  \n6\\. It is still very safe. No fatalities in BA38 and its root cause was\nresolved. Asiana was caused by human error. Even if MH370 turns out to be an\naircraft malfunction, it is still very safe to fly (although Airbus A340 will\nthen take the crown of being the safest plane in civilian service). However,\nthis is just statistics. You can never rule out human factor and the fact that\nin some cases the passengers were just very lucky (e.g., the plane they took\nunexpectedly exploded the next day, luckily killing nobody), and the plane\nwill still retain its excellent safety record.\n1.Could the pilots of a mo\n1.Could the pilots of a modern Boeing 777-200 get lost if their computer\nnavigation system suddenly failed in flight \u2026?\nNo. There are procedures to follow if such a thing happened. And it would be\nvery unusual for there to be no secondary sources of navigation. In the area\nwhere the MH flight was last seen, there would have been basic VOR and other\nnav sources available. Worst case, even a total FMS/IRS/GPS failure over the\nopen ocean, we carry supplemental info that provides basic course\ninstructions.\n2.could the pilots have been trying to re-boot the computer systems\u2026?\nWhat does \u201cre-boot the computer systems\u201d even mean? A 777 isn\u2019t a MacBook Pro.\n3\\. could a 777-200 still fly on autopilot if the pilots were overcome by a in\nflight fire\u2026?\nI suppose it depends on the fire. It also depends what you mean by\n\u201cautopilot.\u201d People love lumping all of a plane\u2019s automation capabilities into\nthat one word.\n6\\. how safe is the Boeing 777 series of airliner following the recent crashes\nof Asiana airlines flight 214 & British airways flight 38 & Malaysian airlines\nflight MH370\u2026?\nWell, the 777 has been in service since 1995, and this is the first large-\nscale, presumably catastrophic event. And it may not have been an accident.\n3\\. could a 777-200 still fly on auto-pilot if the pilots were overcome by a\nin flight fire?\nThank you for the thoughtful analysis; I have both of your books. I recommend\nthem for anybody who flies. I am checking this site for updates, because the\nmedia is so d#%m stupid. It does seem clear that this flight is down, all\naboard lost, and I am sad.\nInteresting site, information and comments.  \nI have a question: if the plane turned around (effectively 180 degrees) and\nheaded south west \u2026 Surely it ends up flying over land again and into\nsomeone\u2019s airspace where it would have been picked up \u2026.???\nIt was picked up, but it caused huge embarrassment for Thai military whose\nradar picked it up. The plane did not turn back per se. It flew over Thailand,\nand even though it was detected as an unidentified aircraft, the air defense\ndid not act upon this. This is gross dereliction of duty and in some countries\nthis would result in years in prison for the radar operators.  \nPlus, their military radar coverage speaks volumes about their air defense\ncapabilities, which are apparently really poor.\nWhat was in the cargo someone did not want it to reach Beijing?  \nWhy China sent so many ships for SAR?  \nHow many Chinese Govt. tech. staff \u2013 Engineers / scientists on the flight?  \nWhat was the cargo?  \nThe flight had enough fuel 8Hrs to reach Diego Garcia and looks like it did\nhead there as the people of Maldives saw the low flying aircraft.  \nThe passengers and crew would have become unconscious if the flight was\ndeliberately plunged from above 30,000ft .  \nThe Hijackers with the unconscious passengers and crew could have flown it to\nDiego Garcia to unload a precious cargo.  \nThen refuel the aircraft and remotely control it to fly from there to remote\nIndian Ocean with timed explosives Where no one can find or salvage it.  \nBoeing/US Air Force has the capability of remotely flying aircrafts and Boeing\nEngineering has done it too.  \nThat is why US sent very little support for SAR. It must be the work of CIA\nthe creators of Osama Bin Laden.  \nTechnology wise who has the expertise to do this \u2013 US Defense.  \nSorry to the good citizens of US \u2013 THE COMPANY is capable of doing anything\nunder the sun being financed well without questions.  \nPity the souls of the dead \u2013 my deepest condolences to the aircraft staff and\nthe passengers. And nature will make someone pay by natural disasters. Its the\nrule of nature no nation can avoid. God Bless Their souls.\nAmazing what some people will do for a good mangosteen, huh? But seriously,\nlet\u2019s go over some of your assertions, since some of the points are pure\nspeculation, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to comment on them.  \n2\\. Well, ~160 passengers aboard were Chinese, Beijing was the destination and\nChina is the greatest local power, and the only one able to field so much\nequipment. More practically, this is an immense opportunity to practise and\ntest their maritime patrol skills.  \n5\\. Diego Garcia is 8 hours away, and the plane had 7h30m worth of fuel, less\nif you account for the hour that already passed, all under optimum conditions.\nDG is British territory leased out to USA, there\u2019s hundreds of people there,\nit\u2019s not like you can land a plane there without anyone knowing and rest\nassured there would be at least one whistleblower. Maldives are at least a two\nhour diversion away from DG. If the plane was flying low and over Maldives, it\nwould have never made the distance to DG, let alone Maldives.  \n6\\. Why would the plunge be necessary? And if the passengers and crew would\nbecome unconscious, why wouldn\u2019t it affect the hijackers? It\u2019s not like a 777\nhas provisions for plugging in a g-suit. Add to that the fact that a 777 is\nnot a fighter jet (gee, are you surprised?) and it\u2019s not designed to withstand\nsignificant forces acting on it. Passenger jets have been known to\ndisintegrate during uncontrolled descent and the scenario you are suggesting\nis worse for the airframe.  \n7\\. I can\u2019t even imagine why the hijackers would need to get people on board\nunconscious. If they managed to overpower all passengers and crew that would\nprevent them access to the flight deck and had nefarious motives, they could\nprobably kill everyone aboard with their bare hands.  \n8\\. Why refuel and fly out? Why not just cut down for scrap and and melt it\ndown? There\u2019s risk that it IS going to be found and that this ruse would be\ndetected. Why risk it?  \n9\\. USA has the ANZUS treaty and under its considerations, the Indian Ocean is\nAustralian responsibility. US has a token presence there and there are no\ncarriers available for an operation. What the US did send is quite a lot\nalready, though. P-8 Poseidon is just entering service with US Navy as the\nmost sophisticated ASW platform to date and is probably the best bet for the\nsearch. In fact, I\u2019m sure that Boeing would love to have this plane find the\nfirst actual debris from MH370 and put it in the limelight for finding it.\nThere, I just suggested another party to the conspiracy. Knock yourself out\ntying Boeing into your tapestry.\n[\u2026] turned off the transponder to be invisible to radar.\u201d Patrick Smith\nalready has taken apart much of the inanity of this \u201ctheory,\u201d but I\u2019m floored\nby the claims that turning [\u2026]\neverything points at the pilots. the flight path was apparently deliberately\nchanged at least 12 minutes before they made the last contact with ATC. so it\nhad to be one or both of them. the last known position of the plane is the\nmiddle of the Indian Ocean. there\u2019s only one scenario that fits: pilot\nsuicide.\nCheck this out ..\nhttp://au.ibtimes.com/articles/545653/20140329/malaysian-airline-\nflight-370-disappearance-boeing-777.htm#.Uzce1PmSxAo\nBasically it reads \u2013 the International Business Times reported that the\nbillionaire Jacob Rothschild ( Illuminati member )is now the sole owner of a\npatent semiconductor for Freescale, who had just happened to have launched a\nnew radar electronic warfare system days before Flight 370 vsnished.Four co-\nowners of the patent plus 20 employees, mostly engineers, were onboard, now\nmissing.  \nFreescale shareholders include Carlyle Group of private equity investors with\npast advisors including former US President George Bush Snr and ex British\nPrime Minister John Major.  \nCarlyle\u2019s clients include Saudi Bin Laden group company owned by the family of\nOsama Bin Laden.\n\u2026..Frightening connections but the debunkers I guess will continue to scoff\nand mock\u2026I would love to be proved wrong in my suspicions believe me!\nThat ridiculous assertion again?  \nDid you know Freescale is more than a defense contractor and that their\ndefense contracts are a tiny speck in their profits, with automotive\nelectronics being the greatest contributor of revenue?  \nRegarding FS employees on board, do you realize that to actually work in the\ndefense industry, the person must be cleared to work with top secret tech, and\nthat usually requires US Citizenship? I\u2019m not a US citizen, I work for a\ncompany that serves defence contractors and US military, and I can\u2019t even take\na glimpse at their service requests, much less check any details, and you\u2019re\nsuggesting a foreign national would work on military technology? On what\nplanet?  \nDid you even read the patent? Do you know what it entails?  \nThe patent is for a new method of laying out dice on a silicon wafer to\noptimize the number of obtained circuits. It\u2019s not rocket science and the\npatent is one of many methods that you can apply mathematics to the question\nof the optimal layout.  \nSecond, do you realize that Freescale had full rights to the patent one way or\nanother? The four Chinese inventors named in the patent are not its owners!\nThe assignee, Freescale, is. Furthermore, all technology companies protect\ntheir assets by requiring all inventions patented by the employee during his\ncourse of employment to be transferred fully to the employer (which usually\nentails a monetary reward).  \nThe deaths of these passengers changes nothing in terms of patent ownership,\nlicensing or allowed usage.  \nThird, there\u2019s no certainty that any of the four inventors were actually\naboard MH370, even though you can match their names with the manifest.\nHowever, the manifest makes no mention of the employer whatsoever. With over a\nbillion Chinese people, you would expect some of their names to duplicate. In\nfact, due to their naming conventions, there were no fewer than 5 individuals\nwith exactly the same name on the plane!  \nWhat\u2019s frightening is that some people will believe any ridiculous conspiracy\ntheory that fuels their paranoia.\nPossible scenario:\nAs the flight cross the south china sea ..  \n1\\. some people emerge from the flight saying they are from CIA and wants the\ncaptain and copilot to move away and they take control because the plane has X\nin it . Given the gravity of the situation the crew agrees\n2\\. A highly trained fighter pilot(or group) turns of all communication\nsystems and takes the plain to a secret facility without anyone being let\nknown .They make sure to make the least noises in any radars\n3\\. The one thing they forget is the hourly ping tracked by the UK based\nprivate company .\n4\\. The plane is either destroyed or taken to an unknown airstrip or military\nbase\n5.US joins the rest of the world for a massive hunt..while they know what\nreally happened . One must notice that satellite data about possible debris is\ncoming from nations like china,japan ,UK and even Indonesia and no such info\nfrom a country who probably owns and operates the largest number of\nsatellites! .\n6.US send in highly trained FBI agents with a secret motive to sabotage the\ninvestigation with false data or know how much the investigations by the other\ncountries are progressing\nIs it possible that the main pilot had some kind of hallucination of entering\nthe earth at a specific point on the ocean floor. The Diamantina Fracture Zone\nin the Indian ocean where the search is focused on, has a clear \u2018X\u2019 marked on\nan otherwise flat ocean floor.Pilots are human and they are subject the same\nmental health issues normal people are.\nGreat article. It\u2019s sad how many people are so willingly being mislead by\n\u201cexperts\u201d showing up on CNN, Fox, etc. Ignorance is running riot.\nMy approach to this is more about removing what didn\u2019t happen based on the\navailable information rather than attempting to determine what did happen\nwithout information. Personally, I think there is a lot to be determined from\nwhat initially occurred around the Malaysian peninsula.\nEvents that were dismissed by Malaysian authorities even when they happened\nand have not been revisited since are important. Firstly, around 8 separate\npolice reports of a low flying large aircraft were made by locals around the\n1.20am time at Marang Beach on the east coast of Malaysia and a couple more at\nBachok beach, around another 150km north. I see these events as rather\nsignificant as they suggest that the plane flew directly back down its initial\ncourse from the IGARI waypoint to KLIA, then at the coast line turned right\nand flew in a north westerly direction to intercept a vector between the IGARI\n\u2013 VAMPI waypoints before continuing on the already identified VAMPI, GIVAL,\nIGREX path before turning south. The interesting aspect here is that to fly up\nthe east coast of Malaysia would be fundamentally a manual task as there are\nno waypoint to track to or from. I would also suggest that as the plane was\nalready much closer to KLIA than Langkawi there was no attempt to get the\nplane down due to some structural event. Even adding to the Canadian pilot\narticle where he suggested that the plane would have gone for Langkawi as the\nterrain was lower is false. The geographical elevation along a vector from\nIGARI to Langkawi is almost identical to one from IGARI to KLIA, and KLIA\nwould have much better support for an emergency. So I would suggest the path\ntaken would indicate nothing critically wrong with the plane that needed\nimmediate attention or disabled the pilots or systems.\nFurthermore, for a flight that turned so far south, the route taken around the\nMalaysian peninsula strongly indicates a deliberate intention to be avoided.\n1) it crossed the peninsula at the Malay, Thai border which, would tend to not\nalert the ATC of either country, then proceed to make a very wide berth around\na very active surveillance of Indonesian airspace. All up, very deliberate and\nwith a fully functional plane.\nSuicide of the pilot would also seem something to be ruled out. Far too\ncomplicated a flight path and avoidance of detection for someone interested in\nending it all. Someone with grown children who most likely would not wish a\nlegacy of his actions to forever remain with his children. At his age, people\nmellow out. You have strong views and persuasions but tend not to be so intent\non such drastic actions. As for being a strong supporter of the Malaysia\nopposition; many Malaysian would be strong supporters and want to see an end\nto the cronyism and corruption that exists today; and anyone who attended\nAnwar\u2019s trial would not have been surprised at the decision albeit\ndisappointed. If you were to make a political statement with the plane, there\nare some much better places you could have crashed the aircraft to get\nattention.\nSo a quick summary, for me, is that there was nothing wrong with the plane ad\nit was deliberately flown where it went, and the pilot was not responsible for\nany suicide mission. Beyond that, it just becomes theories and guesses but I\nwould have to lean strongly to a suggestion that the plane was not flown (at\nleast voluntarily) by the MAS pilots, and with no motives coming forward there\nis only speculation. My curiosity is leaning toward an interest of \u201cwhat\u201d\nmight have been on the plane\u2026\nAnyway,through all this media mania, I keep thinking of the Lin Biao\n\u201cincident\u201d (crash) back in 1971\u2026\nAnd it doesn\u2019t look like Ukrainian Navy dolphins will be employed.\nSometimes it\u2019s all very sad.\nI don\u2019t get it, that they can\u2019t even find the smallest things. It\u2019s like the\njet just vanished into thin air, and what about the passengers? You would\nthink they would find something. To not find anything at all yet, seems really\nstrange to me.\nThe news this morning (3/28) carried a story that the search area was being\nadjusted northward because \u201cthe plane was flying faster, therefore using more\nfuel, therefore must have run out of fuel sooner\u201d.\nLike all of the statements made about this flight, it makes little sense. It\nran out of gas sooner, but still stayed in the air as long as previously\nestimated!\nIt seems that most of the flight information used in the search came from the\nsatellite pings. Reading previous posts here, there seems to be a lot of\nmisinformation about these pings. First, these pings were initiated by the\nsatellite, not the satcom tranciever in the plane, and are evidently done on a\nroutine basis by the satellite to see who is out there. According to news\nreports the satellite company provided airplane position data based on the\ntime between the ping being sent out and the reply from the airplane, as well\nas doppler information from the reply.\nI have been unable to find ANY detailed engineering description of how this\nwas accomplished. Presumably this information was recorded, since the analysis\nwas not completed for a couple of weeks. As an engineer, I would ask the\nfollowing questions:  \n1\\. What was the accuracy and granularity of the time measurement of the ping\nresponse time in the satellite?  \n2\\. What time assumption was made about the response time within the satcom\nreceiver between when the ping was received and when it transmitted a reply?\nWas it based on the exact model number of the system in the plane?  \n3\\. How did you measure the doppler shift and what is the accuracy of that\nmeasurement?  \nNote that there would be a tolerance assocuated with each of these questions.\nI don\u2019t know what these tolerances are since they have not been stated, but if\nthere is any sloppiness at all, the results would be indeterminate. For if the\ntolerance of 1 is +- 1 millisecond, and the tolerance of 2 is +- 1\nmillisecond, making the total round trip tolerance +- 2 milliseconds, then the\nplane could have been anywhere, since the positional error would be more than\n1000 miles per millisecond. Also the doppler shift would depend on the\naccuracy of the frequency source in the transponder.\nIf anyone has seen a technical description of the satellite ping data I would\nappreciate a reference to it.\nAnother problem is the rumor, started by CNN, that the aircraft had gone down\nto an altitude of 12,000 ft. Has anyone confirmed this?\nThe catastrophy theory seems to rely on the fact that some failure disabled\nthe transponder and ACARS system, while not affecting the autopilot. While a\nproperly trimmed aircraft could maintain roughly the same altitude for 7 hours\nwithout an autopilot, it would wander in direction.\nSo many question, no answers.\nIn the case of the flight M370 some explain the loss of flight instruments as\nthe transponder by fire. This fire is even responsible for the asphyxiation of\nthe crew.\nThe case of Malaysian flight reminds the tragedy of Helios airline flight .\nThe plane due to loss of pressurization became a ghost plane because all the\ncrew fainted. He crashed an hour after when he reached the end of its fuel.\nThats nobody understands for the flight M370 its why there has been\nsimultaneous loss of the instrumentation as the transponder with what could be\na loss of pressurization. Also why an electrical problem. This is why we talk\nof fire.\nWhats nobody has mentioned so far is that all electrical equipment is designed\nto operate at a certain air density, for ensure his cooling.\nA passage to the pressure altitude level 350 for which he is certainly not\ndesigned could have produced malfunctions by simply overheating.\nAs your computer can not work to its full potential if it loses his\nventilation.\nIt should be noted in this respect that the fans have been in Helios flight\ndeclared unserviceable certainly by early 4000 m not because they stoped but\nbecause they loss their cooling ability due to the low air density.\nIf electrical equipment are designed to be operated at an air density of 35\n000 ft , i am not sure.\nLaurent Gambourg\nIts been stated many times that the massive altitude change to 45,000 feet is\nan unreliable fact based on an inherent weakness of land-based radar over 200\nmiles away. But even if MH370 did change elevation, the transponders somehow\nlost power prior to the aircraft\u2019s climb.\nThank God finally CNN cleared the mystery out. The plane was sucked by a black\nhole. Probably one of those the so-called scientific are trying to create at\nthe CERN escaped without anyone to notice and runs free around the atmosphere.\nWe all pray that next thing the black hole sucks its CNN.\nIs it possible that the main pilot had some kind of hallucination of entering\nthe earth at a specific point on the ocean floor. The Diamantina Fracture Zone\nin the Indian ocean where the search is focused on, has a clear \u2018X\u2019 marked on\nan otherwise flat ocean floor.Pilots are human and they are subject the same\nmental health issues normal people are.\n\u201c\u2026there is simply no way to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane.\u201d Nonsense, not true, and you know it.\nRemote control of aircraft has been around since WW2 if not before. FAA used\nremote control in a crash test of a 720 (in 1984!).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWuvGoKdWFM\nThe capability to remotely take over a distressed aircraft is built in to the\n777.  \nEasy to do with a fly by wire aircraft.\n\u201cAll we know for sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or\ncommunication from the crew.\u201d Well no, we do know a lot more \u2013 and we know\nthat something stinks.\nA lot of shippers now use battery powered GPS trackers on cargo shipped by\nair, and passengers can buy inexpensive GPS trackers for their luggage. I\nwonder how many such GPS trackers were on board the airplane? Not only that,\nthe engines had GPS too. So the position was known, at all times. I wonder\nwhere the trail of bred crumbs lead?\n(Male airport in the Maldives is on Malaysian Airlines Route Map. It is within\nrange of the plane. The plane was sighted there at a time consistent with a\nflight to that area.)\nCommercial fleet vehicles like trucks use GPS trackers as well, providing\nmanagement with real time positioning data and messaging services. Hard to\nbelieve airline management hasn\u2019t equipped their fleet of multi-million dollar\nplanes with these inexpensive gizmos. If I were running an airline, I\u2019d sure\nwant to know where my planes were. UPS already uses this system on there fleet\nof aircraft. Hard to believe Malaysian airlines doesn\u2019t have something\nsimilar.\nTo say we don\u2019t know where the plane went and where it is now is not credible.\nProbably at least one passenger\u2019s family in China activated a GPS luggage\ntracker and got a signal that gave the lie to all the denials and we don\u2019t\nknows by the officials. (Maybe that\u2019s why they threw the water bottles) The\npeople a Rolls Royce know, as does Boeing, and a lot of others.\nI don\u2019t know what happened to the plane or where it is now, but the ever\nchanging official story does not add up, and neither does this story.\nYes, something stinks indeed. What they don\u2019t talk about is what invaluable\ncargo loaded into that plane. Something important, very important, probably\nclassified. Rolls Royce knows, Boeing knows, who knows who else knows.\nThe plane is fully computerised, and we all know we can install a trojan in a\ncomputer and then take control and divert.In order to install the trojan, you\nneed access to the airplane computer systems. Hence, we are talking about an\ninside job. Inside Rolls Royce, inside Boeing and may be others.\nQuestion is once they\u2019ve took control of the plane and the released the virus\nto knock-out everyone, how to unload the valuable cargo. This is easy to do,\nit is indeed being done since WW2 is being done, and you know it if you\u2019ve\nwatched enough Steven Seagal movies. After that the plane was left with the\nautopilot to its fate.\nUnfortunately, the trojan has probably been programmed to simulate a fire on\nboard, overwrite the black box and immediately erase himself with out any\nclue.\nSo we will never, ever, ever know the whole truth of what happened.\nJust to make it clearer..( am tired )\nLast contact was at 1.21am. Add 41 min flying time to reach original departure\nplace. Now add the 4 hours 24 min..\n1.21 plus  \n0.41 plus  \n4.24  \n\u2014\u2013  \n6.26 am\nUncanny eh\nThe Flight to Beijing was 6 hours, but the plane had 7+ hours of fuel on\nboard; I\u2019ve even heard as much as 8 hours.\noops..typo error.\nFlight370 departed Kuala Lumpa at 0041am, last contact at 0121hrs.  \nI think the math still holds up..\nFlight 370 had enough fuel to go from Malaysia to China = 2628 miles  \nTherefore it would have had enough fuel to reach Diego Garcia = 2617 miles,\njust south of the Maldives.\nPlane resembling Flight 370 reported heading south over the MALDIVES.  \nTomnod satellite imagery given to public to search, never once covers Maldive\narea, despite possible sighting\u2026.why ?  \nFlight 370 leaves Malaysia at 1.21am, flies for 41 min before losing contact.\nIt is 4 hours 24 min flying time from Malaysia to the Maldives. Add those 41\nmin to 4 hours 24 min, and you get 5.05am.  \nNow add 0505 hours to departure time of 1.21am.  \nYou now have 6.26am\u2026\u2026\u2026sighting at Maldives approx 6.15am.\nDiego Garcia is a TOP SECRET US Military Base leased from the UK, just south\nof the Maldives.  \nIf a Faraday cage was used to stifle electric fields, then cell phones and GPS\nwould not be getting or receiving signals.  \nMalaysia is unwilling to disclose details of the cargo onboard.  \nFlightradar have altered mapping of the Flight370 flight\u2026do some research, go\nto Youtube and start digging.  \nThey won\u2019t find plane debris in the ocean IMO\u2026the plane is elsewhere.\nSo US special operatives kidnapping planes full of passengers land it at the\nMaldivas for secret plot to brainwash them for some manchurian candidate or\nerase their memories, so they can fill the plane with chemtrail chemicals and\nfly it back to China?\nOMG I need a new supply of tinfoil hats!\nCan\u2019t people find a simpler explanation? Like there are thousands of planes\nflying over the sky, why can\u2019t it be any other plane flying over the Maldives.\nBut no, to conspiracy theorist it can\u2019t be any other thing than MH470, it must\nbe MH470.\nDiego Garcia, not the Maldives. Cargo unknown.\nWell hope you are right and me, along with many others are wrong in our\nthinking.  \nI keep forgetting how upfront and honest our Governments are!\nFOX, CNN and other news channels are obsessed with mystery of 370 but very\nlittle attempt is made by commentators to try to combine known facts in a\nmeaningful way. Here is one of attempts to find possible clue what can\nactually happened.  \n1\\. It is low probability of terrorist act \u2013 nobody claimed anything or\ndemanded. But can be \u2013 nobody took responsibility for 9/11 as far as I know.  \n2\\. Low probability of fire \u2013 it happens fast and plane cannot fly 5-6 hours\nafter. Lithium battery hypothesis does not stand by this reason too.  \n3\\. What else? What if that plane was transporting something or somebody\nillegal \u2013 call it \u201cimportant cargo\u201d. It eventually was worth more than 200\nlives.  \n4\\. Pilots were most probable accomplices and could agree to cooperate with\nsome criminals. Check if any of their relatives will become rich in a near\nfuture. All action was planned and 1st pilot had prepared on himself on\nsimulator \u2013 operation and flight were non trivial. Look if any other passenger\nwas trained pilot to disprove this idea.  \n5\\. What happened? As soon as Malaysian air control area was left pilots\nturned the plane back across Malaysian peninsula but above Thailand (plane was\non radars). Somewhere in Malacca strait there was a ship waiting for the\ncargo. Cargo was dropped with parachute or on a raft. That is why plane\ndescended to 12000 ft to be precise and find the ship. Then pilots turned\nautopilot on, programmed flight direction to the most lonely part of Indian\nocean, said goodbye (second time) and jumped from the plane on parachutes.  \n6\\. Altitude was set back high (or very high to avoid meeting other planes) to\nensure flight to last as long as possible until fuel ends. That is why plane\ndebris was found \u201cnowhere\u201d.  \n7\\. Option: 2 Iranians with false passports had finished pilots at the last\nminute and jumped themselves. Their eventual role was controllers and pilots\nprobably did not know about them. It is very naive to think that Iranians were\nrefugees: they can travel to Europe with Iranian passports freely directly\nfrom Dubai or whatever and will be welcomed in Europe as refugees with all\npossible perks. Need full search about them, history, connections, etc. It is\nquite possible that mother in Frankfurt will find her son alive sometime\u2026  \n8\\. Important Clue: about 5 passengers who decided \u201clast minute\u201d not to fly\n370 and their luggage was unloaded from the plane following regulations. Need\nto check them very thoroughly. Their decision is possibly a planned action and\nthe best way to place \u201ccargo\u201d on the plane. People who were sent to unload\nluggage could be accomplices and brought the cargo in their vehicle and were\nnot observed or passed security check. It is possible that few of them\nactually stayed in the cargo deck during the flight and helped to discharge it\n(drop out), also bring parachutes. Would be very desirable to find who\nactually brought the luggage back to the airport to these 5 people.  \n9\\. Try to restore ship routes in Malacca strait during this night. Those who\ndid it were in a hurry and did not fly too far from Thailand shore. There\ncould be fishermen who saw some ship or speed boat and plane or paratroopers.\nProbably pilot called to this ship on his cell 8 min before the flight when\nthe \u201d luggage team \u201creported success. Unfortunately Malacca strait is a very\nbusy route, but whoever planned the operation new about it: the ship in such\ncase does not need to deviate much from its course that can attract attention.  \n10\\. Need actually some hypothesis about cargo: drugs, nuclear weapons,\nmaterials, parts? What can Malaysia produce? Otherwise could be transit.  \n11\\. Sorry about passengers \u2013 they probably did not understand anything for a\nlong time. There was no need in fire or any depressurization: it could quickly\ndamage the plane but criminals wanted to push the plane as far as possible\nfrom the scene.  \n12\\. Cargo could be a human or one (more) of the passengers. Check If there\nwere any \u201cimportant\u201d people on this plane?\nUnfortunately for all of us, there is precious little value in your wordy\nspeculation. Your 12 numbered items point to 3 pretend situations (parachuting\npilots, \u201cimportant cargo\u201d, and Iranians). Any of us could sit around and make\nup 100 other possibilities that are all equally as (un)likely.\nThe stated facts about your \u2018important clue #8\u2019 were quickly modified over 2\nweeks ago. The official report was revised from \u201c5 people did not board (and\ntheir luggage was removed)\u201d to \u201c5 people who did not check in.\u201d That suggests\nroughly ~ 2% of the passengers didn\u2019t show up for a midnight, red-eye flight.\nThat is an entirely believable rate. Because of it, airlines have compensated\nby routinely over-booking flights and forcing paying passengers to be placed\non a waiting list. Apparently 4 of those 5 seats were gobbled up by passengers\nwho were flying on stand-by.\nYou did write 1 lucid thought that might point to a motive. Authorities need\nto know WHO and WHAT was on the plane; the answers might point to some\nmotivation for someone. They have released the passenger list and have started\nworking to discover which of these people were more than just names on a list.\nThere might be some connections/relationships that haven\u2019t been publicly\nreleased.\nInvestigators have also examined the cargo manifest. They told us about\nlithium batteries, but there may be other undisclosed cargo that intrigues\nthem as well. People sitting at homes on their computers guessing and\ninventing scenarios don\u2019t really help anything\u2026\nWhy not send aircraft carriers with helicopters and drones to scan the\npotential areas for debris?  \nAlso, has Malaysia sent aircraft or ships to assist in the search?\nThere is no wreckage, no bodies, as I expected by now they would probably\nfake, maybe yet to come, and no real good explanation that makes any sense out\nof the known circumstances of the disappearance of this plane. I am very\nsurprised at the ridiculous theories and senseless explanations that people\ncome up with and fail to see the most obvious simple explanation accounting\nfor all the known circumstances. First-off he truth is that even with todays\npublicly known technology, not to mention secret military technology and\nsurveillance, something like this could only be an inside job. The reason for\nthe pilots eerie calmness as he said goodnight, his last known audible words,\nis easily explained by the fact that he had no idea what was about to happen,\nas just after saying goodnight the transponders, all communications, and any\nother precautions that would have been in place, along with complete control\nof the plane were all remotely cut-off and taken over, this is why we could\nnot hear his distress calls or attempted communications as the plane then\nrapidly ascended, as was originally confirmed, and then was remotely\ndepressurized quickly killing everyone on board before descending and being\nremotely guided drone style in to wherever it is now, likely in preparation\nfor step #2, something we have known for a long time is our greatest danger\nfor which we are all currently sitting ducks, a sneak nuclear attack on the\nUnited States by commercial airliner. A much greater threat than even the best\nintercontinental missile ever made, as especially in the hands of such a\ncriminally genius, meticulous, technologically advanced organization able to\npull-off what they have already done, it can reach anywhere in the world, fly\nstraight through missile defense systems without appearing as anything\nunusual, and deliver any desired payload or weapon of mass destruction with\npinpoint accuracy to any target without us even knowing what\u2019s coming until\nit\u2019s too late. Almost, if not all of the media is either owned by, or\nsponsored by corporations owned by the most evil elitists and institutions in\nthe world who would like us think of something else, and be ignorant to the\ntrue magnitude of the danger that we are in the midst of, and who surely would\nnot hesitate to attack our own people in order to quell the building uprising\nand anger over what our corporate controlled government is doing to us, and as\nan excuse to launch a devastating war which would generate massive revenue for\nthe multi-billion, if not trillion, dollar weapons industry, and more\nspecifically the relentlessly greedy evil institutions who have more control,\nif not nearly complete control, power, and proportionately much more money\nthan ever today who own our politicians, control our government, and just as\nthey have been shown throughout the history of war to do, would as always,\nbenefit hugely from it.\nThis letter is a very good and very distressing example of a type of thinking\nthat has become pervasive.\n\u201c\u2026.I am very surprised at the ridiculous theories and senseless explanations\nthat people come up with and fail to see the most obvious simple explanation\naccounting for all the known circumstances\u2026.\u201d\nMe too. And that simplest explanation is a crash into the ocean.\n\u201c\u2026.the truth is that even with today\u2019s publicly known technology, not to\nmention secret military technology and surveillance, something like this could\nonly be an inside job\u2026.\u201d\nThis is simply false.\n\u201c\u2026.and being remotely guided drone style in to wherever it is now, likely in\npreparation for step #2\u2026.\u201d\nThere is no way in a million years to remotely pilot a Boeing 777 or any other\ncommercial plane. I\u2019m frustrated by how often this idea is suggested. Remotely\ncontrol it _how_? People seem to have a vastly exaggerated idea of how modern\njetliners are flown \u2014 that is, they vastly exaggerate the capabilities of\ncockpit automation, and what a person with access to this automation, whether\nfrom inside or outside the plane, would be able to do. You _cannot_ fly a\njetliner by remote control, period. This is made worse by a media that has no\nidea what it\u2019s talking about, and that loves to drag out \u201cexperts\u201d who\nsimilarly know very little about the realities of commercial flying, and who\nwind up propagating these crazy theories.\n\u201c\u2026.something we have known for a long time is our greatest danger for which we\nare all currently sitting ducks, a sneak nuclear attack on the United States\nby commercial airliner\u2026.\u201d\nAs I ask in the story (I\u2019m beginning to realize that most of the people\nleaving comments have not actually read the post they are commenting on),\nputting aside the exceptionally difficult task of stealing and then secretly\nlanding and hiding a 777, what sense would it make for a terrorist group steal\na commercial jetliner full of passengers from one of the most prestigious\nairlines in the world, guaranteeing that everybody on the planet will be\nlooking for you? Any of a thousand cargo planes or business jets would do the\njob just as well, with only a tiny fraction of the attention.\nFirst of all let me say that I in no way believe remote control is involved in\nthis incident whatsoever, but I would be interested in knowing a little bit\nabout this:\n\u201cAccording to Flight Global, Boeing has applied for a U.S. patent that could\nreturn an aircraft to a predetermined airport in the event that terrorists\ngained control of a flightdeck:\nhttp://www.flightglobal.com/Articles\u2026auto-land+system+for+hijacked.html\u201d\nThere is a patent filed in the US for a system such as this. Just a theory for\nnow and the patent is \u201cjust in case\u201d or is this a real thing.\nJust asking\nDepends on the kind of patent. But many individuals or companies submit\npatents for mere \u201cideas\u201d so they are protected by law so others don\u2019t steal\ntheir \u201cideas\u201d. There are patents for cold fusion reactors, space elevators and\nany kind of sci-fi like technology, do you see them in real life?\nFrom \u201cidea\u201d to reality there are many steps.\nWe already know that this technology exists as it was used in the 9/11\nattacks. If you think that a few terrorists who had problems landing a single\nengine Cessna could maneuver and fly 747s into buildings, then you have lost\nall touch with reality.\nAfter 34 months, I think we can confidently put the \u201cterrorists took it to use\nin an attack\u201d theory to bed. That is, unless they are VERY patient terrorists!\n\ud83d\ude09\nResponding to Bob Snodgrass post #495:\nThe toughest part of your conspiracy theory may be to get the 777 up in the\nair. So if you are right on a terrorist goal, then the best opportunity would\nhave been to commandeer the jet and crash into Petronas Towers or China\u2019s\nImperial Palace/Forbidden City\u2026whatever, wherever. If you are stuck on some\nnuclear device, why not bribe the loading crew? Or substitute your personnel\nto act the imposter and load the device onto the jet?\nWhat we can be sure of is that those Rolls Royce engines are flagged. The\nsecond they ping/respond to a ping, its ON all over again. Secondly, you\nspeculate that the jet would masquerade as any regular international flight in\norder to deliver a nuclear payload. For that to happen in plain sight under\neveryone\u2019s noses, the jet would need to be operating with a transponder.\nWhat do you think would realistically happen when the MH370 transponder code\nshows up on someone\u2019s ATC radar? \u2013 wait, on second thought, please don\u2019t\nanswer\nWhat I can\u2019t quite understand is If this debris that\u2019s being found is from\nFlight 370 then how is it that a plane that crashed to the ocean would produce\nso much debris from I imagine pretty much gliding downward after running out\nof fuel. If the plane exploded in the air then I could imagine a wide and\nvaried debris field, but I just don\u2019t picture the plane breaking up into so\nmany small to mid-sized pieces in a scenario of running out of fuel and coming\ndown to the ocean surface in one piece.\nIF the data is true that the plan appears to have made an adjustment to avoid\nIndonesian radar, given what happened on 911 and given that terrorists like US\ntargets is it really so farfetched to think that this plane was comandeered to\nhit Diego Garcia.\nFurther, given what happened on 911, is it so farfetched to believe that the\nUS Military, faced with a civilian plane heading straight for them that was\nnot communicating, would it not be safe to assume that they would have taken\nsome sort of action.\nFurther, given that the US was officially saying quite early after MH370 went\nmissing, with NO supporting evidence, that the plane was at the bottom of the\nIndian Ocean.\nIt would not have been the first time a country (Korean Flight 007 for\nexample) would not have come forward and told the international community that\nthey had shot down the plane for security reasons, particularly in an area of\nthe world where there is little oversight and not much chance of any\neyewitnesses to the event itself.\nThis is no more farfetched than the idea of a plane that was on fire with all\ncrew and passengers onboard incapacitated flying itself to the Indian Ocean,\nincluding numerous route changes and certainly just as farfetched as believing\non September 10, 2001 that two civilian jetliners were going to deliverately\nfly into the World Trade Centre buildings the next day. I would also ask you\nthis, if another plan was hijacked and started toward a prized target on US\nsoil, what steps exactly might be taken to stop them today. Surely there is a\nplan in place with the military for such a situation that probably involves\njust such a solution.\nLets say someone shot down the plane. Why would they do that when/if the plane\nwere in the middle of the ocean? There is no risk out there and no building\nthey can crash the plane into.  \nIf they thought there was a risk they would still have some time to monitor\nthe plane and see where it was heading before shooting it down.\nIf it was shot down out there I would lean more towards an accident that no\none wants to admit.\nThere are buildings on Diego Garcia. It is a US Military Base, allegedly the\n\u201cnew\u201d, less accessible Guantanamo Bay. That would make it a little more than\nattractive to terrorist groups as a big, juicy US Target.\nIn fact, if you take out any of the turns AFTER it diverts its course to\nBeijing the plane is flying directly AT Diego Garcia unless it takes the\nreported left hand turn to run down toward Australia. If it is a malfunction\nand it was just flying along under autopilot toward Diego Garcia the US\nmilitary radar could not possibly have missed it. Maybe they just watched it\ncrash into the sea once they determined it was more or less unmanned at that\npoint and told the world at that point that they were \u201csure it was at the\nbottom of the Indian Ocean\u201d well before any other agency was giving any\ncredence to that location.\nOoops, I forgot to mention that 440 lbs of Motorola lithium batteries were on\nMH370.\nhttp://www.fz.com/content/mh370-motorolas-cargo-onboard-ill-fated-flight-\nsources-say\nhttp://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/mh370-transporting-200kg-of-lithium-\nbatteries-chief-397333/\nHi Patrick. So I re-read Chapter 6, specifically the part on lithium\nbatteries. An extremely interesting 747 crash that you didn\u2019t mention occurred\nin July of 2011. An Asiana cargo aircraft crashed into the ocean just west of\nJeju on a Seoul \u2013 Shanghai route about 50 minutes into the flight. Contact\nwith Seoul ATC was made by relay through a Korea Air plane that was near the\nstricken 747. The plane also exhibited an unstable vertical profile, at one\npoint descending 10,000 ft in 90 seconds.\n\u201cThe main-deck pallets included two which were listed as containing dangerous\ngoods, loaded into the positions designated ML and PR, adjacent to the rear\nfreight door. Among these hazardous shipments were lithium-ion batteries \u2013 for\nuse in hybrid electric vehicles \u2013 as well as highly-flammable and corrosive\nliquids, for integrated-circuit manufacture, plus lacquers and paints.\u201d\nhttp://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/fire-brought-down-asiana-747f-in-\njust-18min-376916/\n(Wasn\u2019t the Dubai UPS 747 fire nearer the nose?)\nI know we\u2019re not supposed to speculate, but given what you said in Chapter 6\nand given the dangers of lithium batteries and given that the NTSB says oxygen\nmasks and goggles are pilot unfriendly, doesn\u2019t the lithium battery theory fit\nwell with the known circumstances of MH370?\nI am curious to know how a plane can break into so many pieces when it was\nclearly identified in Maldives as flying VERY low \u2026 does anyone know, in a\nscientific manner, what speed is required for a plane to crash into the\nsurface of the ocean to cause extreme breakage? My instinct tells me if the\nreports in the Maldives are true it is more likely that htis plane should have\nsunk not broken and therefore the pieces found support conspiracy work behind\nthe scens and not natural causes.\nIt depends on the angle of impact and a lot of other factors.  \nBut it wont hit the ocean and sink in a totally intact condition. There will\nalways be some wreckage.\nIf the Maldives sightings were true, whatever is floating in the current\nsearch location would not be related to 370 as I don\u2019t think the plane had the\nrange to go all that way west then back all that way southeast, especially at\nlow altitude.\nSuch horsecr&p! WHERE THE HELL IS THE DEBRIS FROM THE \u201cCRASH?\u201d The LARGEST\nCONSPIRACY OF ALL IS THAT THE PLAN WAS INVOLVED IN A CRASH!? WTF?! WHERE ARE\nTHE PIECES?\nWell, by the same token, if it wasn\u2019t a crash, WHERE IS THE PLANE?\nHow do you surreptitiously land a Boeing 777 full of passengers? There isn\u2019t\nan airport in the world where this could be done with any real degree of\nsecrecy.\nAnd even if this were possible, WHY? None of the proposed reasons for such a\nbizarre and extraordinarily difficult scheme make sense in the first place.\nThe plane is in the ocean. Why no pieces yet? Because the ocean is gigantic,\nand because they\u2019re not sure which route the plane took, and because the\ndynamics of crashes, and the type and amount of resultant wreckage, can vary.\nWreckage or not, the theory that the plane is in the ocean is by far the most\nplausible one. Why are so many people hellbent on the conspiracy angle?\n[\u2026] systems to avoid detection. (Patrick Smith, of the popular Ask The Pilot\nwebsite, pointed out in a recent blog post that \u201cvery few of a plane\u2019s\ncomponents are hot-wired to be, as you might say, \u2018always [\u2026]\nWhat is this? Anything related to an Aircraft?\nhttp://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54175\nNot related to a B777 at least.  \nLooks more like an air valve or something like that.  \nBut if you`re thinking about FL370 you can skip that theory.  \nDoes it even float?\nThanks Erik. But couple of hours ago, this came up. Please have a look.\nhttp://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54178\nNever say never. Although there are already many \u201chard to believe\u201d theories\nout there, I find this one hard to believe too.  \nSimply because this is the only part they have found around there that might\ncome from an aircraft. What about other items following same current if that\nthing ended up there? Or maybe they havent been searching for anything else\nyet.\nBut again, never say never. Nothing will surprise me at this point.\nFinding the flight recorders will be extemely difficult since we still don\u2019t\nknow the exact position of the crash. Floating parts are moving and this is\nnot going to be easy. We might have to accept not to have any explanation.\nDear Mr. Patrick Smith\nCan you give your opinion on remarks from Malaysian Prime Minister.\nAs has been mentioned frequently, the 500 lbs. of lithium batteries in the\ncargo are suspect. There have been too many previous incidents where this type\nof battery ignited on planes\u2013and that raises an important question, which is:\nare there specific conditions unique to aviation, that make Li-ion batteries\nmore dangerous on planes than ground testing has yet revealed?\nHere are two possibilities unique to air transit:\n1\\. Rapid, dramatic pressure drop as the plane ascends, causing one or more of\nthe batteries (which themselves are highly pressurized internally) to burst,\nshort other batteries, and ignite. All it would take would be one slightly\nweak battery casing or seal\u2013one that wouldn\u2019t ever be a problem on the ground,\nbut which fails under the rapid onset of a big pressure differential.\n2\\. Electric current induction in the battery cargo as a result of flying\nthrough close-range, HIGH POWER GROUND RADAR on takeoff! Don\u2019t know if radar\ncan penetrate the metal skin of a plane\u2013but if it can, the high power/high\nfrequency RF pulses probably could induce sudden, out-of-range current and/or\nthermal micro-conditions, resonances, or transients inside some or all of the\nbatteries, that might cause failures, shorts, and disaster. Consumer batteries\nin the cargo are NOT designed to be \u201cflight-certified\u201d equipment. This radar-\nrelated risk needs to be seriously investigated and tested!\nBoth of these possibilities need to be rigorously tested in ground labs\u2013they\nare both conditions unique to aviation, and outside the range of standard\ntesting that these batteries are certified through.\nIf the plane really crashed into the South Indian Ocean after many hours of\nflight coupled with Air France accident a few years ago it shows the\nweaknesses in the blackbox/cvr systems. First, in both cases the 30 days\nlimited life of the beacon which hinders the search when it\u2019s most needed as\nin this cases. And now since MH370 flew for many hours after what would have\ntriggered this incident in the first place, any audio from the CVR from that\ntime would already be lost since it only holds the last 2 hours. This kind of\nweaknesses shouldn\u2019t be there now that we have digital media and systems.\nThere\u2019s proposals for ejectable blackboxes as well as video in the cockpit.\nBut they should also look at increasing the maximum recording time.\nI\u2019m looking forward to hearing ATP\u2019s (and the industry\u2019s) recommendations for\nreform on ensuring constant access to flight data, having a competent\ninternational investigatory organization, and increased protections for\npassengers.\nOn that last item, here is a nice story on the inability of pax and cabin crew\nto communicate with the outside world, in the eventuality that the pilots are\nincapacitated or unwilling. Can we go ahead and say that at least one reform\nshould be a separate com system for the cabin, completely independent of the\ncockpit?\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/world/missing-malaysia-airlines-mh370-crew-could-not-\nhave-raised-the-alarm-20140326-zqn41.html\nWay back on Day One went they couldn\u2019t find any wreckage or ping in extremely\nshallow water at the site of the transponder \u201cfail\u201d, I thought this might be a\nSwiss-Air type fire, or a de-compression event.\nBut that position quickly became untenable, for a variety of reasons, not\nleast that a plane supposedly ravaged by fire would still have to be capable\nof traveling as far away as the edges of the Southern Ocean.\nThese two posts (the linked post, and the one by Albert Driver that it cites\nin the text) combined are excellent reasoning that serves as an iron-clad case\nthat 370 is not a fire-related accident.\nhttp://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-\nlost-409.html\nA golfer, named Payne Stewart had a private jet, that lost oxygen to the\nplane. All onboard died quickly. The jet frosted from cold altitudes,\ncontinued flying until it ran out of fuel. It changed directions in flight,\nand was shadowed by military jets. They were able to see in the cockpit and\naccount what happened. It eventually ran out of fuel and crashed in a remote\narea. Flight 370 seems eerily familiar to this incident.\nDid they lose communication with the aircraft itself?\nWere there several hard turns after the cockpit went radio silent?\nDid the aircraft change altitude several times after the cockpit went radio\nsilent?\nThank you, Patrick, for being a much needed voice of reason amid the hysteria\nand conspiracy theories.

The beacon then could be air-dropped into the search area for a\nship to retrieve and activate\u2026but the tow line would have to be shipped out\n(unless a vessel in the area already had the necessary length and strength).\nBut at 1500 miles away from Perth, it would take 36 hours at top speed for a\nvessel with the tow line to make the search area\u2026wasting valuable time.\nSecond question: how do they keep other shipping in the search area away from\na tow line that might stretch several miles (even if mostly underwater) to\navoid clipping the line, or noise interference. And is that why the line is so\nlong: to filter out the noise of the tower, as well as other shipping traffic?\nOkay, so my co- pilot suicide theory is dashed \u2014 or is it?\nAdmittedly, none of it much matters now.

I\u2019m not trying to be cold-blooded, let\u2019s just use vocabulary\ncorrectly and call things as they really are.\nWell said. Thank you. Repeat as needed.\nThe best guess with the facts to hand is that the plane suffers a mishap\n(electrical fire maybe caused by the lithium batteries)coincidentally at the\ntime of changeover from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace. This coincidence\ncauses a major red herring. This is anyway when the pilot notices the\nproblem/emergency (smoke from cargo hold\u2026maybe accompanied by minor\nexplosion/s) and that it has caused the communications systems on board to\nfail (burnt out). Pilot immediately turns aircraft to seek the nearest airport\n(Langkawi? is there another?)haven. To starve the fire of oxygen expert pilot\nrises to 45,000 for as long as passengers not compromised with oxygen\nshortage. Then plot re-descends to 12,000ft, an altitude passenger can breathe\nwithout oxygen masks and to prepare for descent. Flight path directs to\nclosest airport but plane controls get damaged and pilot, crew and passenger\nare unable make descent, overfly Malaysian peninsula and continue helplessly\nbound in southwards flight path till running out of fuel\u2026 so no plot,no\nhijacking, no conspiracy, nothing sinister just an able pilot and crew, doing\ntheir level best but overcome by insurmountable technical issues \u2026\n[\u2026] was a hijacking. There are various theories [\u2026]\nI don\u2019t see how the fire theory can work \u2013 all the airplane fires I\u2019ve heard\nof have pretty much destroyed the plane. I\u2019ve never heard of one that allowed\nthe plane to keep going until it ran out of fuel many hours later. Surely for\nthe fire theory to work, we have to posit that there was a fire severe enough\nto knock out a perfect storm of communications/navigation systems \u2013 or just\nthe people on board \u2013 but that was completely extinguished before it could do\nany more. Is that even possible?\nMy money is on pilot suicide, with a remote location chosen either for life\ninsurance or shame-related reasons: whichever one it was didn\u2019t want anyone\never to be able to figure out what he\u2019d done. It\u2019s difficult to believe we\u2019ll\never know.\nOf course! Simply common sense logic. There was no fire, no explosion. Those\nideas are complete bull-pucky!\nMy theory is somebody had something really valuable (like a fusion reactor\nprototype schematics or whatever) onboard, which he was supposed to deliver to\nBeijing, but some powerful guys (Illuminati or whatever) decided to snatch it\nfor themselves in such a way that it would be impossible to trace the thing.\nTo that end they put a superagent on this plane and/or bribed pilot(s) and/or\nthe carrier of the object.\nSo my question is:\nIs it possible to program the autopilot in such a way that after 1 to 4\npersons jump off the plane with parachute, it by itself regains altitude and\ncruise speed and travels further until it runs out of fuel?\nIs it possible to program the autopilot in such a way that\u2026(plane)\u2026by itself\nregains altitude and cruise speed and travels further until it runs out of\nfuel?\nI\u2019m not going to address the conspiracy theory. As for auto-pilot, I would not\nbe surprised in the least if a pilot would be able to enter in a hundred\ndifferent waypoints if he wanted to. He could also program desired altitude at\neach waypoint as well. Auto-pilot is much more robust (especially on a 777)\nthan simply pointing 208 degrees SSW at 32,000 feet.\nIf you have complex software running on crippled hardware (e.g., as a\nconsequence of fire damage, over temperature as a result of a fire, power\nspike or some cascading combination of all these) then practically no system\nbehavior can be ruled out.\nThe latest information on the flight path is that they dropped to 12k feet\nwhen they turned around. The latest information on the cargo is that it\ncontained lithium batteries and radios, the latter possibly with batteries\ninstalled. The latest information on the air search is that objects consistent\nwith a debris field have been spotted. All of this is consistent with a\nhypothesis of fire, initiation of turn to emergency airfield, crew and\npassengers being overcome, and a crippled flight control system keeping the\naircraft in the air until it ran out of fuel and crashed.\nIf you scour the oceans for floating debris you are bound to find SOMETHING.\nExcuse me for stating the bleeding obvious but if you think that floating\nobject might be the wing or the fuselage of the airliner you are deluded.\nAirliners are not made of balsa wood and tissue paper.\nThey are made of Aluminium and other materials that DO NOT FLOAT.\nThe wreckage of previous airline disasters has always been found on the ocean\nfloor.\nThe plane was headed for ANTARCTICA?\nM\u2019kay\u2026\u2026.right\u2026..whatever.\nMuch of an aircraft is hollow and can indeed float. The fuel is stored in the\nfuselage and the wings. When empty, they will float. The flaperon and flap are\nhollow. They are essentially big empty sealed aluminum cans. They will float\nas well as an aluminum boat or canoe.\nThere is one assumption that most everybody is treating as if it were a fact:\nthat the vehicle heading west over Malaysia is MH370. All I have seen is that\nboth the Malays and Thais had tracked some unidentified vessel \u2013 the Malays\nassume it is likely to be MH370 because it fits the same general time and\nplace where MH370 went missing.\nThe FACT is that both countries tracked a \u201cmystery\u201d plane that flew over Kota\nBharu, Malay Peninsula, VAMPI, GIVAL, and IGREX waypoints.\nThe ASSUMPTION is that this mystery plane is MH370.\nMy question is this: does the timing/distance equation pertaining to the next\nInmarsat ping coincide with the known location of this mystery plane enough to\nverify/confirm that it could be MH370?\nIts important to pin down facts, even convert assumptions into facts. If the\nanswer to this question is \u201cno\u201d, then this one little detail could make a BIG\ndifference\u2026\nI am not knowledgeable about planes at all.. Please pardon my question if\nsilly! I keep on hearing about ELTs going off if plane hits the water. If it\ndid I fact go into the water since they are searching in Indian Ocean..well,\nwhy haven\u2019t they gone off?? Can anyone comment on that. Can they be disabled?\nCan plane be in the water but ELTs don\u2019t go off? How do they work? Does it\ntransmit like black box transmits? Thanks.\nThat\u2019s a good question Vicky. I don\u2019t think the ELTs can be disabled without\nphysically ripping them out and smashing them with a hammer. My best guess is\nit went off when the plane smashed into the water, but it was so far out. Like\nthe age old question \u201cIf a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear\nit, does it make a sound?\u201d\nBackpacker, I agree with you and I have had that question from the beginning\nas well. I also believe that there was approximately a six minute gap between\nthe last air-traffic control communication with flight 370 and the first radar\ntracking of that Westerly headed aircraft. It would appear to me that the\npotential exist that the aircraft being traced at that point is not\ndefinitively flight 370. Another item that I have not seen discussed is the\nfact that normal procedure would have flight 370 in periodic verbal\ncommunication with Malaysia airline dispatch center. I have not heard anyone\nask for the transcript of any communication between the flight and their\ndispatch center. I would think it would be an important clue to know what was\nsaid from the cockpit to the dispatch center and vice versa.\nAgree with backpacker that it is not a proven fact that mystery plane was\nactually MH370.  \nIt is important to distinguish fact from assumption.  \nThere are so many holes in this investigation that I am glad the FBI is\nformally involved now.  \nStill cant help feeling Malaysia Airlines and gov officials are hiding things:\n1\\. Why didnt Malaysia military alert SAR, during the first precious couple\ndays, about the possible mystery plane radar sighting on other side of\npeninsula?  \n2\\. Why did they even try to photoshop the images of the Iranians?  \n3\\. What about reports of the other people who were using fraudulent\npassports?  \n4\\. What about reports of the people that checked-in but didnt board, but were\nreassured their check-in bags were taken off?  \n5\\. What about the report of finding an airplane life raft off Malaysia west\ncoast, but then saying that it sunk before they were able to get it out of the\nwater, and never reported an attempt to go down and get it?  \n6\\. What about the report of the captain being a last minute swap, while the\noriginal pilot Anas Mazlin\u2019s wife left a facebook comment that she was so\nthankful was that her husband wasnt on board?  \n7\\. What about the report of the Malaysia ambassador in China saying that the\nplane had landed safely in Naning?  \n8\\. What about the report of passenger\u2019s families being told by Malaysia\nairlines at the Beijing airport that the plane never took off?  \n9\\. What about the report of Malaysia officials refusing to question the wife\nof the captain for \u201ccultural\u201d reasons, while the life of the passengers are at\nstake (and finally FBI finally twisting their arm to do so two weeks after\nplane went missing)?  \n10\\. What about reports of debris being spotted in the South China Sea during\nthe first two days of SAR, spotted right before dusk (such as an object that\nlooked like an airplane door) and said they couldnt go and get it because it\nwas dark, and both times (day after day) they couldnt find it the next\nmorning?  \n11\\. What about the report of cell phones ringing and the mobile QQ app\nshowing as online?  \n12\\. What about the report that they knew about the South Ocean debris since\nlast Sunday and alerted a Norwegian ship to go check it out, which took four\ndays to get there, but could have easily sent planes over there in a four hour\nflight?  \n13\\. What about the report of them taking a few days to get their hands on the\nflight simulator?  \n14\\. What about that strange reference to Balotelli and then the quick denial\nby another official?\nDid anyone else make note of any other suspicious information?  \nPlease share for the record?  \nBecause there is going to more smoke and mirrors, it\u2019ll be too hard to keep\ntrack.\nMalaysia can only retract so much information and blame incompetence.  \nIf there is so much incompetence and misinformation, you cant blame people for\nthinking there is some cover-up going on.\nDid MH 370 have on board wifi capability?\nDunno the dimensions, but that latest Chinese picture sure has a shape similar\nto an escape slide.\nFound this blog contributor to be very compelling:\nhttp://www.freerepublic.com/tag/by:robert14/index?tab=comments;brevity=full;options=no-\nchange\nThe transcript is a fake.\nWhich was immediately apparent, because none of the terminology is even\nremotely correct.\nThese links might be of interest for some of you to read:\nLithium cargo clue to MH370 fate?  \nhttp://www.airtrafficmanagement.net/2014/03/lithium-cargo-clue-to-fate-of-\nmh370/\nMissing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370: Flammable Cargo May Have Caused Mid-\nAir Disaster  \nhttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/missing-malaysian-airlines-flight-mh370-flammable-\ncargo-may-have-caused-mid-air-disaster-1441356\nSomething that always gets me when this kind of thing happens, is why don\u2019t\naircraft have some kind of beacon or transponder that ejects from a sea-\ncrashed plane?\nI mean, fishing boats to oil tankers have devices that activate if they\ncapsize or sink, yet a 140 tonne airplane can cross the same stretches of\nwater without any of this maritime distress equipment?\nCome to think on it, why aren\u2019t black boxes designed to float? Why do we\nalways have this farce of the \u2018race against time\u2019 to locate the boxes before\nthe batteries die?\nI\u2019m a complete schmuck, and even I can see a need for some way of locating a\nlost plane at sea with means other than luck. To me, in some ways, aviation\nseems so backward\u2026\nWhile not exactly what you\u2019re asking for, life rafts send radio signals when\ndeployed.\nEverything could malfunction some time or another. I suspect that a post-crash\nejection beacon would require some type of explosive or pressurized device.\nYou want to add something like that to the worldwide fleet? It might make\nlocating easier, but would surely mean that there are more downed airliners to\nlocate.\nEven if they made a bouyant black box, bouyancy probably would be of little\nvalue since box should be securely bolted or welded to a 300,000 pound\nmachine.\nOh, geez. I think I may have found different pieces of this mysterious puzzle\nthat fit together.\nAfter examining the newly released transcript, I found the timing of events to\nbe a curious thing, and then found there seems to be some inconsistencies\nbetween it and supposed facts from news reports. I will save speculation on\nmotive until the end, and first will go through the points in time that can\nhelp explain what could have happened.\n1\\. ACARS & \u201cpings\u201d.\nThis is the best place to start because this revelation was independent from\nMAS investigators, and although MAS initially denied it, they had to accept\nthis info, the hard evidence is irrefutable.\nLet\u2019s walk through it. MH370 take off at 00:41 should have been the first\nACARS data transmission, although not mentioned in reports it is supposed to\nhave taken place because of the way ACARS reports pre-specified flight events:\ntake-off, reaching cruising altitude, landing gear. Well, the first reported\nACARS transmission is at 1:07. We are told that it was turned off because it\nshould have transmitted again at 1:37, since it suppose to do that at half\nhour intervals. We are also told that the deliberately-disabled ACARS\ncontinued to send out \u201cpings\u201d with the first of 7 automated hourly handshake\n\u201cpings\u201d at 2:11, and continuing on to the last \u201cping\u201d at 8:11, even though we\nare not given the data of the intermediary \u201cpings\u201d.\nSo I found these times suspicious. Whether we are talking about half hour or\nhourly intervals in transmissions or \u201cpings\u201d, it should be consistent, but\nit\u2019s not. For example, 1:07 and 2:11 arent consistent with the half hour or\nhour intervals. If it was 1:07, then 1:37, then 2:07, then 2:37, etc. On the\nother hand, if we\u2019re talking about 2:11 data transmission, and go backwards by\nhalf an hour, there should have been one at 1:41, then 1:11, and the first one\nat 0:41, which happens to be the exact time of take-off. So I found that very\nsuspicious, how these times correspond to each other, at first making me\ncontemplate if maybe MH370 identification was replaced with another plane, but\nthat cant be true, since ACARS are not dependent on transponder id, but rather\nthe actual device which is hardwired into the Rolls Royce engine, making it\nimpossible to be swapped mid-air.\nThen, I noticed that the 1:07 signal actually corresponded with one of the two\nredundant pilot reports to ATC that the flight had reached the cruising\naltitude of 35,000, which would have been one of the pre-specified ACARS\nflight events, and therefore 1:07 was a moment for a signal to be transmitted,\nas opposed to being based on the half hour or hourly interval trigger.\nBecause of this confusion in timing, I did more research on ACARS and learned\nthat actually there are two data transmission devices on the 777 both of which\nsend to Iridium satellite system, but have different purposes. One of them is\nthis ACARS, another is AHM or Airplane Health Management System. ACARS is the\none that reports engine data according to pre-specified flight events and not\nby time intervals, and since there was no subsequent ACARS signal after 1:07,\nit would mean that the plane never actually completed the next event, which\nwould have been deployment of landing gear, which suggests that it landed\nwithout its gears down, most likely over water. On the other hand, AHM is the\nsystem which reports according to time intervals and is subscriber based,\nwhich has been referred to before in reports about MAL not subscribing that\nand thus not being able to locate the aircraft. The aforementioned \u201cpings\u201d\nwere coming from the AHM and not the ACARS system. Therefore, the conclusion\nthat the ACARS was deliberately disabled is not necessarily true, and the\nhandshakes were actually empty \u201cpings\u201d from the unsubscribed AHM system.\nNow this does not explain what happened, but it helps put things in\nperspective. Regardless of whether we are talking about ACARS and AHM, one\nthing for sure is that the transponder was turned off and that was done\nmanually and thus intentionally, given the aircraft stayed in control and\ndeliberately veered in different directions through waypoints without ever\nsending a distress signal (assuming this wasnt a cyber hijack).\n2\\. Transponder.\nIf we look at when the transponder was switched off, we can understand reports\nthat it not only coincided with the plane reaching its first waypoint Igari\n(as was instructed by Malaysia ATC) but it also coincided with the plane\nentering the \u201cgrey area\u201d airspace between Malaysia and Vietnam. But I would\nfurther add that, by looking at the time in the transcript, we can see that\nthe transponder was turned off at about the 40th minute of the flight. And\nfrom an article I read about flight protocol (in a Guardian online article\nentitled \u201cWhat happened to MH370? A pilot and a flight attendant give their\nviews\u201d) apparently the pursuer himself (the person in charge of the cabin\ncrew) cannot access the cockpit until 40 minutes into the flight. Is that a\ncoincidence too? Makes me think that the pursuer or someone else whom the\npilots trusted was able to enter the cockpit at that time, order them to turn\noff the transponder by means of threat, and later tell them to fly according\nto waypoints that would skirt around radar detection.\nAnother point which drew my suspicion but dont know if it is relevant because\nI could not up with an explanation for, is that the flight protocol article\nmentioned that the flight deck is sterile for the first 20 minutes of flight.\nWell, the 20th minute coincides with the first of two redundant communications\nbetween MH370 and ATC that \u201cMH370 remaining in flight altitude 350\u201d. In\nbetween those two messages, at 1:01 ATC tried to reach MH370 but goes\nunanswered and was radio silent until 1:07 at which point the same message is\nrepeated. Could the co-pilot gotten up for a bathroom break and forgot if he\nhad said it, so he repeated himself? Could the messages have been repeated\nbecause each pilot said it once? Could it have been a signal from the co-pilot\nto ATC that something was amiss? ATC tries to communicate with MH370 at 1:08\nbut while most all previous communications were quick responses within\nseconds, the response to the 1:08 message wasnt replied until a minute and a\nhalf later.\n3\\. Motive.\nSpeculation becomes much heavier at this point, but we can see how different\nmotives fit into the course of events, for example, what happened after the\ntransponder was switched off? From radar reports we know that the plane flew\nup to 45,000 and then plunged down to around 30,000, it didnt plunge into the\nsea, but kept on flying and somewhat unevenly. This sounds like it was being\nflown manually and out of emotion, rather than by the calm and steady hand or\nthe auto-pilot.\nThese unstable maneuvers can lead one to think that the excessively\nexperienced captain was already not in control of the plane, and possibly the\nco-pilot was being ordered to fly. Maybe the captain was eliminated as a way\nto show the co-pilot that they meant business. Without the captain, the young\nco-pilot could have been more malleable.\nOr even possibly the co-pilot was involved, although this theory doesnt sound\nlikely since he was engaged to his flight school sweetheart, he comes from a\nwell-connected family that may have helped him land the job of a 777 pilot,\nand he had his whole life to look forward to. He wouldnt have needed life\ninsurance and if he really did, would have likely waited until after getting\nmarried so his wife could benefit from it. However, depictions of him as a\nplayboy dont help paint a wholesome picture of him and one can easily imagine\nthat he could have gotten mixed up with the wrong people and been compromised.\nIf it were a crew member responsible for the missing plane, they could have\nspiked the water and drinks with poison or sleeping pills in order to\nincapacitate the passengers.\nSuicide by one of the crew members could have been a motive to fly up and\nplunge down, but then they chickened out and instead of direct hit on the sea,\nthey decided to just fly out into the open ocean in order for the suicide to\nnot directly be a mass murder of the passengers. For suicide theory, I found\nthat MAS has been planning to file for bankruptcy and wonder if a crew member\nwas worried about their and their family\u2019s financial future due to that.\nAnother possible situation was that special covert agents were on board and\nwere instructed to deviate the plane from its flight path and plunge it into\nthe farthest reaches of the earth, because of some highly dangerous cargo, for\nexample nuclear or biochemical weapon. As you may remember, a UN-backed\ninternational nuclear agency was called in quickly at the beginning of the SAR\nand reported that they did not find any explosion in their satellite images,\nbut I wonder if they believed the plane carried nuclear items.\nAnd of course, the theory that these covert operative were after some specific\ncargo or person and then jumped out of the plane after it was placed on auto-\npilot, instead of landing it (since the ACARS never reported landing gear\ncoming down) in order to get rid of the evidence.\nThanks for doing some research\u2013that\u2019s helpful. Acknowledgements, additions, &\ncorrections\nSupposing that ACARS is an event-triggered system \u2013 that could explain the\nseemingly random 1:07 time point. Even if you are right that the next\ntriggered event would be landing gear, the engines would still attempt the\nhourly electronic handshake.\nYou rightly wonder why the next ping was at 2:11 instead of an hourly 2:07?\nThere is latency\u2026relating to time delay over distance, but I believe we can\ndisregard that notion since all the others seem to happen \u2018on-time\u2019 even\nthough those are theoretically further & further afield from the Inmarsat\nsatellite. The ping protocol might be something along the lines of a) Ping on\ntakeoff; b) ping on every relevant event; c) ping every half hour until\nsustained Flight Level; d) ping hourly\u2026but waive the routine hourly ping\nwithin 5 minutes of a preceding event ping. So this would give 0:41, 1:07,\n1:11 (waived), 2:11, 3:11, etc. I believe engine pings are a redundancy to\nACARS that weren\u2019t shut off.\nRadar is less reliable relating to heights. That being said, I\u2019ve seen the\nnumbers suggest the airline went to 45,000 then plunged to 23,000 (not the 30k\nyou mentioned).\nYour 40th minute co-relation is a very good catch. I had read that article but\ndidn\u2019t apply it to take-off. So now there are 2 huge coincidences at this time\nthat are hard to over-estimate.\n1) The jet disappeared at the perfect place between leaving Malay air and\nentering Viet space.  \n2) The jet disappeared at the first moment when someone new could access the\ncabin.\nIf either of the pilots were involved in some plot, a crew-member accomplice\ncould have entered. Here\u2019s a question: was the flight-school sweetheart an\nattendant on MH370?\nAnother version is that an attendant could have been coerced to give up the\ncode by a hijacker/special agent/terrorist. I\u2019m not ready to say neither that\nthere was a plotting pilot nor that there wasn\u2019t a plotting pilot. I have my\ntheory on that, but I\u2019m not sure how that speculation helps.\nFor example, here I\u2019m embellishing what someone wrote on http://www.balloon-\njuice.com/2014/03/18/mh370/\nTwo additional ideas with no proof\u2026  \n1) the pilots react to a fire appropriately but inadvertently kill the\npassengers through a cruel convergence of smoke, failing systems and/or their\nattempts to save the plane as they try to starve the fire of oxygen at 45,000\nfeet. The pilots themselves survive and try to make it to Lakwami. When they\ndiscover all passengers dead, they don\u2019t know what to do and bypass that\nlanding window. The plane shifts course several times as they struggle to come\nto terms with the situation. Feeling shame and grief, they set the plane south\nalong the pinged path to clear their thoughts, come to terms, consider\noptions, hide all evidence of their fate. Effectively its suicide after the\nfact, not really pre-meditated.\n2) the pilots die from the smoke but set the autopilot. The passengers survive\nand eventually break into the cockpit. But no one knows where they are or how\nto fly or land a plane. Communications are out. Perhaps someone manages enough\nto alter course, first north and then south, the latter because they are\nlooking for Malaysia. But south is the Indian Ocean and they run out of fuel.  \nI guess anyone can make this stuff up, and until or if we know, it\u2019s about as\ngood as anything.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nHere\u2019s another coincidence that\u2019s hard to over-estimate:\nThe engines stopped pinging at about 8:10 a.m. Is it a coincidence that the\npinging stopped at almost exactly the time that the plane would\u2019ve run out of\nfuel?\nOne of the pilots clocked the other with the crash axe, then committed\nsuicide.\nIt is the simplest theory that encompasses all the known facts. And it\nwouldn\u2019t be the first time.\nRegarding flight hours\u2013don\u2019t many airlines require ex-military pilots for\ninternational flights? Delta does (or at least did).\nNo. Not Delta, not ever.\nI can\u2019t seem to find an answer to this question so I\u2019m hoping someone on here\nmay know. First of all, my heart goes out to these families. Can\u2019t even\nimagine what they\u2019re good through! With that said, if the disappearance of\nthis flight was caused by a person on this flight \u2013 I\u2019d find hard really hard\nto believe that not ONE soul knows anything about it. Not a close friend or\nfamily member? Does anyone know if the families have been thoroughly\nquestioned? Driving me crazy.\nHas anyone checked on and around Kerguelen Island? It\u2019s a remote French colony\nwith very few permanent residents, and no airport \u2013 but a plateau on its\nwestern end that could conceivably act as an isolated landing strip. The\nisland sits within an hour\u2019s flight of the extreme southern tip of the ping\narc, you can see it inside the \u201cpink area\u201d of http://i.imgur.com/zNgnicG.png\u2026\nClearly the hijacker was not on a suicide mission \u2013 why go through all the\ntrouble of changing course, avoiding detection, and flying 7+ hours if you\njust planned to crash into the sea. Kerguelen is the only viable landmass in\nthis direction.\nI would be cautious about the Inmarsat data \u2013 the company has (inexplicably)\nnot actually released the data of the previous six pings \u2013 just commented that\nthe aircraft appeared to be flying straight and at a consistent speed away\nfrom the equator. That makes no sense, unless they\u2019re only referring to the\nlast 3-4 pings. In any case, other scenarios are possible, and could be\nverified if the full data were made public.\nHope this helps\u2026\nJeff Wise on Slate.com writes,\nInmarsat revealed some crucial information. \u201cThe ping timings got longer,\u201d\nInmarsat spokesman Chris McLaughlin stated via email. That is to say, at each\nstage of its journey, the aircraft got progressively farther away from the\ngeostationary satellite\u2019s position, located over a spot on the equator south\nof Pakistan, and never changed its heading in a direction that took it\ncloser\u2014at least for very long.\nThe recent Inmarsat press release might douse the theory that contemplates if\nMH370 could have tailed, or flown \u201cin the (radar) shadow\u201d of flight SQ68 from\nSingapore to Barcelona. It looks as if that flight path draws nearer to the\ngeo-synchronous satellite location before it pulls away\u2026at least that\u2019s what\nSQ68 is doing tonight LIVE on Flight tracker.com.\nI wondered if this same \u201cflying in the shadow\u201d theory might work on another\nflight. I even thought I might be onto something! I caught my breath when I\nsaw the target SIA68 flying to Barcelona intersect the Hong Kong to\nJohannesburg flight SAA287 in the throat of the Malacca Strait. Could this be\nsomething?\nAlas, there wasn\u2019t enough time available to make that 10.5 hour flight. Even\nducking out in Madagascar requires nearly 8 hours. Madagascar is somewhat\ninside the projected arc, but there is some leeway. Another fault to this\nnotion is that the flight path to Madagascar also draws a little nearer to\nInmarsat before going further\u2026which fails for the same reason as the Barcelona\nflight.\nHas anyone seen how turbulent the seas are off of southwestern Australia? Does\nanyone really believe anything like an airplane wing could remain intact and\nfloating for over a week under those conditions?\nJust the question about it continuing to float is one thing but, even if so,\nit almost certainly would\u2019ve drifted thousands of kilometers by now.\nSeriously, part of me is thinking that there should be a part of the search in\nthe area where they think the plane might have gone down into the ocean;\nsearching that area for signals at the bottom from the black boxes, and it\ncould actually incredibly be a less widespread area than that searching for\nobjects floating on the ocean if indeed they\u2019re still floating on the ocean. I\nthink there\u2019s less point in spending days and days searching for something\nthey may never find, rather than searching for the main body of the airplane\nwhich if there will remain basically wherever it is waiting to be found.\nWhy will no one listen to me? (Cue tiny chin violin with paper clip for bow)\nListen: Given a mystery, people are bound to speculate. The longer the mystery\ngoes unexplained, the more ludicrous the speculation. Read my lips: NOTHING\nEVEN REMOTELY SINISTER happened. Well, depends on your definition of sinister.\nI call it more like \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\nYES it was thoroughly planned. BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS ANYONE THINKS.\nThe First Officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, was ONLY 27 YEARS OLD, for crying out\nloud.\nWhy don\u2019t you ask Patrick what the pressure on a 27-year-old man who lives in\na repressive, idealogically backward country, with 24/7 indoctrination in the\nKoran, who just happens to be one of the lucky ones to get an incredible,\nunimaginably fantastically prestigous job in ANY country, let alone Malaysia,\nwho has HAD THE CHANCE to see what life is like in the West for people of his\nstature, yet probably being hammered down in his airline by the higher-ups who\nCONTINUALLY REMIND HIM WHAT A PUNK HE IS in no uncertain terms \u2014 trust me, I\nhave lived among the Asians for a total of 15 years so I am not speaking from\na racist viewpoint \u2014 but in his airline, he is less than dirt, he is a junior\npiece of shit who gets lectured every single day WHY he is a lucky, privileged\npiece of shit, with hints that maybe DADDY got him to this position \u2014 come on,\nyou can all see where I\u2019m going.\nIn Asian culture, it doesn\u2019t matter how many bars you have on your shoulder \u2014\nif you are 27 years old you are a PUNK who really SHOULD be living in Mummy\u2019s\nbasement and working at the bank, not flying around on Boeing aircraft\nsurrounded by TRUE HEROES who have put in 11,000 hours to your 2,800 . . .\nWell, the pressure is going to be mind-bendingly enormous. Why has no one\nclued into this factor?\nHIS was the LAST VOICE on the microphone. Abdul Hamid did it \u2014 it\u2019s so very\nclear to me that it seems like for everyone else who are seeing aliens and\nexplosives-laden 777s hitting Israel \u2014 FOR CHRIST\u2019S SAKE, this was a 27-year\nold man who wanted to commit suicide, who knew EXACTLY how to pull it off, who\nno doubt spent weeks if not months planning it \u2014 EVERY TIME IN A 777 was a dry\nrun for him \u2014 and then just implemented his plan.\nIt worked PERFECTLY. I will not go into the details of how he did it \u2014 that\u2019s\nfor others to figure out \u2014 but JUST ADMIT THAT HE, ONE PERSON, had the\nknowledge, the ability and if you accept my theory, THE MOTIVE to pull this\noff.\nHe MAY well have killed all the people behind him in the cabin in implementing\nhis plan, but no doubt he did so with a heavy heart. To him, he was just\nputting them to sleep. And then, he was going to put himself to sleep and do\nhis damndest that the plane would NEVER BE FOUND so it would always be a\nmystery and his family would not have to bear the shame.\nI challenge you: please tell me just HOW you believe he could not have pulled\nall this off all by himself?\nI rest my case. It is THAT SIMPLE, and if you look at it logically, that is\nthe MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION for why this plane went down.\nWholy crap! And I mean with the \u201cW\u201d. What a jaded perspective you have of\nAsian culture in general but also of Malaysian and Malay culture. I suppose,\nanything to help justify your ideas that if someone is a member of such a\nculture then we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that they might commit some horrific\nact, either as they see mandated by their culture or as a personal cry out\nfrom beneath the pressures of their culture. It\u2019s not as if Western culture,\nand especially US culture hasn\u2019t created its own all-to-frequent insanity\nvictims.\nThere may be some foul-play here, motivated by a psychological disturbance or\notherwise, but it\u2019s highly unlikely motivated by some repressive culture or\nsociety as you\u2019re making it out to be. Malaysia is a Muslim country, but it\u2019s\na democratic Muslim country with religious freedoms and a whole variety of\nreligions exist there. It\u2019s not the repressive society that you\u2019re making it\nout to be. Get a grip on your negatively slanted views.\nto Nicholas Robinson: Sir, you need to be more careful with the things you\nsay!\nWhat if the pilots did everything they could to save the passengers from a\ncatastrophic accident like a massive fire? And they decided to commit suicide\nafter saving the aircraft but not the people in it?\nYou see\u2026? I hope you do.\n\u201cI rest my case. It is THAT SIMPLE, and if you look at it logically, that is\nthe MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION for why this plane went down.\u201d\nYou keep coming up with so many fantastic and dramatic scenarios! If this\ntheory is really that simple and logical, the 1 you truly believe, then why do\nyou keep inventing all the other new pet theories of yours?\nWhat is most galling is that you write it as if it is a logical fact. While it\nmay seem logical to you, in reality, it is merely an opinion. I get that you\nare trying to put 2+2 2gether in a way that makes sense to you, but please\nremember, you are just guessing.\nYou earn more credibility when your writing reflects these 2 truths:\n1\\.

All this just proves that Airlines and the\ncompanies associated with the Flight Industry care more about a buck than the\nsafety of their customers.

It is\n> totally impossible for that to happen. At a certain altitude, a plane\u2019s\n> engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings will no longer\n> provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to sustain flight.\nI had thought there was a condition called the Coffin Corner, where the stall\nspeed is equal to the critical Mach number. If you get into that situation and\ndon\u2019t do _exactly_ the right thing, the aircraft starts to fall \u2014 which\nincreases its speed. You then get Mach shockwaves hitting critical parts of\nthe airframe.\n_Could_ this have happened? I don\u2019t know.\nWould the pilots have been stupid enough to get into this? It seems unlikely\nto the point of impossibility.\nThe further south position could perhaps reflect the continued path of the\nplane after it over-flew the way point.\nAfter being turned around and crossing over Malacca Strait, the plane was then\nheading SW, but the Earth\u2019s rotation turned that SW direction ultimately into\na southern direction.\nObjects on the earth don\u2019t work that way. If the earth is spinning at 1000mph\nat the surface approximately, then according to your theory, if I drop a ball,\nthe earth will move under the ball and it will end up at at a point roughly\n1500 feet away if it takes one second to drop. Under such conditions it would\nbe impossible for one to fly in a western direction at less than 1000 mph but\nwe do it every day. This is like the comments about the plane floating into\nspace. It doesn\u2019t work that way either. You need 25,000 mph to escape the\nearth\u2019s gravity.\nI\u2019m going to accept my ignorance and trust your knowledge. But then I must\nask, if those points on the map are indeed satellite pings of the plane as it\nflew essentially southward, then why the continual subtle but constant\ndrifting away from a Southwest to a southern course, and then ultimately to a\nsoutheast course? It started at 95 degrees East, got as far as 82 degrees East\nand ended at 87 degrees East. Can you give me some other explanation for that?\nI\u2019ve lost understanding of where all these posts are but any variation in the\nfight path can be easily explained by saying someone is at the controls of the\ncraft.\nYour comments however got me to thinking about the pings and the question of\naccuracy. Perhaps this has been discussed here and confirmed in the media, but\nwere independent tests performed on other planes during the period before the\nlast ping arc determination. What I\u2019m asking is whether they shut a few planes\ndown and then looked at the pings and were able to determine the arc location\nfor these test planes with some level of accuracy (precision?). That seems to\nme would be something they did as the credibility of the arc and pings went up\nsubstantially from when it was first released by the wsj.\nSo I would agree with Bob: the answer is that there was a person at the\ncontrols.\nHowever, I\u2019ll add that on another forum someone claimed that the drift you\ncite was due to the difference between South vs. True South, and how that\nmight tweak the compass heading as a plane neared Antarctica (if not manually\ncorrected).\nI can\u2019t vouch for that; just passing along what I read.\nI believe my earlier answer still holds: in that part of the world, magnetic\nsouth is considerably east of South Pole. Both points seem to be in the same\ngeneral direction when you are at the equator. But as you get nearer and\nnearer to the South Pole, the divergence (declination) becomes more and more\napparent. If the jet\u2019s navigation was tuned to magnetic south, then the flight\nplan would seem to adjust/drift to the east as it increased its latitude and\nneared the Antarctic.\nHere\u2019s a way to look at it for anyone living on any continent in the world.\nFrom where you are, stand up and do your best to point in the direction of the\nBig Island Hawai\u2019i (no, not on a map, but in real life). Now point in the\ndirection of Honolulu on the island of O\u2019ahu. Both times you\u2019re pointing in\nthe same general direction. Now if you were a lot closer, like 100 miles away,\nyou would be pointing in 2 distinct directions. The extreme would be if you\nwere on the island of Maui where you could stretch both arms out to each side\nand point NW to O\u2019ahu and SE to Hawai\u2019i.\nI was commenting on post 451 \u2013 could the southern arc location be a mistaken\ncoordinates meant for Beijing.\nHowever, I (still) favor mistake coordinates sending the plan to the northern\narc (a reversal of lat and long) \u2013 my post 437.\nThe southern arc makes sense for hiding the crashed plane. The northern arc\nmakes more sense for major accident resulting in a long ghost flight.\nI think we\u2019ve A)got a good sense of where this thing is at now, while B)\nhaving floated every imaginable theory as to how and why.\nWith the struggles of Immarsat in mind, as well as the general ineptitude of\nMalaysia and some of its neighbors, what I would enjoy is a new thread that\ntackles potential solutions regarding A) the continuous capture of flight data\nin real time, B)an international investigative organization, and C)greater\nprotections for passengers. (I would suggest that a supranational \u201cA\u201d would\nmake \u201cB\u201d possible).\nI think a good starting point for the discussion is today\u2019s WSJ report on\nImmarsat almost single-handedly trying to push the Southern solution for 10\ndays.\nThanks\nIf If If \u2026\n1\\. Okay, the plane had a catastrophic failure (of whatever kind), the pilots\nfollowed their training, tried to fix the problem and get back to an airport\nfor an emergency landing, seems like the most plausible START of a theory to\nme.\nBUT:\n1\\. Why did they overshoot the targeted airport?  \n2\\. If they were overcome, and the plane was already set to the return course,\nthen they kept flying until they ran out of fuel. So why isn\u2019t the search\nfocused on that flight path to its logical end?  \n3\\. How did the plane, with incapacitated pilots, make the altitude changes?\nUnless\u2026  \n4\\. If there were a fire, would the pilots go to the high altitude to put the\nfire out, then return to a low altitude, but by that time the damage was done\nto the electronics (including comms) and control and the plan was disabled?\nThen could it still be able to fly for 7 additional hours? Or would it go\nstraight down on its return to lower altitude?\nAlternative \u201cHijack\u201d theory, a la 9/11; The cockpit is breached by hijackers\nwho knew how to operate the plane, just like the 9/11 hijackers. THEY killed\nthe pilots and took control of the plane, THEY executed the \u201cu-turn\u201d, but then\nthey lost it. Maybe THEY were counter attacked, explaining the up and down and\nerratic flying. BUT that theory doesn\u2019t explain how 230 passengers couldn\u2019t\nget a message out (cell towers notwithstanding\u2013how about Sat phones?) AND it\ndoesn\u2019t explain the 7 hour flight. UNLESS, again, the hijackers are\nincapacitated and AGAIN the flight continues on the programmed vector so AGAIN\nthe search should be focused on that flight path.\nWhere am I wrong?\n1\\. $1,000,000 question. Supposing that they were fighting fire or whatever\nwhile over land, then why make so many course corrections in the Malacca\nStrait without turning around and hitting up Langkawi Island once again? If\nthey had time to input waypoints, why not input Langkawi Island as a way\npoint?\n2\\. Not enough time & fuel. The logical end in that direction would be on the\n40 degree arc around the Immarsat satellite above the Arabian sea midway\nbetween India and Somalia. Their westward movement is vectoring directly\ntowards that geo-synchronous location. That yields the DR Congo or Central\nAfrican Republic on the other side of the arc. In the 5.5 hours they remained\nairborne, they would not have either time or fuel to make it to the 40 degree\npoint on the west side of the satellite.\n3\\. A properly trimmed aerodynamic vessel will self-correct to some degree.\nThose would appear as gentle mid-course corrections and not drastic swings in\nheading nor elevation.\n4\\. Need to get the timeline correct. Either the pilots are capable or\nincapacitated. If capable, would they point to the sky? Oxygen is a major\ncontributor towards sustaining/accelerating a COMBUSTION fire. Perhaps high\naltitude could starve such a fire of its oxygen. Flames may turn to embers but\nI seriously doubt they would completely extinguish a fire. Fires take a long\ntime to go out.\n**Speculation alert, not a proven fact ->** On the other hand, I imagine that\nthe principal contributor to an ELECTRICAL fire is power supply more so than\noxygen. If so, then altitude change and oxygen starvation wouldn\u2019t have such a\nsignificant affect on a fire.\nContinuing with your scenario, supposing pilots unable to manually or\nhydraulically influence speed or direction due to disabled\nelectronics/communications or incapacitated pilots. Plane should continue\nflying its westward heading, buffeted by winds pushed one direction or\nanother. Constant speed would keep it mostly level and if it veered up or\ndown, the trim would level it out once again.\nTwo caveats are:  \n1\\. If an engine flamed out, that would make a significant impact on\nprojections.  \n2\\. If the descent from 45K to 27k was too steep and the airliner gained too\nmuch speed, then its possible that the trim couldn\u2019t catch up fast enough to\nmake a difference prior to splashdown.\nLook at my reply to backpacker, just above your post. I think that explains\nthe different ultimate location of the plane in relation to what appeared to\nbe it\u2019s original more southwest direction as it was crossing over the Malacca\nStrait.\nDamn it, the above post was meant in reply to Howard Lippin, just above your\npost, backpacker.\nThe route was reprogrammed and the plane did a turn. And then we come to the\nseeming out of bounds climb to 45000 feet. This in my mind marks loss of\ncontrol. A previous post (#348) suggests autothrottle going to full thrust due\nto voltage surge. Perhaps someone can explain autothrottle a bit more?  \nIt seems you have to invoke some failure that is not fatal to the plane but is\nfatal to its occupants. Very hostile environment at 45000 feet. If hull seal\nis compromised what happens to the cabin temperatures for example?\nhttp://www.weathergraphics.com/malaysia/contrail.shtml\nThere seems to be a bit of a turn to the east in the last two satellite pings,\nwould that possibly suggest that the right engine may have died first and the\nleft engine then pulled the plane to the left (east) before it too eventually\ndied from the fuel being terminated? It just seems a strange little turn in\nthe last 1/2 hour or so of the flight.\nJust taking the weatherman\u2019s word for it\u2013and who even knows his\ncredibility?\u2013he writes,\n\u201cThis backtrack fully compensates for magnetic declination and wind field\nchanges, producing a curved and slightly uneven path.\u201d\nIn English that would seem to mean that the closer something actually\napproaches the South Pole, the greater the variance you\u2019ll notice between\nmagnetic south and true south. Near Amsterdam Island, the magnetic declination\nis -40. That\u2019s a big number. In that part of the world, magnetic south is\npretty far east of the South Pole and would explain the drift and why the\neast-turning curve in the flight path (please see map)\nhttp://geomag.org/info/declination.html.\nAgain, my evaluation is completely based on how I interpret the\nweathergraphics link you presented\u2013I\u2019m pretending that it is credible. I\u2019m in\nno position to say whether or not their analysis is correct.\nI think what we, or at least I, neglected to consider is the movement of the\nEarth itself. The plane was originally heading in a southwest direction, but\nif there were no adjusting of its course with respect to the Earth\u2019s rotation\nthen that southwest direction would little by little turn into a southern\ndirection and, as we see on that satellite plotted map, ultimately turn into a\nsoutheast direction.\nA look at the map of the earth showing KL, Beijing and the location of spotted\ndebris in the South Ocean (as seen here\nhttp://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/20/article-2584816-1C6FFBBC00000578-608_634x558.jpg\n) makes it look like the position of Beijing and the South Ocean location are\nalmost identically opposites in terms of north and south positioning. Could\nthis have been a coincidence or deliberate/accidental computer programming\nmistake?\nCurious observation\u2026 Not exactly correct though. Opposites from an east-west,\nyes, pretty much. Beijing is about 18 degrees further east from KL, and this\npotential final location of the plane is about 17 degrees west of KL (more or\nless in both cases). However, Beijing is about 37 degrees north of KL, and\nthis ocean location is about 51 degrees south of KL (again, with respect to\nwhere the plane may ultimately have entered the water).\nDon\u2019t theorize that much. The copilot commited suicide and that\u2019s it. Not the\nfirst time, and sadly maybe not the last one\u2026\nIf it would only be a case of suicide, but in that scenario it\u2019s mass murder\nin the process.\nPatrick,\nYour update disputes the \u201cshadow the Singapore flight\u201d theory but you assume\nMH370 would have been directly underneath the Singapore plane. MH370 could\nhave been just above. And how could they land unnoticed? Simple- they were in\nfriendly territory, and Pakistan isn\u2019t very cooperative. Remember they had Bin\nLaden living right next to one of their top military sites?\nSomeone in Boeing thinks it\u2019s there, must have a good reason.\nSeems like the whole point in hijacking a plane to use it as a weapon is that\nyou are already in the target\u2019s airspace. What\u2019s the point in hijacking a\nplane and flying it to Pakistan, to re-route somewhere else when Pakistan has\nit\u2019s own planes?\nAviate, navigate, communicate. Maybe communicate is at the end but it\u2019s part\nof the process of dealing with an emergency. If there was a malfunction of\nsome kind requiring action starting 1:21 am and vhf emergency radio frequency\nstill active at 1:30 why was no communicating call made? Did the hearing of\nmumblings at 1:30 by the other plane trying to make contact mean there was a\nconscious response of some kind ? Or could they be unconscious and their\nmumblings transmitted automatically on that frequency. Could someone clarify?\nI understand it only takes 5 seconds or so to communicate an emergency. There\nare two pilots. Surely one would have 5 seconds to transmit. If it was\nconfirmed that someone reprogrammed the route after 1:21 am then it seems\nsomeone would be capable of making a 5 second emergency call immediately\nafterward. What am I missing here?\n1 \u2013 Their intentions was to communicate once they had the situation (whatever\nthat might be) under control, but for some reason they were never able to do\nso\n2 \u2013 They did not want to communicate, as in delibarately taking the plane\nsomewhere else, or whatever they were up to\n3 \u2013 Someone else took control over the plane and the pilots never had a chance\nto communicate\nhttp://www.weathergraphics.com/malaysia/contrail.shtml\nThose coordinates put it fairly close to Amsterdam Island, but even further\nsouth. My, what a remote place for the plane to finally end its flight.\nAnother 2 hours of so, and it would\u2019ve ended in Antarctica. The ocean currents\nin that part of the world are severe, as it\u2019s the northern edge of what\u2019s\ncalled the \u201csouthern ocean\u201d in which the currents really have nothing to stop\nthem from flowing totally circular all around Antarctica. If there were some\ndebris on the ocean surface from where the plane hit the water, wow, it would\nbe far, far away from there by now, somewhere south of Australia probably, if\nstill floating. And with the ocean currents in the area, if they find the\nfuselage, it\u2019ll likely be a truly tough retrieval of whatever they can bring\nup. The only slight positive in that respect is that it looks as though it\nwould be lying on the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, which would mean that the\naverage water depths there are about 3000 meters (the Air France plane was\nlike 4000 meters down).\nVery lonely place indeed. While they all would have had 238 others to converse\nwith, that\u2019s hardly the point and little consolation.\nAMSA\u2019s news out of Australia saying a satellite located a little something-\nsomething in the S. Indian Ocean coincides neatly with this finding of a\npossible contrail shadow. It also places the debris along the arc defined by\nthe pinging satellite.\nSeeing the raw imagery, I can see what they theorize could be a possible\ncontrail shadow. But had I been reviewing that imagery myself, I don\u2019t believe\nI would have detected it.\nAdding in this potential correction\u2026  \nIf those points on the map are indeed the satellite pings of Flight 370\u2019s\nengines, and if the plane was still flying at significant altitude, it could\nlikely drifted onward a distance further from that last ping. That being the\ncase, the plane then want be found on the Southeast Indian Ridge; it could\nhave passed beyond that and have ended up in the South Indian Basin, and then\nyou do have waters that are 5000 meters deep, which is deeper than where the\nAir France flight was found in the Atlantic. And also, that would put the\nplane no longer in what\u2019s officially called the Indian Ocean but rather in the\nSouthern Ocean, only about roughly 350km from Antarctica.\nI seriously doubt that anyone would\u2019ve been \u201cconversing\u201d with anyone; I think\nthey were likely all dead long before the plane reached that point.\nAnother adjustment here\u2026 I think that 5000 meters is overstating it. It\u2019s\nprobably more like 4000 meters, which makes it more or less the same as with\nthe Air France plane.\nRegarding the various flight simulator theories.\nI will be very surprised if they find out he actually used that for training\npurpose for carrying out such a stunt.\nYes, the Flight Sim is close to real when it comes to instruments and how to\nfly the plane, but its not even close to real when it comes to his real flight\nexperience and the training hes done in a REAL simulator during his years as a\npilot.\nThe scenery in flight sim is very basic and unless you buy add on programs for\nthe specific area you want to fly and land in (if its available at all\u2026), you\nwill not be able to recognize the area when you go there in real. Much less\ntrain for a crazy landing.  \nAnd training for a landing on water is useless in this kind of simulator\n(again compared to his real experience and training for such a scenario).\nHe had all the training and experience he needed and using a pc game for\nanything like this is unthinkable.\nWhy did he delete the files? Pure coincidence. Dont we all delete files now\nand then? But one thing is for sure, he did not delete those files to save\nspace on his disk. You could have 1000 files like that and it would not exceed\n10MB. A guy with an advanced pc like that would NOT run out of space due to\nflight sim files.\nHe loved flying and used his flight sim as a hobby.\nPatrick, you responded to me but you\u2019re posting is not visible to everyone\nelse, and you\u2019re just asking why they would do this. How would I know, I don\u2019t\nthink like a criminal, but obviously for criminal reasons, to your question of\nwhy.  \nIf you watched the Ed Schultz show yesterday, which Capt. Tom was on, he\nbasically had the same idea that I did without specifying which country they\nwould have landed in.\nIt makes a lot more sense than most of the other hairbrained theories.  \nBy the way, that would not be a James Bond type of plot, James Bond was\nsupposed to be a good guy.\nJust referring back to what backpacker said about the delay between the\nsatellite sending a transmission and the response being received back at the\nsatellite. It seems to me that for a satellite at 35000km altitude looking at\nan arc 4000km away, the required accuracy in the timing to see a plus/minus\n1000km accuracy in distance would be about 700nanoseconds, ie 700-one-\nbillionths of a second. So lets imagine that the satellite \u201cpings\u201d the plane.\nThe plane\u2019s reply is delayed by say 1-microsecond. That would imply that the\nplane was actually much closer to the satellite\u2019s location projected onto the\nEarth\u2019s surface, which would be somewhere in the Indian Ocean. One possibility\nthen is that the plane suffered a catastrophic failure. It was redirected by\nthe pilots to the azimuth of the closest airport. Pilots overcome by smoke and\nplane continues straight ahead into the ocean, and does not make any turns to\nthe north or south. Seeing that there is no apparent motive for crashing or\nhijacking this plane. This would also seem the most logical possibility.\nI can\u2019t figure out why almost no one has noticed this, but it would be very\neasy for the plane to stay over water and out of radar coverage and fly around\nthe South tip of India and then make it into Pakistan or even Iran on 6 to 7\nhours of fuel at normal cruising speeds. Not a stretch at all. I did a rough\nplan of the route on skyvector.com and it would be easily doable.  \nRemember two Iranians were on the airplane with stolen passports and\nsupposedly their background checked out clean, but background checks don\u2019t\nalways mean much.  \nFood for thought.\nYes with 1 fatal flaw. The SE corner of Iran is approximately 2900-3000 miles\nfrom the last waypoint. At 500 mph, that\u2019s 6 hours -> less time if they drive\nfaster. The last ping was 5.5 hours after the waypoint, so yeah, its doable,\nmargin of error, etc.\nUnfortunately for your theory, that last ping places them on a 40 degree\nmeridian away from the satellite which would put them in the NW corner of Iran\ninstead of the SE corner. That\u2019s at least 1500 miles (3 hours) further, if not\n2200 miles.\nSupposing they were maxing out at 535 mph, they still wouldn\u2019t have had enough\ntime to fly all the way up the gut of Iran to get to where the pinging\nsatellite says they\u2019d have to be\u2013even within standard deviation of error.\nRegarding the \u201chide under another jet\u201d \u2026how close was this other airliner? A\n\u201cstern chase\u201dtakes a lot of fuel and time, all the while 370 is still\n\u201cvisible\u201d. If a high aspect intercept is required then at least a 2- 3 g\nintercept would be needed.\nI believe its \u201chide in the shadow of another jet\u201d not \u201chide below another\njet.\u201d From the point of view of ground-based radar, that so-called shadow\nwould be above the other plane. Shadow vessel trails a little bit to mirror\nwhere other vessel is going and keeping out of sight so other airliner would\nnever see it unless its pilots were diligently studying their rear-view\nmirrors(!). My round-number WAG is < 1000 feet, maybe 500'. At 500 mph that\nmight seem close, but think about how close the Blue Angels fly to each other\nmaneuvering at high speeds.\nEven though transponder is off, the pilot is eaves-dropping on conversations\nthe other jet is having with flight control towers so that he can anticipate\nand shadow any moves. Adrenaline would be high flying this close and that\nwould keep pilot awake and alert.\nStern chase wouldn't necessarily take much time since jets often don't go full\nspeed. They need to make their gate on time, not ahead of time. MH370 could\nhave taken a proper pursuit angle, timed its run to meet them at the pass or\neven beat them there but at a higher altitude.\nI\u2019m not informed on all the facts and I have no master theory but\u2026.\nIf you wanted to knock everyone on a flight unconscious (No calls)could you\nraise the elevation to 45,000 feet, ask you co-pilot to check something in the\nback of the plane, put on your oxygen mask and depressurized the plane?\nCouldn\u2019t you kill everyone at 45,000 feet doing this? Would the oxygen masks\ndrop? Can they be disabled? Might you say \u201cgood night\u201d before doing this?\nAccording to Patrick, the short answer is, yes.\nThe pilots could do this. The pilots have access to far more oxygen than the\ncrew/passengers who only get about 20 mins worth under the assumption that the\nplane can easily be flown down to an altitude where oxygen is sufficient (10k\nft) within that time frame. Should the pilots be unable or unwilling to do\nthis, those using the drop-down masks will soon become unconscious once the\noxygen runs out.\nNote, also, with the masks deployed, the passengers are pretty much tethered\nto their seats. They will be far less capable of rushing the cabin without\nhaving a mask on.\n\u2026the mystery of moving posts, that is!\nWhen replying to an upstream comment, if you mistype the reCAPTCHA response,\nthen when you try to re-post with another reCAPTCHA response, your comment\nwill appear at the very bottom of the blog (most recent comment) rather than\nafter the comment you intended to address.\nWhy was the malaysian air force not deployed when the Transponder was  \nturned off/failed.Surely this would be a sure indication something was amiss\nespecially as radio contact was also lost.\nEXACTLY !!!!\nThe fact that MH370\u2019s first deviation was to the west means it is not on the\nsouthern arc. If the person flying the plane wanted to go south, he or she\ncould have turned south immediately. The initial turn to the west means the\nplane went north and somehow avoided detection by military radars.\nThe arcs are not flight paths, they are estimates of where the plane could be\nat its last ping; the plane could be anywhere on that arc (not just the end of\nit). The accuracy of the arc will be determined by the precision of the timer\non the satellite.\nSo the plane could have swung west, then south and then east back to Australia\nwhere the flight path hits the arc estimate.\nOK, how about the following scenario:  \n(1) Pilots put in several new coordinates to fly around some  \nturbulence, but they mix up lat and long (rookie move, but I know I  \nhave done it too). This adds a way-point way north of Norway and one  \nway north of Finland.  \n(2) Fire or depressurization hits, knocking out everyone.  \n(3) Plane turns toward hard left on schedule and then turns again more  \nto the north\u2026.crashing somewhere in the Himalaya (in a remote  \nlocation).\nWhat about hallucinations which may have been caused by oxygen deprivation?\nInteresting suggestion. Could a fire cause a failure of the environmental\ncontrol system resulting in a slow lowering of cabin pressure? The pilots\nwould have to have not noticed the issue to still be able to give the \u201cgood\nnight transition\u201d after confusing the coordinates, but before the plane turned\nleft.\nThe pressurization alarms will go off whether the depressurization is rapid or\nslow. Slow is far better \u2013 more time to put on masks.\n[\u2026] time or the means to send a distress signal? We really don't know for\nsure. But keep in mind that pilots are taught to \"aviate, navigate,\ncommunicate\" \u2014 in that order. Meaning their #1 priority is flying (and\nsafety). #2 is direction. #3 is communicating with ground [\u2026]\nIn a single place aircraft, like an F-16, the call to ATC declaring an\nemergency is done WHILE maintaining AC control and following EP\u2019s. If memory\nserves, MH 370 has a two person crew\u2026\nOf course. It would have taken less than 5 seconds for one of the pilots to\nkey up and say \u201cMH Three seven zero we have fire stand by.\u201d\nI disagree, Art. If they were dealing with a serious smoke or fire situation,\nI can easily imagine them not getting around to a radio call.\nExactly, that is why they have given an arc around a satellite location as the\nbasis for the search area. They measure how long it takes to get the ping\nresponse and convert time to distance to establish the arc. The plane could be\nanywhere along that arc that it would have the fuel to get to. From what we\nknow, the satellite only has the time response data, and no targeting/locating\ndata.\nMy 2 head-scratchers are still:  \n1) Unless they have significant other data, why have the ruled-out the missing\nmiddle segment that include Malayasia itself? Flight could be a huge circle\nreturning to Indonesia or Malaysia.\n2) Why not release the intermediary, hourly ping information? Those pings\ndefinitely are puzzle pieces.\nMy preceding comment was an intended response to Richard at 304,\n\u201cAlso, unlike some reports, the pings do not include location information.\nThis would explain the two disparate course they are now searching. My guess\nit that they are reconstructing the path by communication transit time\n(converted to distance) to the satellite and other factors. Geometrically this\ncould generate multiple paths in opposite directions.\u201d\nI agree about the intermediate pings \u2013 they would eliminate some confusion,\none would think.\nI was also thinking that I cannot imagine the satellite manages clock time\ndown to anything more precise than milliseconds. Plus/minus one millisecond\nwould be plus/minus 186 miles.\nStandard clocks on GPS satellites know time to 1 nanosecond (1 billionth of a\nsecond).\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370 fell where indicated working with Petrochemical\nplatformy.Airplan dived steeply, so went into the water nose not\nrazrushilsya.Poetomu no debris, no spill topliva.amolet stuck in the ground\nand the nose is worth vertikalno.Ili other accident?\nThe evidence, thin though it is, suggests that this is a mass-murder and\nsuicide by the co-pilot, with an attempt to wipe out all evidence.\nThe course changes were programmed before the co-pilots\u2019 last message\n(according to ACARS). This required training. It could not have been done\nwithout the captain knowing it. The captain was a last minute addition to the\nflight, so it\u2019s unlikely that they were working together. The captain was\nprobably killed or locked out of the cockpit.\nThe copilot waited until the ATC handoff, said his \u201cgoodbye\u201d, then shut down\nthe transponder and probably ACARS, flight entertainment (satellite phones)\nand data recorder at that point.\nThe plane went to 40,000\u2032 and was depressurized to neutralize anyone else\nwithin seconds. Pilots have a pressurized oxygen mask, no one else does.\nThe plane then followed the autopilot aiming for the deepest point underwater,\nor the furthest point from land, making recovery as hard as possible.\nAfter two hours, the cockpit voice recorder looped over the events and at this\npoint the co-pilot could pull the circuit breaker for that too.\nWhen the fuel almost ran out, he could put full power on the throttle and aim\ndown to have the strongest impact. This would have the greatest chance of\ndestroying the data recorders AND the emergency radio locators (which is why\nwe didn\u2019t get a distress signal).\nIn 777\u2019s they have pretty advanced FDRs. They can record for many hours, have\ntheir own power, and are in the tail of the aircraft physically away from the\npilots.\nBecause of so many variables involved, we have to also consider the multiple\nand various intertwining combination of things going on, a confluence of two\nor more of the possibilities: accidents, coincidence, failure, coverup,\ndeliberate hijacking, etc.\nWith this in mind, I remember there was one piece of news that I saw a few\ndays ago that havent seen reported on again \u2013 that this red-eye flight was\nalso a sort of training flight for the young co-pilot, such that certain\nhypothetical emergency scenarios were either programmed into the computer or\nin other ways given to the co-pilot. I dont know how involved the pilot would\nhave been in terms of programming stuff into the computer or purposefully\nacting like we was turning electronic equipment off. Anyway, that piece of\nnews reminded me of one of things that occurred on the day of nine eleven \u2013\nthat there were some secret NORAD exercises going on (can be found on\nwikipedia under \u201cUnited States government operations and exercises on\nSeptember 11, 2001\u201d) which confused people about whether the hijacking was\nintentional or a friendly exercise. It represents a confusion between military\nand civilian plane craft activity in relation to in-air computer simulations,\nand it in the case of MH370, I wonder if the the plane computer was programmed\nwith all these kinds of ups and downs, turns and waypoints. This is more a\nquestion of a plane expert. What is involved in these kinds of training\nflights in terms of what is programmed in the cockpit computer and could that\nhave been a possible variable?\nSounds pretty farfetched. The media likes to make a big deal out of a co-pilot\nhaving \u201conly\u201d 2700 hours (roughly) of logged flight hours. It\u2019s a shame that\nthe media doesn\u2019t put that in context for people.\n2,700 hours is still a heck of a lot of flying. You don\u2019t get certified to fly\npassenger jets\u2013let alone huge ones on intercontinental flights\u2013unless you know\nwhat you\u2019re doing.\nLet\u2019s put it in context.\nI trust a 27-year old surgeon with 2,700 hours of operating room experience\nplus prerequisite schooling to perform surgery on me.\nI trust a 27-year old mechanic with 2,700 hours of experiencing fixing\nvehicles plus prerequisite schooling to fix my car.\nI trust a 27-year old veterinarian with 2,700 hours of practice plus\nprerequisite schooling to be able to treat my dog.\nI trust a 27-year old pilot with 2,700 hours of experience, who is certified\non the jet that I am a passenger on, and who has graduated from a specialty\nschool dedicated to his profession, to get me safely from point A to point B\nwithout needing more practice.\nI could go on but you get the point.\nThe co-pilot had thousands of hours of flight time. He was certified to fly\n777s. In short, he knew what he was doing. Yes, I\u2019m sure he went through\ncontinuing training like all pilots do, but they have simulators for that.\nThey don\u2019t need to do it on almost fully loaded jets in the middle of the\nnight.\nBut you airliner pilots can correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\nWell, to be fair, and as I wrote about in the very blog post you just\ncommented on, in North America it would be unheard of to be a first officer on\na 777 with 2,700 hours.  \nIn these parts, to be taken seriously as a candidate with a major carrier, you\nneed at good 5,000 hours or so \u2014 most of which would have been accrued flying\nfor other commercial carriers. And that\u2019ll get you a first officer\u2019s slot on a\n737 or A320. You\u2019ll maybe get to fly a 777 at some point before you retire!\nI understand about the hours (excellent article by the way). I live in the US\nand I\u2019m grateful when I fly for the rigorous training and experience the\npilots have. My point / question though isn\u2019t about the hours, it\u2019s about in\nflight training. The whole frenzy people make over the first officer\u2019s hours\nflown is just a pet peeve.\nWould any major airline deliberately mis-program their flight systems on an\nintercontinental flight that has passengers on board?\nBy trade I\u2019m a network engineer for a company with a global network and\nbillions (with a b) of customers. I can\u2019t imagine mis-programming our\nproduction equipment to test someone. And I just have to worry about outages\nand media exposure, not lost lives.\nI\u2019m not an airline pilot though. Would they do something like that?\nWell I do not agree with this statement. Working for Lufthansa has allowed me\nto fly A330 just after 2000 flight hours and B747 after 4000. I know some\npilots that waited much longer and some that could fly 747 after 2500 hours\u2026 i\nbelive we should not take it general.  \nSome pilots become captains after 5000 hours and I know pilots with 20000 that\nare still sitting right\u2026 so let\u2019s not make rules out of this\nthis red-eye flight was also a sort of training flight for the young co-pilot\u2026\nI, too, saw that bit the other day about a possible training exercise. Perhaps\nmanually entering codes is part of the training? (\u2026deferring to Patrick).\nPerhaps this was the Captain\u2019s means of coercing the FO to do some of the\nwork? Or even have FO fly the plane while the Captain was entering so-called\n\u201ctraining codes\u201d?\nI\u2019m still not on-board with the suicide option, but if it really were\ntraining, couldn\u2019t the Captain present a training scenario that the proper\nresponse would be for the FO to go below deck to check for or put out a fire,\nor whatever, just to get him out of the cockpit and then lock everyone else\nout?\nOK, I\u2019m just making stuff up here, but the training bit could help explain a\nlot of the maneuvers, twists, turns, inclines, declines. Yes, they have\nsimulators for that, but its one thing in a simulator, its quite another up in\nthe sky. At night. Over water. Compared to daytime, its more disorienting,\nfewer visual references, greater reliance on equipment, fewer passengers awake\nto complain.\nThis appears to be the place to obtain answers to questions that have been\nannoying me about the disappearance of the Malaysian passenger jet. Facts are\nthin on the ground whilst, as time passes, speculative theories become facts\nand more and more outrageous.\nOne of the few facts we know is that the systems used to identify flight MH370\nwere disabled during the initial part of its flight. We also know that Thai\nmilitary radar tracked an unidentified plane; the Thai military have stated\nthat, whilst they observed an unidentified aircraft, it posed no threat to\nthem, did not attempt to enter their sovereign airspace, therefore no action\nwas taken by them. I\u2019m wondering, is there an established protocol for\nhandling an unidentified aircraft that does enter your sovereign airspace\nbecause one of the other facts we know is that an unidentified aircraft did\nenter Malaysian airspace, the aircraft Malaysia assume was flight MH370, which\nmeans that some action / decisions must have been taken. One would have\nthought that the Malaysian military would have attempted to contact the\naircraft, ask it to identify itself and explain its intentions? If no response\nwhat next, scramble fighters? Attempt visual communication? Then, if not\ncompliant, what next? It appears, to me, to be inconceivable that the\nMalaysian military would allow an unidentified aircraft to firstly enter then\npass through its airspace and then allow it to merrily go on its way.\nThe other question I have regards the hundreds of Smartphones on the aircraft,\nforgetting their cellular ability for the moment, many would have been left on\nalong with their gps facility. My understanding is that gps devices comunicate\nonly one way, not two way, so as a means of establishing location they\u2019re\nuseless; useless until they communicate that information through a cellular\nnetwork, hence the reason I can see where I was, or at least where my phone\nwas, yesterday, last week or last month via systems such as Google maps\nlocation. When the unidentified plane flew back over the Malaysian pennisular\nwhy didn\u2019t some of these phones become visible to these systems as we all know\nphones do work when flying over a land mass.\nFinally, the unidentified plane / planes observed by Thai and Malaysian\nmilitary, how is it possible to identify them as flight MH370 or is it just an\nassumption on their part?\nLet\u2019s keep Thailand out of it. They didn\u2019t say it was MH370, they said they\nmonitored an unidentified flight that wasn\u2019t a threat to them. They\ncorroborated with the Malays.\nThe Malay military is in a no-win situation in a region that strongly grasps\nsaving face. They can\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t see the flight, but they also\ncan\u2019t say that they did see it but did nothing.\nTo date, the Malays haven\u2019t looked competent at much of anything in this\nmatter. Its just as likely that they never saw it, that they saw it and didn\u2019t\nknow what to do about it, or even they knew what to do, but didn\u2019t do\nanything. Who knows, maybe their jets weren\u2019t fueled up, or pilots were at a\nTailhook convention, or, or, make up 1,000 other stories\u2026\nRegarding smartphone gps while they were over a land mass, a quick question is\nin order. Is smartphone gps derived from satellites or from cell phone towers?\nIf its terrain-based cp towers, then they might not be trained toward the\nskies to catch smartphones whizzing by at 500 mph 5 miles overhead. Also I\nbelieve they need 3 simultaneous points to triangulate a location.\nIt is impossible to identify an aircraft by primary radar. They knew where it\nwas last and knew all others in area, because they all had their transponders\nON. Pretty simple to use process of elimination to know it was MH370.\nHere is what happened: the captain is enraged about his party\u2019s political\nleader/ hero going to jail accused of sodomy. He has just seen the trial live,\na mockery of justice, totally humiliating.

End of the story.\nHello Captain Smith,\nThanks for your hard work to provide smart and thoughtful analysis on MH 370.\nA question on the electrical fire theory: don\u2019t we also think that the plane\nwas aloft for many hours after the transponder was turned off?

Even with an electrical fire,\nit seems the plane was aloft long enough that we would expect a captain or co-\ncaptain to ATC a message, is that not so?\nThanks again for sharing your knowledge with us.\nBest,\nChris\nHere is what happened: the captain is enraged about his party\u2019s political\nleader/ hero going to jail accused of sodomy.

Yes.\nFire theory is bunk. Come on, it isn\u2019t consistent with what is known already\nabout the disaster. The plane continued to make several programmed course\nchanges at GPS waypoints hours after radio communication was lost. Obviously\nthe fire theory cannot be correct. Also the last known position of the plane\nfrom the satellite pings is inconsistent with this theory. I was hoping for a\nbit better than this, Mr. Smith; I\u2019ve read your column with interest for\nyears, but lending credence to this obviously wrong theory that has been\nmaking the rounds of the Internet is really below your standards, or should\nbe.\ndid anyone checked for the earthquakes,plate tectonic movements on those areas\nwhere the aircraft is suspected to be drowned,,sometimes after crashing into\nsea it might got burried by the earth ,i dnt think tht the transponders can\nwork beneath the earth\nIt\u2019s possible that the coverup is really just stalling. China, the US etc are\nprobably not only searching for the plane but for other countries that have\nsuch bad attention to their own radar coverage that a plane can turn onto\ndiffernt flight paths, drastically change altitude and go unnoticed. It\u2019s\nobviously a huge security hole for any country in range of them. And Malayasia\nor the US can\u2019t really say outright that the plane was not evading radar but\nscreaming for attention.\nMalaysia has an airline alliance with China. Do they share responsibilities?\nWhy is that everybody is willing to post a theory about a missing flight but\nnobody contemplates a coverup?\nIt\u2019s been 10+ days \u201csearching\u201d for something it may very well be hidden on\npurpose.\nIadmit to fire theory but if and when the flight disintegrates the already\nlight parts of the plane become lighter making floating on the ocean easy\nbecause of buoyancy. And ocean water is dense. So it would have parts floating\nfor days if not weeks.\nThe blog referred to in post 374 offers the most plausible scenario for a\ndiverted flight. MH370 went west on a programmed flight path to the general\ntime and vicinity of a flight from Singapore to Spain. With transponders off,\nMH370 could have flown just above or below the Singapore flight and remained\nundetected to it and ground radar. By listening to radio comms, MH370 could\neasily follow the same path, effectively shadowing it.\nThe Singapore flight\u2019s route took it right over Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nParts of Pakistan are in turmoil, and there are 3 airstrips in Taliban control\ncapable of landing a 777. People at Boeing believe the jet is in Pakistan\n(Even though transponders were off, keeping MH370 off of cockpit displays, the\nSingapore flight\u2019s computers still might have noted an object nearby).\nIf this jet is in Pakistan, and I believe it is, the plan may have been to use\nit in an attack on Israel, which has been on a heightened state of defense.\nApparently they have suspicions.\nThe biggest reasons no one would want to believe this very plausible scenario\nis it is too damn scary to consider.\nOMG You guys from Israel are such unscrupulous individuals. You are always\ntrying to shine on the news with the most outrageous ideas. Sometimes very\nstupid ones. For real.  \nHow is that a country which is very used to warfare on a daily basis will fear\na hijacked flight as a doomsday scenario?\nHave a little decency for the family of the missing crew and passengers\nPLEASE!?!?!?\nI am not from Israel, I\u2019m not even Jewish. I just understand the reality that\nsome people want to wipe Israel off the map.\nre: the fire theory\nIsn\u2019t the fire theory still plausible even with the turns at various waypoints\nthat occurred after the langkawi airport heading? Couldn\u2019t they have\nintentionally programmed the turns ahead of time incase they missed the\nairport?\nHow do you try to get the attention of ATC with no communication system,\nknowing the crew may be incapacitated at that point and without flying over\npopulated areas in case you crash?\nWouldn\u2019t you fly at altitudes not used on normal flight paths, stay over water\nas much as possible while turning frequently? And wouldn\u2019t it be easiest to\nprogram these turns at waypoints?\nIt seems like they could have intentionally programmed this behavior in (or\nsome of it) in case the landing failed before their death to serve as a red\nflag. And it was totally missed by military, etc.\n\u2026 and the final flight path after the turns, whatever that was, ended up being\nerratic after auto-pilot and the computer began failing.\nThe fire hypothesis has problems unless reports are wildly incorrect (always\npossible, but I think going too far here):\n* The pilots would have needed to decide to use the autopilot to revector. Seems unlikely they\u2019d be interested in a nice, slow smooth turn if they were looking to get on the ground ASAP. But maybe they wanted hands free to deal with stuff, AND had the time/composure to enter the codes. And in a fire, how do they know it\u2019s not the autopilot, or about to take the autopilot out? A real pilot could say: in a fire situation where you\u2019d be disabling electronics, would you put your trust in the autopilot or have one person flying the plane and the other dealing with everything else?\n* If they did revector and were incapacitated, I presume after passing the target the autopilot would either a) loop back to it, ad nauseum, or b) continue on a straight line waiting for a new waypoint, or c) (if it was \u2018inserted\u2019 without cancelling existing ones) head off for Vietnam. I suspect a) isn\u2019t how it works, and c is very unlikely and would have caused it to make a hard/unusual turn while still on radar (and they\u2019d know). \n* The problem with b) is that apparently it continued to go to additional waypoints until out of radar coverage. Certainly they\u2019d have noticed if it straight-lined past the first waypoint and kept on that heading until out of coverage. And the 8am ping indicates it went north or south after leaving coverage. So b) just seems to fail on all sorts of levels, leaving nothing.\n* Lots of improbabilities around which equipment was apparently disabled and what apparently kept working.\nI\u2019m not the only one saying this:\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/18/mh370_disappearance_chris_goodfellow_s_theory_about_a_fire_and_langkawi.html\nMy thoughts on this from the beginning was that something incapacitated the\ncrew and the plane flew on uncontrolled until it crashed or ran out of fuel.\nThe fact the plane turned toward the nearest large airport (Langkawi)suggests\nthe crew knew their was a problem and tried to divert.\nMy thought is did the plane suffer a rapid decompression that incapacitated\nthe crew. After the incident the plane climbed to 47000 feet, well above the\nlimit of the 777. It then dove to 23,000 feet, then erratically moved up and\ndown for a period. This suggests to me the plane was flying uncontrolled, and\nstabilized at it\u2019s equilibrium altitude after a roller coaster ride. I have\nlimited flying experience, but I do know most planes will fly themselves if\ntrimmed previously for straight flight, even without an auto pilot working.\nCould this have been an explosion in the cockpit, or maybe the windshield blew\nout causing havoc on the bridge due to decompression??\nI feel like typing this in caps lock, but I`ll behave.\nPatrick, seriosuly\u2026you gotta stay away from CNN. Although I always knew what\nyou were referring to when you wrote in your book that the media is misleading\nthe public when they write about aviation, I have never seen or heard so much\nbullshit as Ive done when tuning in to CNN.\nLike tonight with Don Lemon, that id***.  \nWhen you were trying to calm down the speculations, he almost seem irritated\ncause you are \u201cruining his case\u201d. Or whatever he is thinking.\nWhenever there is a LOGIC statement that doesnt match their crazy speculations\nthey seem to shut it down and interrupt.  \nThey just LOVE to speculate and throw out the most hilarious theories.  \nIn fact, the only theory I havent heard so far from CNN, is that the plane\nlanded on the moon. Im waiting for it though.\nI was so furious tonight when that guy said he preferred to be on a US\ncarrier. As if they are so much safer than anyone else.  \nPatrick, Im glad you agreed with Richard Quest on this one. You have been\nflying all over the world and know the truth.  \nAlthough Don Lemon did his best to interrupt that part too!  \nThe only reason Americans (ref; CNN) think US carriers are more safe than\nothers, is probably because they dont even know the name of any other carrier.\nIgnorant much!\nThanks for doing your best to bring balance in the discussion, Patrick. Its\njust too sad you dont get enough time on air to speak out.\nWhen did or how often does Malaysian Airline Company Dispatch  \nExpect to hear from flight 370? It is my understanding that normally an\nairline such as Delta, United, etc, periodically communicate with their\nairlines while in flight. They might be communicating a request for passenger\ninformation, gate change, a change in anticipated weather ahead. I have not\nheard any reporting on communication between Malaysian Airlines dispatch and\nflight 370. Is that considered normal?\nPatrick.  \nThanks for breathing a little realism into the CNN circus. They certainly have\nengaged a few clowns.\nChinese cell phones dont have voice mail, and as someone who has lived in\nBeijing for over 10 years, I know that whenever the phone is off, there is no\nring, there just isnt. And the Chinese twitter accounts QQ just wouldnt be\nshowing online, that is really bizarre. The telling thing is that there were\nso many hi-tech guys on board, including Chinese hi-tech senior executive who\nsurely had state secrets, they must have tried to find a way to send out\ne-communication, unless of course they had no chance. This for me is a sure\nsign of the sudden depressurization theory. If there were so called jammers on\nboard, wouldnt they have also jammed the pings from the AWACS?\nSpeaking of AWACS pings, one of the reasons that was given about how it was\npossible for the satellite to no longer receive any more pings was if the\nplane left the line of sight of the satellite by the curvature of the planet.\nNever mentioned if ping would have been transferred to another more proximate\nsatellite, or if there were one at all in either of those two directions.\nAnyway, I would suggest there to be two circular radius drawn, one showing the\nlimits of a jet fuel, and another one showing the limits of that satellite to\nreceive pings.\nACARS, not AWACS. They are 2 completely different controls.\nSatellite is miles and miles above the earth, much higher than jets fly. So\nhow far would jet have to go to have contour of earth interfere with\nsatellite? Too far.\nThere are other geo-synchronous satellites up there as well. No one has\nreported that any other satellite has a reading from MH370.\nCell jammers are specifically designed to only cause interference on the cell\nfrequencies. Shouldn\u2019t effect other electronics.\nCould the mumbling that was heard by the other plane have been the\npilot/copilot/hijacker speaking through an oxygen or smoke hood?\nPatrick just saw you on The Kelly File, great info. Each theory has some holes\nmostly because lack of clear info\u2026 but pilot suicide appears least possible. I\nagree a small chance of mechanism failure but mostly hijack. Update I doubt. I\nalso think if plane turned before it was dumb move for it to be pilot AND\nlucky chance radar/Malay air control ignored the oops this plane is turned and\nin wrong direction. No one on ground questions when call for good nite occurs?\nI believed from the beginning that the aircraft slowly depressurized and the\nflight crew, as they were being slowly overcome with hypoxia, switched off\nTCARS in their delusionary state and reset the autopilot to a different\ncourse: all along thinking they were taking the correct action. Hypoxia can be\nvery insidious being it affects almost everyone different. Euphoric feelings,\nacting drunken etc., are some of the signs. If this was coming on slowly they\nmay have been incapacitated before they realized what was happening if they\never did realize it. In their Nitrogen induced hallucinations they thought\nthey were doing the right thing, climbing to FL 45 Thousand, descending to\nFL29Thousnd. or one pilot passed out first leaving the co-pilot to try to fix\nthe problem in his inebriated state, making the weird last call to ATC\u2019\n\u201cEverything\u2019s Fine, good night\u201d, or whatever he said. The flight flew on its\nnew course until it ran out of fuel and fell into the Indian Ocean. It\u2019s\nhappened before. \u201cHELIOS Greek Airliner\u201d, \u201cPayne Stewart\u2019s Private Jet\nCharter\u201d. When I heard of the FAA Advisory about the SATCOM Antennae and its\npossible repercussions to decompression and aircraft loss. I thought of this\nright away. Arc hems Razor\u2026the simplest explanation it usually the right one.\nI think Mr. Spock said that also.  \n\u2014the writer is a private pilot with over 2000 flying hours.\nIn wayback USAF times I had a decompression chamber checkout in hopeful\nanticipation of a Mach 2 ride in an F-106. Alas, that never happened but I\nrecall from the test that the effects of hypoxia are exactly as Anthony\nwrites.\nSo are you implying that there is no pressure gauge/monitor/warning system in\nthe cockpit? No alarms going off alerting the pilots ahead of time about their\nown impending toxic Hypoxic conditions due to inadequate cabin pressure?\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be a viable theory.\nPatrick, I just took a look at what the guys at TIGHAR were saying (definitely\nsome aviation knowledge in that group) and while they don\u2019t rule out pilot\nsuicide, they are seriously considering this as a sophisticated cargo\ngrab\u2026that is still in process.\nI think we have to respect that perspective.\nHi, two questions:\n1\\. how long would it have taken the co-pilot (with the help of crew members\nand passengers)to break down the cockpit bullet-proof door if he had been\nlocked out of the cockpit by the pilot?\n2\\. if a passenger had an iridium satellite phone on him/ her\u2026wouldn\u2019t he/she\nhad been able to place a phone call from the plane?\nthanks.\nHere\u2019s my analysis of what might have happened. Looking into the technical as\nwell as the circumstantial elements of the case is very important.\nhttp://crazymotts.blogspot.in/2014/03/what-happened-to-malaysia-airlines.html\nHere\u2019s a scenario which I still believe is the closest to what really\nhappened:  \nhttp://www.wired.com/autopia/2014/03/mh370-electrical-fire/\nThat is it! And sincerely, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking all along. And\nelectrical malfunction and quite possibly caused by a fire if not specifically\nan electrical fire. They were all either dead by the time the plane crossed\nthe Malacca Strait or seriously incapacitated. Who knows when or if the plane\nwill ever be found, but if there\u2019s any evidence left to analyze by that time,\nI\u2019d put my money on some scenario very similar to what\u2019s described by Chris\nGoodfellow.\nI read that Australian working on an oil rig in the South China Sea saw a big\nfireball in the clear sky about the time the plane is reported to have turned.\nHe gave his position in detail and said he tried to send the information by\nemail to authorities about this, but there was no reply. He then emailed the\ninformation to his superiors at the company he was working for on the oil rig.\nWas this ever checked out for a possibility? I have not seen anything else\nabout it.\nI\u2019ve often thought about that, and even though it really seems to fit, at the\nsame time I can\u2019t see how it does. If there were some fire that an oil rig\nworker could see, you\u2019d have to think that it would be an engine fire. And I\ncan\u2019t see how the plane could\u2019ve kept flying for so long if that were the\ncase. For it to be an electrical fire, I don\u2019t see how someone on the ground\n(or on an oil rig) could possibly have seen it at that elevation.\nHowever, if it were something original related to a fire with the landing\ngear, I suppose that one way the pilot might try to extinguish it would be to\nopen the landing gear; and in doing that, then perhaps someone on the ground\nmight possibly see the flames in the sky on a clear dark night. But hey, I\ndon\u2019t know if any of that is even possible.\nhave a theory, What if the plane is now drowned between india and somalia?\nHow?  \n1) Satellite points to either the plane had move south or north from the\nstraight since north is heavily guarded and has military activies am reducing\nthe possibilities.

Then hw will do it somewhere between best of\nkerala and mumbai but not very close as there are radars tracking so somewhere\npredetermined point between india and africa.  \nSenario of safe landing:  \n1) An area full of pirates may be there was a pirate ship waiting for the\nplane and then transferred the passengers to different voat and then took off\nsinking the plane with small explosives small enough to sink the plane.  \nSenario 2: the plane sunk end of story.\nIndia and Somalia are both too close to the geo-synchronous satellite; that\nsatellite is about half-way between India & Somalia almost exactly where you\nare pointing to.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_information_tones\nThis is by far the the most logical explanation \u2013 I just read it on\nbusinessinsider.com\nChris Goodfellow\nA lot of speculation about MH370. Terrorism, hijack, meteors. I cannot believe\nthe analysis on CNN \u2013 almost disturbing. I tend to look for a more simple\nexplanation of this event.\nLoaded 777 departs midnight from Kuala to Beijing. Hot night. Heavy aircraft.\nAbout an hour out across the gulf towards Vietnam the plane goes dark meaning\nthe transponder goes off and secondary radar tracking goes off.\nTwo days later we hear of reports that Malaysian military radar (which is a\nprimary radar meaning the plane is being tracked by reflection rather than by\ntransponder interrogation response) has tracked the plane on a southwesterly\ncourse back across the Malay Peninsula into the straits of Malacca.\nWhen I heard this I immediately brought up Google Earth and I searched for\nairports in proximity to the track towards southwest.\nThe left turn is the key here. This was a very experienced senior Captain with\n18,000 hours. Maybe some of the younger pilots interviewed on CNN didn\u2019t pick\nup on this left turn. We old pilots were always drilled to always know the\nclosest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Airports behind us, airports\nabeam us and airports ahead of us. Always in our head. Always. Because if\nsomething happens you don\u2019t want to be thinking what are you going to do \u2013 you\nalready know what you are going to do. Instinctively when I saw that left turn\nwith a direct heading I knew he was heading for an airport. Actually he was\ntaking a direct route to Palau Langkawi a 13,000 foot strip with an approach\nover water at night with no obstacles. He did not turn back to Kuala Lampur\nbecause he knew he had 8,000 foot ridges to cross. He knew the terrain was\nfriendlier towards Langkawi and also a shorter distance.\nTake a look on Google Earth at this airport. This pilot did all the right\nthings. He was confronted by some major event onboard that made him make that\nimmediate turn back to the closest safe airport.  \nFor me the loss of transponders and communications makes perfect sense if a\nfire. There was most likely a fire or electrical fire. In the case of fire the\nfirst response if to pull all the main busses and restore circuits one by one\nuntil you have isolated the bad one.\nIf they pulled the busses the plane indeed would go silent. It was probably a\nserious event and they simply were occupied with controlling the plane and\ntrying to fight the fire. Aviate, Navigate and lastly communicate. There are\ntwo types of fires. Electrical might not be as fast and furious and there\nmight or might not be incapacitating smoke. However there is the possibility\ngiven the timeline that perhaps there was an overheat on one of the front\nlanding gear tires and it blew on takeoff and started slowly burning. Yes this\nhappens with underinflated tires. Remember heavy plane, hot night, sea level,\nlong run takeoff. There was a well known accident in Nigeria of a DC8 that had\na landing gear fire on takeoff. A tire fire once going would produce horrific\nincapacitating smoke. Yes, pilots have access to oxygen masks but this is a no\nno with fire. Most have access to a smoke hood with a filter but this will\nonly last for a few minutes depending on the smoke level. (I used to carry one\nof my own in a flight bag and I still carry one in my briefcase today when I\nfly).\nWhat I think happened is that they were overcome by smoke and the plane just\ncontinued on the heading probably on George (autopilot) until either fuel\nexhaustion or fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed. I said four\ndays ago you will find it along that route \u2013 looking elsewhere was pointless.\nThis pilot, as I say, was a hero struggling with an impossible situation\ntrying to get that plane to Langkawi. No doubt in my mind. That\u2019s the reason\nfor the turn and direct route. A hijack would not have made that deliberate\nleft turn with a direct heading for Langkawi. It would probably have weaved\naround a bit until the hijackers decided on where they were taking it \u2026\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/malaysia-plane-\nfire-2014-3#ixzz2wLD5xEFA\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/malaysia-plane-fire-2014-3\nSo I\u2019ve been certain it was a suicide run, terror-related or personal. And I\nfully expected it to be found in short order somewhere near the end of the\nsatellite arc in the Indian Ocean, 1,000 miles off of Perth.\nBut then I read this: http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54062\nI guess it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s guess.\nColor me skeptical, if you like, I\u2019m unaware of the light quality.\nIts 1600 miles to Kudahuvadhoo. Would it be light enough for them to see color\n& detail on a red-eye flight? Flying west, they are racing away from the\nsunrise; though sunrise may seem to come earlier over water.\nPassengers phones have been connecting but not answered. A relative to the\nvictims stated \u2018If I could get through, the police could locate the\nposition\u2019.. I\u2019m sure if the phone is connecting you don\u2019t need it to be\nanswered. If its ringing its on, if it\u2019s on it can be located. An iPhone or\nany other GPS phone can be located by just about anyone.\nI heard an expert on TV debunking this, claiming that just because there\u2019s a\nring on the dialer\u2019s end, that does _not_ mean you are actually reaching that\nphone.\nIf a mobile phone is OFF, there is either; a constant tone or the network\nproviders unavailable message NOT a connecting tone.\nActually that depends on how your provider set it up.  \nIn my provider case, it just rings as if you\u2019ve reached the other phone. But\nafter ringing a few times comes the recorded message telling the phone is\n\u201cturned off\u201d, \u201cout of reach\u201d,\u201dnot answering\u201d or whatever. So those might just\nhave gotten the default behavior from dialing a turned off or out of reach\ncellphone from their providers.\nWhich kind of navigation equipments need landbased contact and which may work\nindependently of such contact?\nThis is my theory \u2013\nIt was the crew \u2013 and they are currently in Somalia \u2013 during the refueling\nprocess they gave the airline the data for enough fuel to travel to Beijing \u2013\nhowever they instead bribed or told the fueling mechanic to give the plane\nmore fuel. The mechanic has not come forward because of fear of loosing his\njob, getting in trouble ect. They proceeded to fly the normal path \u2013 then \u2013 we\nall know the rest of the story. Transponder was turned off, the flight turned\nleft turn towards the Maldives and flew at 5,000 ft toward Somalia.\nWhat about the passengers? They are currently being held hostage. While over\nthe ocean whomever was in control of the plane took all communication devices\nfrom the passengers and placed it in the electronics bay while they were\ntampering with the ACARS system.\nNo one has claimed responsibility because the plane is currently hidden in a\nhanger, under a camouflage netting, or already flown to another region. I\nbelieve the plane and the passengers will be held for ransom, the plane will\nbe sold on the black market, or it is already being repainted and outfitted\nwith explosives.\nThis is my theory \u2013 please poke holes to it, give me your thoughts, lets\ndiscuss it.\nA) you would not need to take anyones cell phone while in the air over the\nocean, no cell towers.\n2) Held for ransom by someone that has not bothered to send a ransom note?\niii) Assuming they could get a 777 down & hidden in Somalia without anyone\never picking up a hint of it, further pretending the plane could be repainted\nand outfitted with the doomsday device \u2013 where would you propose the target\nwould be? You don\u2019t think the sudden appearance of a 777, particularly one not\nbehaving in an expected way sending the expected signals would somehow slip\npassed all the air defense systems to hit . . . what location? Maybe the DRC\nbut it other than that the thing would be met with fighters & very possibly\nremeoved from earthly existence\nI like what you did there, up to a certain point.\nIts easy enough to see how, with a enough baksheesh, someone could get\nadditional fuel to get to so many more datapoints on the far side of the\nsatellite map\u2026along the 40 degree contour line pinging from the satellite.\nThis supports an unstated, yet over-arching premise of your theory which is:\nthe jet could be a lot further afield than anyone imagines!\nWe would throw out the old constraint of \u201chow far could they fly with the\namount of FUEL they had?\u201d and replace it with the new constraint \u201chow far\ncould they fly in the amount of TIME they had (additional 5+ hours until the\nfinal ping)?\u201d\nYour idea works in principle (which is more important anyway) but not in\nspecifics. Primarily, Somalia is too close to the satellite. So are Maldives,\nSeychelles, Madagascar, Yemen, Oman, Iran, and all but the northern fringe of\nPakistan.\nNew places on the 40 degree meridian could now include S. Kazakhstan,\nUzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, NW border of Iran, SE Turkey, NW Iraq,\nSyria, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Chan, Central African Republic, DR Congo,\nAngola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, & Swaziland. Do any of those\nplaces sound suspicious for any reason? I think they could reach any of these\nspots with a full fuel load.\nI have NOT done the math to see which of these places they would have had the\ntime to get to.\nAnother thing: you mentioned them flying at 5,000 feet. That could be a radar-\nevasion tactic vs land-based radar but is not needed over the relatively empty\nIndian Ocean. In fact, they\u2019d get better air-speed and go further if they were\nflying at standard 30-34,000 elevation due to thinner atmosphere.\nSomething else that weakens your original premise is speculating on other\nspecifics such as hostages, cell phones, ransom, black market, repainted, &\nexplosives. You\u2019ll get further working it out 1 piece at a time.\nEdit: End paragraph 4 with \u201cOman, and all but the NW fringe of Iraq & Iran.\u201d\nFarfetched plot ??  \n1-Turn off some of ACARS comm modules.  \n2-Turn off transponder.  \n3-OK Goodnight.  \n4-No voice contact with Viet.

It entered radar coverage already in the radar shadow of\nthe other 777, stayed there throughout coverage, and then exited SIA68\u2019s\nshadow and then most likely landed in one of several land locations north of\nIndia and Afghanistan.\u201d\nhttp://keithledgerwood.tumblr.com/post/79838944823/did-malaysian-\nairlines-370-disappear-using-sia68-sq68\nKeith Ledgerwood\u2019s idea sounds a lot more plausible than many of them I have\nread.\n[\u2026] il pilota e blogger Patrick Smith continua a rispondere alle varie domande\nche circolano in rete (il Boeing 777 \u00e8 un aereo sicuro?

Wouldn\u2019t those previous pings, in\nsequence, give us a better notion of the flight path, either north or south,\ngiven the last Malaysian radar contact?\u201d\nTycho B asks:  \n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Inmarsat released the other \u201carcs\u201d so that we could see the\nplane\u2019s progression over 7 hours?\u201d\nAccording to the New Straits Times (here:\nhttp://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/font-color-red-missing-mh370-font-plane-\nflew-low-to-avoid-radar-1.516965):\n\u201cInvestigators are also calculating to determine how far the aircraft may have\nflown and the possible landing sites.  \n\u201c<>  \n\u201cData harvested from Inmarsat was not able to do that as the static satellite\ncould only detect the pings at a 40o angle.\u201d\nI am not sure how reliable this remark is \u2013 it is attributed, unsurprisingly,\nto \u201csources close to the investigation\u201d, and it has not been circulated by any\nother news agency. However, if it is accurate it implies that all 6 pings\nreceived by the geostationary Inmarsat-3 F1 satellite at 64.5o E (35,800 km\nover the Indian Ocean) were measured to have a dip angle of approximately 40o.\nIt is this dip angle that was used to construct the first \u201carc\u201d map published\nby the Malaysian government on 15 March\n(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BiwklVICcAAl2YV.jpg:large). If the dip angles are\nall the same then the arcs will all lie on the same circle, hence there is no\nneed to publish the others.\nThis added information, if true, invites many other unwelcome conclusions\nhowever. The first of the series of 6 pings was received by Inmarsat-3 F1 at\n3.11 am Malaysian time, and it is well nigh impossible that MH370 could have\ntravelled from its point of last radar contact off Penang at 2.15 am to any\npoint on the 40o circle in under an hour. Nor is it likely that the plane\nwould have travelled along a route that kept it at pretty much the same\ndistance from Inmarsat-3 F1 for the next 5 hours.\nSo either the New Straits Times is wrong, or the angle measurements deduced\nfrom the Inmarsat-3 F1 data are unreliable \u2013 meaning that the red arcs are\nfantastic and anyone intending to search them is off on yet another wild goose\nchase.\nWhat if the radar observations are wrong? If the plane continued it\u2019s flight\npath it would pass the ring of the satellite, where the last ping contact took\nplace. This area has been ruled out because there is so much radar coverage.\nBut how good is/was that radar coverage realy? Is it not possible that the\nradar contact that the militairy saw was actually from an other unidentified\nplane? Maybe a spy plane or a plane involved in drug traficking?  \nAlso with such an experienced pilot it would not be inconcievable that if the\nplane was put down over water it would have been put down intact. Maybe it\njust sunk, which would explain the absence of debris. Everybody could be\nsearching in the wrong area\u2026..  \nSo far every theorie voiced on the news is so far feched and searches are\ncoming up with nothing to substanciate them. I would suggest going back to the\ndrawing board!\nPatrick \u2013 I imagine you are quite busy these days answering a lot of question\nand I have another one for you. You say:\n\u201d There are hundreds if not thousands of business jets and cargo planes out\nthere, traveling the world more or less anonymously, that would be equally\nsuited to such a scheme.\u201d\nWouldn\u2019t the military watching their radar just assume, if MH370 flew a\nrecognized flight path, like SQ68, that it was just another one of those more\nor less anonymous flights, especially if it didn\u2019t deviate from the path and\ntherefore, posed no immediate security threat. Also, I have been delayed on\nflights a lot \u2013 would the commercial airports notify the military that one of\ntheir flights was deviating from their normal travel time?\n[\u2026] 7. \u201cA rapid loss of cabin pressure rendered the flight crew, and possibly\neveryone else on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane\ndeviated from its course before eventually crashing.\u201d (Ask the Pilot) [\u2026]\nJust wanna share it.\nFor a look at the 777-200 flight deck checkout this page:\nhttp://meriweather.com/flightdeck/777/fd-777.html\nIs this credible explanation?\nA Startlingly Simple Theory About the Missing Malaysia Airlines Jet\nhttp://www.wired.com/autopia/2014/03/mh370-electrical-fire/\nMaldives island residents report sighting of \u2018low flying jet\u2019\nhttp://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54062\nHai sir, inviting your attention towards this news portal.\nhttp://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/54062\nAlthough I am not in aviation I have taken a keen interest in the\ndisappearance of this flight. I kept on coming back to Patrick\u2019s website and\nblog for inside info of what actually happens in the cockpit. First of all a\nplane going down always leaves me traumatized because of the sad loss of life\nand the heart ache of family members of the deceased. However in scrutinizing\nthe news hoping that the plane is found, I came across the two guys from Iran\nwith stolen passports and to my dismay found the photos which were so badly\nfaked.

Looking at info on this\narticle the following stands out:\nhttp://www.pisau.net/russia-puzzled-over-malaysia-airlines-mh370-capture-by-\nus-navy-prayformh370/\n(Cellphones were jammed)\nCritical to note about Flight 370\u2019s flight deviation, GRU experts in this\nreport say, was that it occurred during the same time period that all of the\nSpratly Island mobile phone communications operated by China Mobile were being\njammed.  \nChina Mobile, it should be noted, extended phone coverage in the Spratly\nIslands in 2011 so that PLA soldiers stationed on the islands, fishermen, and\nmerchant vessels within the area would be able to use mobile services, and can\nalso provide assistance during storms and sea rescues.\n(Could this also jam the communication systems on the plane? Probably not.)\n(Airplane remotely controlled?)\nAs to how the US Navy was able to divert Flight 370 to its Diego Garcia base,\nthis report says, appears to have been accomplished remotely as this Boeing\n777-200ER aircraft is equipped with a fly-by-wire (FBW) system that replaces\nthe conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic\ninterface allowing it to be controlled like any drone-type aircraft.\n(Found on this website)  \nhttp://www.maxresistance.com/new-world-order-highjacked-flight-370/\nWhat could make a plane disappear from civilian radar while at 36,000 feet yet\nstill be visible on military radar?

Although North\nKorea is NE of the plane\u2019s original destination they would need to approach\nthe country via Mongolia in order not to be identified en route. These\ncountries are sopposed to be friendly states but with North Korea being so\nunpredictable one cannot know what private tiffs they may have. There are\nprobably a number of airfields in N Korea where the plane oud land without a\nproblem.\nDon\u2019t think so. While North Korea is wildly unpredictable, China is their BIG\nBrother, their friendly protector and/or sponsor.\nI understand that all US-built airliners have been fitted for many years with\ntechnology intended to enable \u2018the authorities\u2019 (US) to take over an aircraft\n\u201cin distress\u201d. [\u201cBush announces new airline security measures\u201d (PBS)].\nThe program was subsequently classified as confirmed in the 9-11 hearings.\nHaving just watched an insightful BBC report into the political instability in\nMalaysia being caused by the missing aircraft \u2013 a government not used to being\ncriticised by its people and a people not used to asking questions of its\ngovernment \u2013 I was wondering if we finally have a means and a motive.\nBy all informed accounts, the known behaviour of the aircraft since the last\nvoice communication was so sophisticated it must have been carefully pre-\nplanned, or rather pre-programmed, down to flying along the exact border of\nthe Malaysian ATC area, possibly flying at 45,000 ft for a time to render the\noccupants unconscious, before joining standard flight corridors but mid-way\nbetween adjacent standard cruising altitudes (as the collision avoidance\nsystem would have been innoperative). My best guess would then would be the\ncraft took the southerly route then carried out the perfect \u2018miracle on the\nHudson\u2019 style landing in deep sea about as far from land as anywhere could be\nand sank without trace.\nFinally, I like the fact that it is a US plane that has just been assigned to\nsearch that area. Will it be found and evidence planted to give a new public\nnarrative or quietly ignored to make the current Malaysian regime look\nincompetent?\n\u201cI was wondering if we finally have a means and a motive.\u201d\nAllegedly the pilot agrees with the opposition movement against the long-\nstanding regime. The opposition leader was recently jailed day(s) prior to the\nflight. So maybe the pilot wanted to do his part to help discredit the\ngovernment? #paybackisabitch\n\u201cMy best guess would then would be the craft took the southerly route then\ncarried out the perfect \u2018miracle on the Hudson\u2019 style landing in deep sea\nabout as far from land as anywhere could be and sank without trace.\u201d\nYou completely lost me here. To have such a complicated plan RELY on a mid-\noceanic \u201cMiracle in the Hudson\u201d event seems folly.\nbumped to 380\nThey cant be sure that the transponder and ACARS were turned off at different\ntimes, and yet they still believe foul play was involved. This seems to me\nthat hijacker scenario has become supported solidly from various other pieces\nof evidence. This leads me to think the depressurization theory sounds right.\nAn article discarded the idea that the hijacked flight\u2019s quick rise to 45k\nright after the turn westward was not to depressurize the cabin and make\nunconscious the passengers, under the reasoning that the hijacker had already\ngone through great lengths to be so deceptive and the people\u2019s lives were\nvaluable to the hijacker, such that it wouldnt make sense to depressurize the\ncabin, but rather give some explanation to the passengers. However, this\ndoesnt smell right.  \n1\\. I think with dramatic ups and turns, the air crew would have checked in on\nthe pilot and if the flight path monitor became disconnected and unviewable\nfrom passenger seats, suspicion among the steward crew would grow.  \n2\\. The hijacker sounds like he had a detailed plan. As I read elsewhere,\n\u201cEvery action taken by the person who was piloting the aircraft appears to be\na deliberate one. It is almost like a pilot\u2019s checklist,\u201d said one senior\ncaptain from an Asian carrier with experience of jets including the Boeing\n777. So, the quick rise would likely have been part of the plan, with a\nspecific purpose \u2013 disorient the passengers and crew.  \n3\\. Not likely that all of the 200+ passengers were of use to the hijacker, as\nhe would have to keep them all alive and feed them, shelter them and worry\nthat they dont try to escape. It is possible that a few of the passengers were\nvaluable to the hijacker, such that the hijacker could go and collect these\npeople and give them oxygen through mask/tank. But also possible that the\nhijacker after going through great lengths to get this far, didnt want to risk\nanything, like passenger phone calls, passengers breaking down the door, or\nstewards trying to relay an emergency signal to ground control. Likely that he\nwanted all the passengers out of commission.  \n4\\. For motive, I suspect a person like this hijacker, who is obviously\nsomeone who was highly technically skilled and trained, and technologically\nsophisticated enough to carry out this operation, the hijacking was actually\nnot about the people, but rather the electronic equipment and cargo of key hi-\ntech passengers, that is, the secrets and technology on board. I know\ninvestigators are combing through background checks and psychological\nassessments, but have they any clue about the content of the electronics on\nboard. What exactly were those people working on in Malaysia, what were they\nbringing back?\nOutstanding Questions:  \n1\\. If we go with the idea that the hijacker had a meticulous checklist plan,\nwouldnt he have turned off the transponder first before turning west? That is,\nhe (I\u2019m using he, but could be a she) would have become transponder invisible\nfirst in order to further create the image of an in-air accident, rather than\ndivulge that the plane was changing course. Maybe there was a fight? Any other\nexplanation?  \n2\\. Going with the theory that MH370 shadowed SIA68 in order to be\nundetectable as a separate blip in the radar map, couldnt the military radar\nrecords show not only altitude and direction but also speed, and therefore be\nable to judge if the pace of the plane was done in a way that would be\nconsistent of getting ready to fall behind SIA68?  \n3\\. How reliable is their conclusion that the co-pilot was the one who said\nthe final good night? Are those communications recorded? The image that comes\nto mind is Han Solo acting like a storm trooper when they were rescuing Leia\nin the Death star.\n[Quote]today, Malaysia Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya stated\nthat the ACARS system, which communicates every 30 minutes, was still active\nat 1:07 a.m., but failed to send its next scheduled update at 1:37 a.m. Thus,\nthe system could have been disabled at any point within the 30 minute window.\nAs a refresher, the plane\u2019s other communication system, its transponder,\nfailed at 1:21 a.m.[/Quote]\nI\u2019m pissed at all the mis-information there\u2019s been in this story. The above is\nexactly what I was saying the other day when the report came out that the\nACARS system was turned off before the transponder spotted sending messages.\nThat\u2019s simply not known, and finally that mis-information is being cleared up.\nAnd now we hear that at least part of the plane\u2019s change of course was\ncomputer manipulated, not manual manipulation. Again, leading at least to the\npossibility that someone else could\u2019ve altered the plane\u2019s flight plan.\nI understand why the transponder can be turned off \u2013 but why not either\nrequire a ground based monitor to OK or inquire why and have some override to\nstop it. Alternatively, I would think in the age of redundency it would be\nfeasible to have a second independent system that would turn on or be turned\non remotely in the event of a manual shutdown which is suspicious. Think of\nthe time, lives and money that might be saved with such a back up system.\nMaybe even some of the hit of 911 could have been adverted with a quick\nresponse that could have been guided to the hijcaked planes. I am simply not\nwilling to accept he easy asnwers given that it is for safety and electronic.\nEven Appolo 13 found a way to solve its problems and make it home safely.\nSome questions that I don\u2019t see the media asking:\nWhy didn\u2019t the Emergency Locator Transmitters ELTs go off upon contact with\nthe water? Is this normal is airplane crashes? Can they be disabled by a\npilot?\nCan a pilot depressurize a cabin and kill everyone? Some sources say yes,\nothers say no.\nWhy hasn\u2019t Inmarsat released the other \u201carcs\u201d so that we could see the plane\u2019s\nprogression over 7 hours?\nCould any weather satellites see the plane\u2019s contrails, or any spy satellite\nsee the heat signature at night?\nHave any of the passenger\u2019s cellphones connected to any cell tower in any\ncountry after the transponder was turned off?\nWill Boeing remove the capability of turning off ACARS from their software?\nThe NYT has just reported that the change of flight path was programmed in the\ncockpit. (That would be 9:30 PM eastern time, 3/17)\nI need help understanding something:\n1 \u2013 the ACARS system, even disabled, still pings the satellite about every\nhour\n2 \u2013 we have maps of where the LAST ping was, in long arcs over Asia and the\nIndian ocean\n3 \u2013 what about the previous pings? Wouldn\u2019t those previous pings, in sequence,\ngive us a better notion of the flight path, either north or south, given the\nlast Malaysian radar contact?\nWhat am I missing?\n\u2014-  \nOn another note, can someone please loan me a large round red rubber nose to\nsend to Malaysia\u2019s Transport Minister for him to use during \u201cPress\nConferences\u201d?\n3 \u2013 what about the previous pings?\nThat\u2019s been my question too. I wonder if those previous pings would give a\nfinite range of probable flight paths where authorities and computers could\nmathematically interpolate the end destination? We could both be mistaken\nthough.\nI\u2019m starting to think that the last 2-3 waypoints already indicate a herky-\njerky, evasive flight pattern. If the pilot kept up such a pattern, then extra\ndatapoints might not be indicative of anything ~ though it would eliminate\nsome of the furthest end-points.\nQuestion:  \nThe arc pics from the Inmarsat satellite data floating around from the 8:11\nLAST ping to the Rolls Royce engines place the plane on one of the two lines\nin Asia or West of OZ.  \nNow \u2013 should there also be other pings, e.g. an hour before at 7:11, and a\nping two hours before 6:11, and so on, thus we should have multiple arcS at\ndifferent times and potential locations. Just the last arc is shown on news.\nThe earlier satellite ping data combines with last radar and min/max flight\nspeeds would narrow down the area on the last arc and give an idea of\ndirection. I see none of this. I thought it pinged hourly? Should not there be\na series of arcs from the satellite data? Can someone explain this?\nhttp://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/03/16/mh370-positions.jpg  \nhttp://tvaraj.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/satellite-contact-map-by-sergio-\npec3a7anha-archie-tse-and-tim-wallace-source-malaysian-\ngovernment.jpg?w=584&h=478\n[\u2026] 7. \u201cA rapid loss of cabin pressure rendered the flight crew, and possibly\neveryone else on the plane as well, incapacitated, at which point the plane\ndeviated from its course before eventually crashing.\u201d (Ask the Pilot) [\u2026]\nPatrick, someone shared this on my Facebook wall:\nhttp://keithledgerwood.tumblr.com/post/79838944823/did-malaysian-\nairlines-370-disappear-using-sia68-sq68\nSomebody basically suggested that MH370 was able to fly under the radar by\ntagging behind SQ68 (another 777) that was in the vicinity at the time. Is it\npossible?!?!\nI\u2019m inclined to agree with you \u2013 that the plane is lurking somewhere at the\nbottom of the ocean. I was just curious what you thought of the above\nsuggestion!\nWondering if anyone has thought of the pets possibly traveling on MH370 and\nimplanted tracking devices under their skin that are turned on when pet goes\nmissing for tracking company to locate them. Pets may have traveled in cargo,\nor with passenger under seat, and may not have been declared, too.  \nAlso, ex inmates, ex military special ops types, even diplomats might have gps\ntracking and may not even know it.  \nKids sometimes have this done to prevent missing children problem. May be\nadults now and may still have tracking chip.  \nLuggage sometimes has this, kids backpacks. Needs to be activated by tracking\ncompany to locate it.\nAs far as I know, the chips implanted in pets are RFIDs without a battery and\nthus transmit using the power of the scanning device (otherwise you\u2019d have to\nexplant to change the batteries). In general, the type of battery powered\ntransmitters that you are talking about will only broadcast a few hundred\nmeters at most. (The kid locator devices work off the cell/wi-fi bands \u2013 no\ncell or wi-fi point nearby, no location). The FDR would likely have the best\ntransmitter on board the aircraft and even that battery will be dead in about\n30 days.\nThere\u2019s only one possible suicide angle that might fit\u2026 Again, going on the\nidea that perhaps one or both of these pilots were coerced into doing some\nterrorist act by someone threatening him with killing their family members.\nThe suicide angle might then work like this, for instance\u2026 The pilot kills his\nco-pilot, then flies the plane so high (45,000 ft) so as to seriously\nincapacitate or kill the passengers, and then the last part of his mission was\nto crash the plane into the Petronas Towers, but before doing it he became so\ngrief-ridden with all that he had already done that he decided to fly the\nplane where no one would ever find it, committing suicide in the process, and\nhopefully his family and no one would ever know what he had done. Also hoping\nthat those who had threatened to kill his family would not follow through and\nthink that he just failed in his mission.\nThe mystery is indeed fascinating as it seems more and more that this was a\nwell planned operation. Whether it went according to plan or not I don\u2019t know.\nThere is a lot about this that reminds me of a John Nance novel \u2013 Scorpion\nStrike in which a military aircraft enters a country by undetected, and does\nso by turning off all communications, and the hiding in the shadow of a\ncommercial airliner.\nStrikes me that the planners of this operation, picked their timing at the\nhand-off to another ATC, in an area with little radar coverage, in a location\nthey could switch to another airway. As outlandish as it seems, I\u2019s be giving\nthis serious consideration that the aircraft did evade military radar and did\nfly the northern route. I suspect it has been seen on radar, just not\nrecognised \u2013 maybe a radar return masked by another aircraft.\nI haven\u2019t figured out the motive. But somebody might tempt you with several\nmillion to deliver a 777 to an organised group. My thinking, it has to be\ninside job of some kind.\nAnyway \u2013 read the part of Scorpion Strike where they do this \u2013 makes you\nwonder.\n[\u2026] A pilot can shut the whole thing down by disconnecting a circuit breaker,\nand the plane\u2019s manual would tell him how to do it. That\u2019s for good reason,\nPatrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential, wrote on\nhis blog: [\u2026]\nSomeone tried to overtake the plane for nefarious purposes and the pilot(s)\nflew & ditched it into the South Indian Ocean to avert higher death toll, much\nakin to what the 9/11 captain did in the PA field.\nI don\u2019t see a cloaking device as being plausible. The US is the most advanced\nwhen it comes to radar-evasion technology but any look at stealth aircraft\ndesign tells you that it isn\u2019t a problem overcome purely with electronics. For\nas long as there has been radar there have been attempts to defeat radar and\ndecades of research gets us smaller, interesting looking airplanes (and\nboats). And we\u2019re talking massive R&D costs too. So maybe China might be in\nthat game. Regardless I don\u2019t see any government testing it on a commercial\naircraft.\nThe potential flaw with theory that the Chinese shot the plane is that it was\napparently pinging long after they would have first cleared Chinese airspace.\nIt was daylight by the time the plane stopped pinging, easy enough to get a\nvisual on a MA 777 by any fighter group sent to shoot it down.\nI think the southern ocean route(s) are really the only options.\n\u201cIt was daylight by the time the plane stopped pinging, easy enough to get a\nvisual on a MA 777 by any fighter group sent to shoot it down.\u201d\nI\u2019m not so sure it was daylight over western China at the last ping; China\nonly has one single timezone (Beijing time), which means the sun comes up very\nlate out in Xinjiang.\nWhat gets overlooked is what if the government (in this case China, but in\nreality any government including India, Iran, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh,\nKyrgyzstan, Myanmar, etc) wanted/expected/invited/arranged ahead of time for\nthat jet to enter its airspace?\nThen they would have no reason to mention to the world any relevant radar\nevidence of the plane. Just saying\u2019\u2026\nI\u2019d be interested in an informed opinion on this piece:\nhttp://v4v6.cnn.com/2014/03/16/opinion/palmer-malaysia-\nflight-370/index.html?hpt=hp_t1\nAbsolutely everyone else has been saying for days that an experienced pilot\nmust have been guiding the plane. Is it really possible that the flight just\nhappened to make turns at known waypoints? The piece doesn\u2019t address that\u2026\nNo. I don\u2019t imagine that a jet would randomly turn at a waypoint toward the\nnext waypoint. Especially after coincidentally losing its communication system\nexactly in the dead-space between leaving Malay air control and Viet Cong (ok,\nVietnam) Air Control. There\u2019s a significantly higher probability that it was\nALIENS! (I\u2019m NOT suggesting anything alien, just using the analogy to point to\nhow slim the odds are of so many improbable events happening in lockstep\nprogression)\nA much simpler explanation is that those waypoints were programmed into the\nflight control panel or else the jet was manually directed there by someone\npiloting the plane. For example, someone with 20+ years flight experience in\nthe region would know the locations of those markers.\nYour March 17 update appears very misguided: \u201c\u2026In the meantime, can we please\nstop talking about transponders?\u201d Why? Because \u201c\u2026on Sunday, Malaysia\u2019s\ntransport minister said key communication equipment that keeps the ground\nupdated about the health of a flying aircraft and its engines was disabled on\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370 BEFORE [emphasis mine] the last recorded\nconversation with the cockpit.\n\u201cYes, it was before,\u201d Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Sunday in\nresponse to a reporter\u2019s question about whether the Aircraft Communications\nAddressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, of Flight 370 was disabled before\nsomeone said, \u201cAll right, good night\u201d from the cockpit.\nThe ACARS system being disabled before the last voice message from the cockpit\nbacks up thinking by experts that somebody with intricate understanding of the\nBoeing 777-200 jet and its systems tampered with communication equipment on\nboard.\u201d\nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579441812954932236\nSo it seems virtually certain that the pilot or pilots KNEW the systems had\nbeen disabled before the last voice message.

So for instance, if someone was asleep at the wheel,\nwould they even be able to go back and view the radar from days ago?\nPakistan states they have no information on the plane and that their radar did\nnot detect it. Didn\u2019t they also assure us their country was not harboring Bin\nLaden?\nHow was this B-777 equipped with communications equipment? Did it have HF Data\nLink, SATCOM, HF voice, UHF voice, VHF voice, TCAS, ASCARS (which carrier SITA\nor ARINC), etc.? Was the aircraft configured with in flight WiFi over\nbroadband Satellite communications?\nWhat has SITA or ARINC said about air/ground comms with AFCS/FADEC links?\nThis morning another piece of [perhaps extremely significant] news dribbled\nout of Malaysia\u2013 that the plane may have flown under 5,000 feet. Well, where\nwas THIS information 5-10 days ago?! The flow of information (or lack\nthereof)is so insanely infuriating. Also, could this now change the search\narea parameters?\nI am curious to know the passenger list on this flight as well as what type of\ncargo was loaded. Were there passengers of some importance on this flight?

The amount of bungling under his watch\nand the others in Malaysia with regard to this particular incident is mind-\nboggling(no checks on passports,passengers,crew members,radar\ndetection,communication between his ministry and that of the air\nforce,etc)These people HID actual information that they KNEW the plane went\nelswhere (by way of radar blips detected by Malaysian military) and kept on\ngiving the same load of tripe to the relatives,the press and the rest of the\nworld, in their \u201cpress briefing\u201d where they kept on appearing like rock\nstars,in their fancy suits and neck ties,palm-oil slicked hair, waving and\nsmiling to the press.To me, that is just grotesque.  \nThe relatives and any sane air travellers have every right to be infuriated by\ntheir antics.\nTHE MYSTERY IS FINALLY SOLVED!!!!!!!!\nPeople, gather round \u2014 we NOW KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT\n370 beyond any possibility of a doubt!\nYou can all relax, because MH370 is in the caring, capable hands of the US\nNAVY!

They\u2019d never fish it up from 11 km down.\nTotal mystery. Awaiting next installment.  \nNor have I ever seen Patrick\u2019s blod so alive with self-sustaing comment, i.e.\nidle speculation such as the above.\nSelah.\nThe explosion and flames in the sky sighted by an oil rig worker have not been\ngiven enough weight. An explosion does not necessarily mean the whole aircraft\nwill break apart and there are many instances of localised damage with the\naircraft still flying. I recall an uncontained engine explosion on a Boeing\n767 a few years ago out of Brisbane and remember the Qantas A380 engine\nexplosion? My point is this, if the MH370 aircraft had poor maintenance a\nfaulty generator could have caused voltage drops and taken the ACARS offline,\nbut left the radio working. Pilots may have noticed voltage drops and decided\nto run two generators in parallel. When there are two generators in parallel\ncurrent will want to reverse current flow to the faulty generator, but\nnormally a diode prevents this. When a diode burns out in this situation there\nwill be sudden huge voltage discharge and surge through the electronics,\nenough to cause an explosion and flames, enough to trip off the transponder\nand to rupture the pressure hul and also enough to signal the autothrottle to\npush engines to maximum thrust. This would explain MH370\u2019s clim to 45,000ft\nand has nothing to do with terrorism or pilor suicide.\nSorry if this has been posted before but I tried to read the whole thread and\ndid not see ref to this\u2026..

Just spent the last hour searching for \u201cMarch 16\u201d and reading\nreplies posted on the 16th scattered about. Quite an interesting bit about the\nPetronas Towers.\nHello all,\nIt\u2019s your lunatic prognosticator here again with a new theory \u2014 or at least a\nnew concept. I just got through reading about the Malaysian air force\u2019s\npathetic behavior in allowing this plane, which now we knew they had somewhat\npositively identified (will they ever say? We might never know) to keep flying\nalong its merry way over its own territory, with nary a scramble here or a\nwarning there.\nThe article went on to say that indeed, the US was caught unawares on 9/11 and\nsent its jets out to sea, not expecting an attack from WITHIN.\nThis article also pointed out that far from being a global backwater, Malaysia\npossesses one of the highest-prestige attack sites in the world \u2014 the Petronas\nTowers in Kuala Lumpur.\nI think it is fair to say that they DWARFED the Twin Towers in size and scope.\nSo, why was the Malaysian military not more umm . . . PROACTIVE in seeking out\nour famous \u201cblip\u201d and at least, checking it out?\nNo matter, but this brings out a huge new question: Osama Been waited\npatiently for several years to put his little plot into effect \u2014 the mark of a\ntrue strategist, no matter what a murdering brute he may have been. And we\nknow that \u201csleeper cells\u201d were supposed to have been planted here and there\n(hey, what happened to them? Did they all go to sleep?)\nSO . . . why not the absolutely brilliant idea of taking a young, radicalized\nman when he\u2019s say, 17 \u2014 and then, patiently putting him through flight school,\nin THE TRADITIONAL MANNER, not haphazardly like they did Atta and the rest \u2014\nand then . . . wait. If it took them seven years, it took them seven years.\nIt\u2019s been, may I remind you, OVER 12 years since 9/11.\nSo we get young, enthusiastically Westernized co-pilot, Fariq Ab Hamid, a\n\u201cnice\u201d little Muslim name if I ever saw one \u2014 and train him from the ground\nup. For this ONE MISSION.\nWhat, are you going to tell me \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, they could never pull it\noff?\u201d I\u2019m sure twelve dozen CIA anti-terrorism units would have laughed you\nout the door if you had proposed 9/11 to them on 9/10.\nBut the evidence \u2014 hello \u2014 says that they not only pulled it off, we owe them\nhowever repugnant, GRUDGING RESPECT for their incredible success. I doubt four\nplaneloads of our finest Navy SEALS could pull off such an attack in the\nheartland of Saudi Arabia \u2014 don\u2019t you?\nThis is NOT to be mistaken for admiration for those cockroaches \u2014 it isn\u2019t.\nBut my point, and that article\u2019s point is, what the hell does the Malaysian\nair force EXIST for? Isn\u2019t that PRECISELY why they exist? What, Thailand is\ngoing to pull a surprise attack on them at any time, thus, prepare for the\nworst!?\nThat\u2019s ludicrous. Even our own air force on 9/11 could be thought in some\nminds to have \u201chelped Allah greatly in this operation\u201d by basically being\ncompletely disorganized, and dare I say it \u2014 outwitted and outclassed. If you\nfactor in the sheer ineptitude of the New York fire and police departments \u2014\ntheir radios can\u2019t even TALK to each other, ferchrissakes, they hate each\nother so much \u2014 you will get a situation tailor-mde for good patient folk like\nOsama Done-Been (thank Allah).\nI mean, yeah, he got what was coming to him, after ten years of fruitless and\nblood-soaked muddling around the Islamic world on our part, but that\u2019s no\nconsolation now.\nWhy, then, is it not only possible, but PROBABLE, that Al Qaeda or a satellite\nmight not have planted a Fariq Ab Hamid into our civilian aviation world, in\nthe most innocent-seeming of roles, \u201ca fun-loving, friendly guy who loved\nflying . . .\u201d and then, just . . . waited.\nShades of Manchurian Candidate, sure, but who now actually believes the next\nbig hit is going to come from gels hidden in shoes? The Bad Guys have already\nproven that yes, they can outwit, outwait and outDO us if they so wish \u2014 and a\nlot of them DO so wish \u2014 to the DEATH \u2014 so, my, and that article\u2019s basic\nquestion remains: WHY did the Malaysian military, bungling jerks that they now\nseem to be \u2014 until you look at our OWN military on 9/11 \u2014 not scramble\nfighters IMMEDIATELY upon watching MH370 mosey its transponderless way up and\ndown the Malaysian peninsula, seemingly at will?\nIF the Petronas Towers had been a target (if you don\u2019t what they are, please\nlook them up) in the capable hands of Fariq Ab Hamid, that almost fully-\nfuelled 777 could EASILY have switched directions mid-stream and smashed\nsquarely into those buildings. Considering Fariq Ab Hamid was a FULLY-TRAINED\nand pretty much CHECKED CAPTAIN for the 777, is no one aware what possible\ndamage he could have done at the helm of that plane? I think we \u2014 and\nespecially the Malaysian military \u2014 should be breathing huge, gulping sighs of\nrelief that apparently, THIS time that didn\u2019t happen.\n9/11 happened not because of a failure of resources, not a failure of\nsecurity, not a failure of diligence, but a failure of IMAGINATION.\nHaving 36 F-15s at hand, fully fueled and ready to zoom up in the air at a\nminute\u2019s notice is about as effective as having 20 unarmed Slingsby T67\nFirefly trainers at your beck and call, piloted by a few enthusiastic first-\nyear student pilots IF THEY ARE NOT USED in the capacity for which they have\nbeen INTENDED.\nAlternately said, why even bother with a Malaysian military?\nHindsight is a beautiful woman (or man) but it\u2019s FORESIGHT that we all need,\nin all its ugly possibilities.\nIf you look at this whole thing on some levels, it can be extrapolated that we\njust dodged a HUGE bullet. And again, it\u2019s easy to lambaste the Malaysians for\nwhat they did not do, but were we really any different on 9/11?\nIf you spend years and millions of dollars training an individual to perform a\ncertain task, and when the time comes to perform that task, you are unready,\nunwilling or just downright UNIMAGINATIVE to send him out to do his job, then\nyou might as well have trained a Malaysian lar gibbon in his place rather than\nthe dozens of fighter pilots I assume the Malaysian air force has on hand.\nI\u2019m not saying this was a terrorist plot. Far from it. It was probably just\nsome guy going looney-tunes on us, for whatever reasons \u2014 the Sandy Hook dude,\nthe Newtown dude, the Batman dude . . . but for a looney-tunes guy, whoever he\nis, he has pulled the 400 thread-count wool over the eyes of thousands of\nprofessionally trained and equipped \u201cexperts,\u201d has yet again slammed a boulder\ninto our sandhill of \u201cpreparedness\u201d and has proven that evil does not come\nwrapped in a black box spitting flames or foaming with malice, but rather in\nan ordinary brown-paper package that says nothing except \u201cTo Whom This May\nConcern.\u201d\nI know you don\u2019t want to speculate, but can you list possible reasons for the\nabrupt altitude changes as the plane diverted from its flight plan? Mainstream\nmedia reports have discounted passenger hijacking, assuming that the crew and\npassengers would rush the cockpit if they suspected or knew about it. But what\nif the initial climb depressurized the cabin and knocked out everyone on the\nplane without oxygen masks on? How long would it take them to regain\nconsciousness, and would it give the hijacker(s) enough time to subdue\neveryone?\nI also read that commercial/experienced pilots like to stay at round number\naltitudes, instead of the FL295 the plane was last known to achieve. What do\nyou think of that?\nI don\u2019t want to cast aspersions on ANYONE because of race questions, but it\nwould be my strong bet that because the passengers consisted mostly of Chinese\n(mainland Chinese \u2014 there is a big difference, I would imagine, culturally,\nbetween them and say, Cantonese or other slightly Westernized Chinese) that\nmost, in the face of possibly some uniformed figure barking orders, would be\nmore than reluctant to \u201crush the cockpit,\u201d let alone leave their seats to do\nanything.\nFurthermore, assuming it was indeed one of the pilots who was the perpetrator,\neven a planeload of burly Americans would be so confused by what looked to be\ntheir own pilot taking over the plane, that most would be reluctant to \u201cjump\nthe gun\u201d and disable him. After all, he was their ticket to getting back down\nsafely, alive \u2014 if either of the pilots was the perpetrator, I will wager that\nnot a single soul aboard \u2014 even a security \u201cplant\u201d \u2014 would be willing to\nattack or hurt him.\nTsee thank you for thinking intelligently, between 29,000ft and 36,000ft are\nnormal cruise altitudes. The Boeing 777 service ceiling is 43,100 so to climb\nto 45,000ft is illogical and at the extreme capability of the aircraft itself.\nIn fact at this height the aircraft\u2019s stall speed was so high it matched the\ncruise speed causing the aircraft to stall and tumble to a lower altitude\n(23,000ft)and fly off west.\nIf the cabin was de-pressurised before this illogical climb to 45,000ft, then\nunconsciousness for passengers would have taken minutes followed by death in\ntheir sleep. Pilots could have lasted longer with better oxygen supply but the\nreal question is whether the aircraft was controllable before this crazy\nclimb?\nMy concern is that investigators are ignoring the oil rig worker\u2019s sighting of\nan explosion and flames high in the sky. This almost certainly de-pressurised\nthe aircraft.\nMy theory is that a cascading electrical fault from a faulty generator caused\nan explosion, then commanded engines to maximum thrust and scrambled\nelectrical controls, knocked out the transponder. If the aircraft stalled at\n45,000ft with engines running it could have recovered by itself without\nautopilot or real pilots, since most aircraft are inherently stable and\nrecover with enough altitude and thrust. It is quite plausible for such an\naircraft to wander around the skies with both pilots dead or unconscious.\nPossible reasons:\n1\\. Intentional cabin de-pressurization/murder as you already pointed to  \n2\\. Un-intentional cabin de-pressurization due to some on-board\nmechanical/electrical/auto-pilot incident  \n3\\. Evasive maneuvering to get away from something\u2026expected flight patterns,\nradar, missiles, aliens, whatever anyone might think of  \n4\\. Maneuvers/simulations for Co-pilot certification  \n5\\. etc.\nBefore this missing Malaysian jetliner, travelling south in the Indian Ocean,\nruns out of fuel, cruises & glides at wave height on the ocean, drags the tail\nin the water, before coming to a halt, resting on the water, then slowly\nsinks, there will be no wreckage, isn\u2019t it?\nI have been flying for 45 years \u2014 for 22 years in the Navy and now as a\ncivilian pilot. I have thousands of hours of flight time. Here is what I\nbelieve happened:\n1\\. There appears to have been only 1 flight crew on board the flight (<8 hour\nflight). Assuming this, either the pilot or co-pilot took over control of the\ncockpit and disabled the other flight crewmember;\n2\\. Then the pilot put on his O2 mask and depressurized the entire plane and\nalso disabled the passenger's O2 masks. At 35,000 feet this would have killed\neveryone on board in about 3-5 seconds. Remember the Payne Stewart plane\nmishap;\n3\\. The pilot then turned off 1 of the transponders, followed some minutes\nafterwards by the second transponder. He initially forgot there were 2\ntransponders, but remembered after he spoke to ATC;\n4\\. Because breathing O2 at 35,000 ft can be difficult, the pilot then reduced\naltitude to FL 260 and proceeded to the west. His natural reaction to\ntraveling west would have had him pick an even altitude and at 260, breathing\nO2 in his mask would have allowed the O2 to be absorbed into his blood;\n5\\. The pilot then either traveled to the northwest for a landing site, or,\nmore likely, simply continued to the southwest until fuel eventually ran out\nabout 9-10 hours later. The plane ended up in the vast wasteland of the South\nIndian Ocean where it will never be found and the pilot is in heaven with his\n77 virgins;\n6\\. The reason the second scenario is more likely is that no signals from any\nof the passengers cell phones have occurred which is more likely over vast\nareas of open water (southwest route) than over land (northwest route);\n7\\. It is also likely that years from now, with still no evidence of MH 370's\nwhereabouts, there will be continued speculation over this flight in much the\nsame manner as with Amelia Earhart and Judge Carter.\nMost sensible suggested outcome yet K.C.  \nFor me this might not be an attention seeking plot but it certainly reeks of a\nbit of smugness. It\u2019s so perfectly planned, flying between radars, disabling\ncommunications, my theory is the cabin was depressurised which killed the\npassengers, the plane for over 7 days now has been undetected, I can see the\npilot very proud of his sophisticated knowledge. The world is following his\nmastermind, the maylasian and indeed other world governments and military have\nbeen outsmarted. Maybe that is reason enough.\nI doubt you are due 77 virgins for killing dozens of fellow Muslims. And as\nfar as I know, there\u2019s no jihad declared against China. In general, murder of\ninnocents is a cardinal sin (as with all other major religions). If this were\ndone for fundamentalist religious reasons, this would be a particularly weird\ntarget.\n1\\. Preposterous! When you say flight crew, if you mean 1 pilot and no co-\npilot, I do not imagine they would allow that in a 777. If you are referring\nto flight attendants in the main body, that is equally unfathomable since the\ncustomer-service friendly Malay Air would have more than 1 attendant for 200+\npassengers. Either way, you completely lose credibility with assertion #1.\n3\\. I heard the second transponder was below the deck\u2026I do not know the\nveracity of that claim. If it really is below, you are suggesting that the\npilot took the jet to 45,000 ft, killing everyone else, re-stabilized to 26k,\nleft the cockpit to turn of 2nd transponder all in 14 minutes while under\nlimited air, and on portable O2 himself? I find that incredulous\n6\\. This is a non-sequitor. Cell phone participation is irrelevant whichever\ndirection they flew. Flying at altitude, cellphones would not work well\u2013as has\nbeen mentioned here 40 times already.\nCellphone receivers are pointed toward the ground. We lose connection while\ndriving at 55 mph often enough in rural areas, how much more so when a jet is\nso many miles above down-directed antennae, over water where there are no\ntowers anyway, flying at 500 mph? Passengers in 1st-class could not call\npassengers in cattle-class unless there was some kind of on-board wi-fi relay\ndedicated for phone communication.\nI have a question regarding these \u201cpings\u201d the satellite(s) \u201cpick up\u201d from\naircraft \u2013 at what point do the pings stop? For example, an aircraft in for\nrepairs, inspection, not in the air, etc. Do the satellite(s) still pick up\n\u201cpings\u201d from those aircraft as well?\nThe long flight to suicide in the deep waters of the Indian Ocean may have\nbeen designed to prevent anyone from ever finding the plane and determining\nwhat actually occurred. This could be motivated by the pilot\u2019s desire to not\nvoid life insurance policies that have a clause for no payouts for suicide.\nAlso, an indeterminate end of the flight would leave open the possibility of\nhis family getting legal settlements.\nI assume that all the passengers will be checked for having made any sudden\n(or not-so-sudden) new life-insurance policies for vast amounts of money. On\ntop of that, they will also need to have had the proper training in flying a\n777.\nI think that this investigation could be carried out in about 20 minutes, if\nwe discount infants and children from purchasing huge life-insurance policies\nAND training to become 777 captains.\nThat supposed long flight to nowhere in the Indian Ocean would also tie up any\npurported Insurance settlement for an extremely long time. Insurance would not\npay until the plane was found, the passengers/crew found dead, and the\nrelevant \u2018discovery\u2019 phase fully evaluated.\nRemember, it took 2 years to find the Air France plane and its black box in\nthe Atlantic \u2013> even though they found jetsam on the surface within 48 hours\nof its disappearance.\nSo for your insurance scam theory, you have to consider that claim payout = 2\nyears + investigation/discovery time. The corporate settlement angle would\ninclude up to 10 years in legal wrangling.\nI would think such a desperate attempt would be wanting a more immediate\npayback.\nThe series of missteps, especially by Malaysian authorities, appears to be\nmind-boggling. This would only be a short-term issue \u2013 understanding that we\nare all still sensitive to fates of all aboard, except that there\u2019s still a\n(slim?) chance that the airplane landed somewhere and is being refitted for\nuse as a terrorism device.\nIt has been reported that, amongst other things:\nSome Malaysian authorities knew very shortly after the plane\u2019s continuing\nflight and course changes, due to the radar blips, but allowed the massive\ninternational search to go forward even though it was entirely in the wrong\narea.\nThe authorities did not immediately visit the residences of the flight crew\n(not accusing any of the crew here, mind you) after the plane went missing.\nThere were great discrepancies between the reports of the Malaysian government\nauthorities and military command.\nInternationally, more immediate oversight of Malaysian air transport control\noperations was not demanded.\n\u2026\nNo matter what happens, if any of the above proves true, the international\ncommunity should immediately insist upon extremely tight supervision of all\nMalaysian air transport, both military and civilian, or they should face harsh\nsanctions.\nThe long flight to suicide in the deep waters of the Indian Ocean may have\nbeen designed to prevent anyone from ever finding the plane and determining\nwhat actually occurred. This could be motivated by the pilot\u2019s desire to not\nvoid life insurance policies that have a clause for no payouts for suicide.\nAlso, an indeterminate end of the flight would leave open the possibility of\nhis family getting legal settlements.\nWhy was there no resistance or alarm on the part of the passengers or non-\ncockpit crew? A scary possibility is that the inexplicable ascent to 45,000\nfeet was done to kill the passengers and cabin crew. If the plane\ndepressurizes at that altitude the o2 from the bags isn\u2019t enough. The plane\ncan be depressurized by shutting the engines off. The steep dive after\nreaching 45k may reflect a stall, which depressurized the cabin, and then the\nengines were restarted.\nThank you for this enlightening post \u2013 it is good to know the media is as\nsloppy with reporting in your field as they are in the fields I have trained\nin. This has been a really intriguing story, and I am dying to see how it\nunfolds \u2013 can\u2019t wait for the movie on this Mystery of the Malaysian Airliner\nfiasco. There was a chick over here who had been on board one of those\nMalaysian Airlines flights before, and she said that her and her friend were\ninvited to sit inside the cockpit with the pilots (one of them being the pilot\non the aforementioned missing flight), and they even showed them pics of\nselfies they had taken with the pilots, inside the cockpit, whilst the plane\nwas flying. So, apparently security was pretty lax.\n\u201cChick?\u201d\n\u201cSelfie?\u201d\nThe Summer of Love was 47 years ago and \u201cselfie\u201d is at best, questionable as\nbeing an English word at all.\nThere\u2019s still very little information about what was done after the last ATC\ncontact with MH370. Around 1:38 am both Ho Chi Minh City and KL ATC can\u2019t see\nit on their radars, and ask a nearby aircraft to try to contact, but, per\nreports, they just hear garbled sounds. And then what? They called it a night\nand went home? Search the net and you can find nothing as to what the response\nwas after this point. Who did they call, what did they do? Shouldn\u2019t some kind\nof emergency response be activated at that time? Instead, they wait till the\nmorning to mount the response, and even later to look for where MH370 might\nhave went. Those few hours after 1:38am, nobody\u2019s talking about. A search for\na timeline gets you nothing.\nPatrick,\nWhat is your opinion of the aviation journalist Flying with Fish (tweeting at\nhttps://twitter.com/flyingwithfish)? His theory (as I understand it) is that\nthe pilot flew MH370 to Iran (evading radar detection by trailing very close\nbehind another flight \u2013 also, apparently India\u2019s radar detection wasn\u2019t\nactivated!?!), the 20 Freescale employees were given over to the Iranians, and\neverything remaining (passengers, crew, plane) was eliminated. In this\nscenario the Freescale employees have knowledge that helps the Iranians with\ntheir atomic weapons program.\nOf course it sounds ridiculously far-fetched, but some folks on the\nairliners.net forums are taking him very seriously and he appears to have a\nfair number of sources in DHS and (presumably) elsewhere.\nPatrick,\nWhat is your opinion of the aviation journalist Flying with Fish (tweeting at\nhttps://twitter.com/flyingwithfish)?

The sounds from the point where the plane was taken over\nwere probably recorded over a few times in the hours the plane flew\nafterwards.\nI want to know why the emergency locators didn\u2019t go off when the plan crashed.\nCan they be disabled?\nBecause CVR only records 2 hours. If you fly 6 hours you wipe out whatever\nhappened on the CVR. And you can ditch the plane in 4km deep water instead of\n50m coastal waters. And you can ditch it in an unknown location not in the\nmiddle of busy waterways.\nWha? My last comment inserted 322?! Please go read if you want more of my\nthoughts, ha.\nAnyway, new discovery: easy enough to by cell phone and electronics jammers\nfor really cheap. For under $500 bucks, maybe much less you could scatter 3-5\naround the plane and disrupt all cell service on the plane, whether you are\nflying low near towers or not. I had heard of museums etc., using such systems\nbut did not know how cheap and easy they are to get. Hell, you can buy them\nfor your car so you and your kids won\u2019t be tempted to use the phone while the\ncar is in motion.\nSo can we agree that if any messages were successfully sent from the plane we\nwould have heard about it by now? So that leaves two options:\nThe victims (for lack of a better word but really just anyone who wasn\u2019t\ninvolved in the hijacking) were not capable of sending out any messages. Most\nseem to agree that this would require the shutting off of\noxygen/pressurization to the main cabin. It is definitely the case that the\npilot and cabin systems are separate but I am not sure even the crew has a 7\nhour supply. That might mean extra tanks would need to be smuggled aboard.\nProbably not an insurmountable task. It would be very helpful to know if it\nwould be difficult or impossible to depressurize the plane while in flight\n(well, in a way that wouldn\u2019t make the plane difficult to fly).\nThe victims were capable but failed to get any messages out to any recipients.\nEven if, perhaps especially if, the hijacker(s) were brandishing weapons I am\nsure multiple people would have tried. But the problem is that they just\nweren\u2019t in a place were the cells could connect. Or by the time they realized\n(if the hijack was more subtle) they weren\u2019t in a place to connect (i.e., no\none tried until it was too late). For that matter it would be rather easy to\nbuild/buy (they are pretty cheap really) a jamming device on the cell band\nthat would prevent calls/text from connecting; after all a plane is a\nrelatively small zone. On the other hand, while such a jamming signal would be\nincoherent, I would think electronic surveillance would flag it as unusual and\nworthy of investigation.\nVotes?\nHi I dont know if its been asked before and Iknow very little about\nplanes,could it be possible if the pilots seen a missile coming and turned off\nthe tracking system,the smoke,damage etc from the missile affected the pilots\nthey drifted on ,apparently one media report said an oil rigger seen plane in\nflames at first location.?\nCell service has a limited range. How extensive is Malaysia\u2019s network? And\nbeing miles above, when cell towers are designed for maximum coverage on the\nground, I imagine you would have to be pretty close to a tower to get a\nreliable signal, and even then, at 500 mph, you\u2019d be out of range quickly.\nTwo Muslim pilots up front, two Iranian passengers with stolen id\u2019s, who knows\nwho else on board might have been involved. Add a prearranged destination,\nsome portable ground support equipment and teams ready to go, and it is not an\nimpossible thing to divert this plane.\nDoes anyone know if there are gaps in military/civilian radar on the northern\ntrack suggested by the last ping at 8:11 am that could be exploited by a\nhighjacker to fly without detection into one of the \u2018stans? Have they\ndetermined at what point in the flight the aircraft ascended beyond 40,000\nfeet and for how long it stayed there? Hiw long for hypoxia at that level? Can\npax oxygen be turned off while leaving cockpit O2 on?\nThis could well be the Chinese. The timing of that Chinese satellite image of\nsupposed debris in the Gulf of Thailand came just as there was beginning of a\nshift of attention to the Malacca Strait and the Malaysia military radar\nsighting. That Chinese \u201cmistake\u201d, as it was later called, allowed the\ninvestigation of the plane traveling west to be delayed yet one more day.\nMy guess is that the US and Russians (and plenty of other counries) have\nsatellites with highly developed infrared capacity to detect the launch of a\nmissile. They must also detect hot aircraft exhaust.\nAssuming this is so, and above and beyond all the primary military radar in\noperation near land masses, would there not be records of this aircraft\u2019s\nprogress across the globe after the transponders were turned off?\nWhy does the Malaysian transport guy keep on saying \u201cwe have nothing to hide\u201d\nat each press conference?  \nWhy did the Malaysian police raid the pilot\u2019s residence?  \nWhy does the Americans are searching in the Indian ocean when the\nChinese/Vietnamese/Malays,etc are tripping over themselves in the wrong area?  \nWhat ways can these planes be tracked(known to the Americans, but NOT divulged\nto the rest of the world)?  \nCan somebody within the Malaysian govt be involved in this hijacking(as it is\nnow becoming slowly apparent)?  \nIs the Malaysian govt prevaricating because it knows some radical muslim\nelement has hijacked the plane?  \nWith one pilot inviting women over to the cockpit area, how secure are todays\npassenger planes-security wise?  \nI believe these are the questions we should be asking.\nNew development\u2013criminal investigation:  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-\nflight.html?_r=0\nWe need a \u201cLOST, Flight 370\u201d, forum.\nHere\u2019s an interesting article for those interested in an espionage angle:\nYou Won\u2019t Believe What Spies On Malaysia Plane Were Doing  \nhttp://beforeitsnews.com/events/2014/03/spies-on-missing-malaysia-airline-\nplane-5-major-defense-contractor-companies-26-intel-passengers-2432766.html\nI think the suicide theory is extremely unlikely, and what an inconvenient way\nto do it and why take everyone with you? Can\u2019t imagine this being the case. As\nfor the pilot with the home simulator\u2013if he was up to no good, I think he\nwould have destroyed the evidence prior to trip and certainly wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen photographed smiling in front of it.\nIt is bizarre that this has not been thoroughly investigated however and makes\nme think the investigators are not doing a very good job at all.\nI think the airline went beyond gravity, went to outer space\nOk\u2026Haven\u2019t checked until now on what\u2019s been said since yesterday. I\u2019ll pose\nthe question again for those of you who thinks it\u2019s a suicide.\nWhy\u2026why\u2026why\u2026would someone who wanted to commit suicide\u2026after apparently taking\ncontrol of the plane when the transponders were turned off\u2026then turned the\nplane around\u2026fly for another 6 or so hours, in the dark\u2026instead of just\nditching the plane in the ocean immediately?\nGiven all of the information that\u2019s come out now, I think pilot suicide is the\nmost likely reason for all of this.\nI\u2019m guessing he chose to fly out into the Indian ocean for two reasons. One,\nhe liked flying so much that he wanted to spend his last hours flying the\nplane over the open ocean. And two, he didn\u2019t want anyone to find the wreckage\nso that someone (or multiple people) could benefit from an insurance policy.\nThe whole investigation from now will be concentrating on WHY?\nWhatever is behind this very well planned abduction relied on the assumption\nthe world would make that the plane has crashed.They are 7 days ahead and\ntracks will be covered well by now but we can with luck and a lot of help find\nout where it landed.\nNot likely the actual aircraft was the reason\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026more likely the cargo, be it\nhuman or otherwise.\nScenario X87L9:\nThere are two hijackers. They have somehow smuggled a gun on board. Or are\nusing the old \u201cfake bomb\u201d trick. No matter.\nAs the plane reaches cruising altitude, one of them walks up front, maybe\npretending to get some water or use the restroom. Maybe he DOES have a liquid\nbomb; it doesn\u2019t matter. He has waited for the flight attendant to open the\ncockpit door. He pounces, gets into the cockpit, then says the usual hijackery\nthings and whatever he says freaks the pilots out enough to do what he says to\ndo.\nHe is now joined by hijacker #2. They are both semi-knowledgeable about\naircraft systems \u2014 perhaps have small aircraft training.\nThey tell the pilots that they want to fly to, say, Mecca. It doesn\u2019t really\nmatter. First, they order the pilots to turn off the transponder. Then,\nHijacker #1 stays with the pilot while Hijacker#2 goes off with F/O to go turn\noff other devices.\nMeanwhile, Pilot is forced to make the turn, being watched carefully by\nHijacker #1. He programs in waypoints heading for wherever it is that the\nhijacker wants to go. Surreptitiously, he somehow begins a slow climb, heading\nfor past the ceiling of the 777. I\u2019m not sure if he can somehow depressurize\nthe plane by himself but his plan is to incapacitate everyone on board, don an\noxygen mask and then retake control. At first, Hijacker #1 doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s\ngoing on \u2014 Hijacker#2 is still with F/O turning things off. He doesn\u2019t have to\nknow what things to turn off \u2014 he can just say \u201cI know all about these planes,\nso you\u2019d better turn everything off that can let the ground know where we are.\nOr I\u2019ll set off the bomb. F/O, not wanting to take any risks, does at he is\ntold.\nRapid decompression suddenly occurs but Hijacker #1 twigs to what the pilot is\ndoing and sits in F/O\u2019s seat and avails himself of the F/O\u2019s oxygen mask.\nFrom then on, my story becomes murky. But all the people in the back are out,\nmaybe permanently. Hijacker #1 now tries to make sure pilot is taking them\nwhere he wants to go \u2014 or, perhaps both are incapacitated by the\ndecompression, so now we have a plane programmed with a few waypoints \u2014 maybe\neven a destination \u2014 but with no one now at the controls, or perhaps one of\nthe hijackers at the controls, the plane starts descending, ascending,\nwhatever.\nBut it keeps flying until it ultimately runs out of gas and crashes in unknown\nwilderness.\nI know there are enough holes in this theory you could drive battalions\nthrough \u2014 it\u2019s much more likely that one of the pilots \u2014 probably the younger\nF/O \u2014 takes control of the plane and incapacitates the pilot, or, co-opts him\nin turning off all the relevant devices, then incapacitates him and perhaps\nthe rest of the jet using the depressurization method, then finds himself\nalone at the controls perhaps with a landing strip in mind. Conversely, his\nintention all along has been to crash the plane; he just does not want any\nevidence to point to him for whatever reason.\nMaybe he gets smashed on little liquor bottles and passes out. Plane crashes.\nThey seem to know that the plane actually went through certain waypoints \u2014 but\nI never heard precisely HOW they knew this. And if they knew that, why didn\u2019t\nthey know the approximate position of the plane when it finally went\ncompletely dark?\nSure, my story is quite a tall tale. But I am willing to bet that one of the\npilots was the perpetrator, for sure. There is no mystery about how one person\ncould have been down below the cockpit shutting things down \u2014 the perpetrator\ncould just have incapacitated the other pilot, or forced the other pilot to\naccompany him around the plane turning things off.\nSomehow, they are going to find out by hook or by crook if any of the\npassengers had evan a remote knowledge of flying \u2014 you can\u2019t hide months of\nflight school from your friends and family. And a 777 pilot has made it quite\nclear that if you WEREN\u2019T CHECKED OUT ON A 777 \u2014 say, you were checked out on\nan Airbus A320 \u2014 you would not have had the knowledge to go through the\ntriple\u2019s systems and know what to turn off or how to do it. Thus, this points\nagain at one of the pilots. And I\u2019m willing to bet it wasn\u2019t the elder one.\nIf you accept the facts that they have put on the table \u2014 that a human being\nmust have done the things that were done after that last \u201cGood night,\u201d then\nyou MUST accept that it was either one of the pilots or someone who HAD\nTRAINING ON A 777.\nThis requires no scenario-inventing; it is simply an INCONVERTIBLE FACT based\non what all the various entities have insisted happened. In the end, what\nhappened to the plane does not really matter \u2014 safe to say it is not sitting\non the runway at some remote jungle air strip \u2014 what matters is finding out\nwho the perpetrator was. And only an atom-by-atom take-apart of every person\non that plane is going to yield the answer of who the person was who did this.\nPlanes do not program themselves, turn off specific instruments in order to\nthwart being found, or continue flying for indeterminate amounts of time.\nThere should be no \u201cmystery\u201d about WHAT happened \u2014 the mystery should be in\nWHO did it and WHY they did it. And finding that out should possibly be the\neasiest thing of all to do, lacking the plane or any wreckage from it. You can\ntake my mythical story and spin it 100 other ways, but the fact remains that\nthis is a Whodunnit and not a Whereisit.\nAt least, by deductive reasoning, that\u2019s the only possible thing left to\nexplain this mystery-that-shouldn\u2019t-be-a-mystery.\nApologies for the double posting.\nPretty compelling evidence for a hijack, and probably an inside job. I\u2019d look\nfirst at the cabin crew, with the rest of the team, including someone with\npilot training, among the passengers. Weapon(s) smuggled aboard or stashed by\nmaintenance or baggage handler. Most probable target some city in India.\nCabin crew hijacker uses status to gain access to flight deck, the rest of the\ntragic and bloody scenario best left to the imagination. Purely guesswork, but\nif true, the remaining question is: why didn\u2019t they complete their mission?\nPretty compelling evidence of a hijack, and probably an inside job. I\u2019d look\nto a member of the cabin crew rather than the pilots, with the rest of the\nteam (including someone with pilot training) among the passengers. Weapon(s)\nsmuggled aboard by crew member or stashed in advance by maintenance or baggage\nhandler. Most plausible target some city in India.\nCabin crew member uses status to gain access to flight deck, the rest of the\ntragic and bloody scenario can be left to your imagination. If all this\nguesswork is true, then the question is: why didn\u2019t they complete their\nmission?\nPut this in your pipe and smoke it\u2026\u2026\u2026.you steal a plane, fly it to a pre-\nselected destination, say, Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean\n(home of the US military with a runway long enough to take off and land a 777\nand within the 5 hour flying range), kill the passengers, load a nuke, and fly\nit to where every you want, and detonate. Instant false flag\u2026..blame whomever\nyou want\u2026.and makes for a very scary scenario.\n[\u2026] (See Smith\u2019s fuller explanation of transponders, radar, cabin\ndecompression, and other aspects of airline flying here.) [\u2026]\nIs it theoretically possible to manually turn off or disconnect the ACARS?\nYes, though based on other sources I have read (which sometimes are\nconflicting) even when off the system checks sat connection on a regular basis\n(the pings). This is probably done so when the system is turned back on there\nisn\u2019t a lot of handshaking required to start sending and receiving actual\ndata.\nAlso, unlike some reports, the pings do not include location information. This\nwould explain the two disparate course they are now searching. My guess it\nthat they are reconstructing the path by communication transit time (converted\nto distance) to the satellite and other factors. Geometrically this could\ngenerate multiple paths in opposite directions.\nHere is something I found on the pilot Zaharie Shah\u2019s facebook january 2013\nPolitics of fear..

Iran itself is now\ntheoretically within range.\nWhat was the flight time to Beijing? Isn\u2019t it standard practice to add a\ncouple more hours worth of fuel in case of circling or diversions?\nIran? Really? IRAN? Gosh. You better stop watching Fox News.\nI think it will still take some weeks before they find it. They don\u2019t really\nknow where is the aircraft and the surface where they have to look is so huge\nand still increasing everydays\u2026 RIP.\nIt is very worrying that public and media attention are (intentionally?)\ndiverted away from the plausible theory of decompression and damaged antennas\nscenario towards the more sensational (\u2018terror\u2019, \u2018lost\u2019) speculations that\nease off pressure from Boeing to be more forthcoming about potential problems\nwith the 777. Can anyone out there attract the attention of serious reporters?\nNot that easy to try to land, discretly, such a plane.  \nWhere can we find a small, but long enough (1,5km as it is the minimum landing\ndistance of the 777 200er), airport in this area ?  \nSome small island with an aiport\u2026  \nImpossible ?  \nLook at Great coco island\u2026..\nIs it possible to swap transponders?\nCould it be that the real MH370 transponders were on some other, smaller plane\n\u2013 a red herring to lead investigators astray?\nThe small plane probably rode alongside MH370 for a while then separated into\na zig-zag course, with its transponders giving off signals that everybody\nassumes were from MH370?\nSo everybody runs off looking in the Indian Ocean, but the real MH370 probably\nflew stealth mode, just above the drink, to a secret location to be used later\nfor a nefarious mission?\nIn that case, search missions should be looking in the opposite direction from\nthe Indian Ocean, near countries with poor or patchy radar, inefficient\nmilitary or air force, probably within a 1000 miles of the coast of Malaysia.\nI have not heard or seen anything that can\u2019t be explained without invoking\npirates, (calling Peter Pan) but it seems that nearly everyone is just leaping\nwith joy at that explanation.\nPat, am I way off here?\nIf something happened to depressurize, and it interfered with flight crew O2\nthey had about 10 seconds of useful consciousness or so. Hard to tell what\npeople losing the ability to think correctly might do. Their actions pitch the\nplane to 40000 feet or so, where nearly everyone on the plane is put to sleep\nby the lack of O2 already, except for a small number, perhaps, that manage to\nget some O2. They try to fly the plane, and perhaps they are fighting some\ncontrol that is still engaged, but have no radio or other way to communicate.\nSince the plane was turned around it flies back across the islands where they\ntry to land or do something, but they wind up flying out to sea, and crash.\nA damaged, broken, perhaps had a fire, plane with nearly everyone or everyone\ndead flying until it runs out of fuel.\nI just don\u2019t see any evidence of pirates yet, without starting to make things\nup.\nUnless one thinks there is a pirate out there who thinks they are going to\nscare people by disappearing airliners like David Copperfield. As far as\nstealing one, I can\u2019t imagine why they wouldn\u2019t just lease one for a month, or\nknock off a cargo carrier.\nThese big ones have controls, people with guns, safety doors, all sort of\nthings that make it hard, and there are so many other easier way s to get a\nplane like that.\nCould be, but it seems like a leap.\nMalaysia PM mentioned Turkey as a possible destination and I paste below some\nrelated notes that I have been collecting:\n1\\.

Recently a Turkish cleric has called on jihad against Chinese:  \nhttp://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2014/03/04/uighur-muslim-jihadi-we-are-\ncoming-o-buddhists-killing-you-slaughtering-you-and-cutting-off-your-heads/\nBut doesnt make sense, with so many other Muslims on board, how could they all\nbe sacrificed. Unless the plane landed and they were removed, and the rest of\nthem to be \u2026 on video tape, as has been done before. I am really hoping this\nis not the case, but it seems like Rupert Murdoch has been pushing this idea\nall along:  \nhttp://news.oneindia.in/feature/missing-mh370-to-bin-laden-rupert-murdoch-\nfinds-a-link-1412633.html  \nand  \nhttp://inagist.com/all/444652513476632576/\nhttp://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=0041c1b9-d938-4956-a88e-436c8fc8ba45&k=33368\nPost 911 planes can be controlled from outside and are uninterruptible\u2026\nanyone can verify this?\nAfter all the comments you\u2019ve posted here (and who knows where else?), you\ndidn\u2019t even realize such a simple and basic fact?\nPlease step away from the keyboard for a while, I\u2019m trying to get to the end\nof the comments and don\u2019t need to have to skip over nonsense to get there.\nThank you.\nWhat the devil? My comment was NOT for the general audience here, but was most\ncertainly a reply to Fiona.\nIssues with ReCaptcha re-directed my comment to top level somehow.\nHere\u2019s what I replied to:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n> Fiona, please remember that Viet Nam airspace  \n> is where MH370 was headed, NOT Chinese.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \n>> oh. didn\u2019t even realize. thanks  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nInteresting reading.\nHaven\u2019t read all the comments, but Patrick, I have a question:\nFirst of all, could some sort of disastrous event \u2014 but not \u201csmashing the\nplane immediately into smithereens\u201d disastrous \u2014 cause the transponder to\nfail, then 14 minutes later, the data transmitter (is that the same as\n\u201cACARS\u201d?) -I mean, a severe structural failure, perhaps involving rips in the\nplane\u2026 Couldn\u2019t that kill one instrument, and only finally destroy another one\n14 minutes later? (Via further structural rips, perhaps impacts of objects/\nstructure within the cockpit\u2026 or a fire that somehow survives briefly but does\nnot consume the plane [how does fire fare in oxygen-deprived environment,\nanyway? if depressurization is involved?)\n-2nd question: If pilots/crew are incapacitated by hypoxia or other events, CAN the autopilot \u2014 whether swiftly programmed by a not-fully-incapacitated pilot, or, whatever \u2014 fly a course that includes going through those \u201cnavigational waypoints\u201d? Or does that kind of flying imply an ABSOLUTE requirement that a person is at the controls?\nCould a confluence of events have come together to create this?\nThank you for your thoughts. -B\nHave they discovered anything about either of those pilots which might point\ntowards them being potentially suicidal?\nAnd if it wasn\u2019t a pilot but someone else who managed to take control of the\nplane, well it\u2019s a hell of a scenario to have someone on board who was not\nonly capable of taking control of the plane but also knew what to do to direct\nthe plane in a particular manner and effect the controls to hinder detection,\nand at the same time be suicidal.\nThat is similar to my question\u2013pilot suicide has been mentioned as a\npossibility since the beginning, so why haven\u2019t we heard anything from people\nwho knew the pilots (or the crew)? I\u2019ve heard some personal stories about some\nof the passengers, but not about the pilots.\nI am not on-board with the pilot suicide scenario. But in a related note, I am\ncurious why the officials have not declared who actually said the final words\n\u201calright, good night\u201d. Was it the Captain, First Officer, or neither?\nSpeculation has been FO due to common practice, but I have not seen that\nofficially confirmed.\nMalaysian Air has to have someone who can ID the voice print. Or Flight\nControl. Or even voice recognition software. Why has no one definitively said\nwho done it? Give us that much, at least!\nWhatever answer they give, it would reduce, by half, the theories and\nspeculation out there.\nto borrow from the old \u201cthe butler did it\u201d \u2014 who better than the crew to both\ngain access to the cockpit and subdue passengers\nif anybody BUT the crew did it \u2014 why didn\u2019t the crew individually attempt to\nmessage for help as they would be first to know something was wrong/\nThe main question is , was there anything worth stealing? Aircraft routinely\ntransport currency and gold and other high valued items. If someone knew this,\nand would not hesitate to kill over 200 people (hence..no phone calls or\nmsgs). then consider the following the sequence of events \u2026..(1) whoever is in\ncharge of the cockpit turns off the transponder (2) initiates a turn back\ntoward Malaysia (3) dons his oxygen mask and starts to depressurize the\naircraft .(4) the passenger masks deploy and he tells the passengers there is\nan emergency and to put on their masks (5) the aircraft is still at altitude\nso after 12 minutes the passengers all pass out and die (the plane flew\nanother 30-45 min after turniing\u2026passenger oxygen is only good for 12-15min0\n..(6) the pilot dumps some fuel to leave oil slick and misinformation (7) When\nclose enough to landing field, drops below high altitude radar (8) lands at\nnight somewhere where associates are waiting and has provided enough\nlighting.(9) cover the plane with tarps so it will not be seen easily from the\nair\u2026(10) off load your loot\u2026\u20266days head start\u2026..cnn, beauracracy and political\negos extend their time\nI understand that some of the communication equipment could have been shut\noff. Is it possible to shut off, or avoid communication with the black box?  \nThank you for all the information you have provided here to help me (us)\nunderstand the workings inside a plane!!\nThere has been a wave of sensational speculation regarding this MH370 flight\nfrom last week. But my thoughts concern the very nature of this flight.\nFirstly we know that it was a check flight for the FO on the 777. In that\ncontext, is it not conceivable that the Captain would have assigned a variety\nof theoretical diversions to simulate weather or engine failures, all while\ntracking to Beijing? I am a pilot and every check flight I have had involves\nuntold torturous exercises, all theoretical. But to that point, if they would\nhave practiced them, then surely the FO would have been required to enter\nthese into the FMS? That could start to explain the track change, following\nthe NAV Waypoints. Now consider the 12 year old 777. An FD has recently been\nreleased regarding possible slow decompression due to corrosion of a panel\nnear the comms area. Given the context of such a busy cockpit, is it not\nreasonable to assume the pilots may have missed the alert for cabin pressure,\nsupported by the possible mumbling on the radio shortly before loss? As far as\nthe Transponder is concerned, this sits just below the left hand of the FO.\nNow we know Hypoxia can make people do funny stuff, so is it also now possible\nto imagine that the FO in his confused state disabled the Transponder to\npossibly encode 7700 but passed out before turning it back to transmit? If you\naccept the premies here, then the plane would have then flown onto IGARI\nwaypoint, turned to follow the FMS flight plan amendment to Alor Star,\nfollowing what ever Flight Level was entered in for that \u2018theoretical\u2019 track\nand then continued well on into the Indian Ocean. If you now accept all of\nthis, given the flight time, the plane would have come down between Diego\nGarcia and Male in the Maldives.\nPlease let me know your thoughts?\nMy thoughts are, \u201cThank you for some thought-provoking words!\u201d\nThis thread has been getting sadly more incoherent and you\u2019re a breath of\nfresh air.\nCheers\nMy hypothesis: I think this is actually what most likely happened. And to add\nto your description-I think that while the plane was ascending to an elevation\nsuitable for cruise control, there was a gradual decompression issue that set\nin especially during the 3 or so minutes after the pilots left Malaysian\nairspace and as they entered Vietnam else airspace. At this time the Japanese\nwere trying to communicate with the pilot who is mumbling due to lack of air.\nPerhaps they heard the Japanese telling them that their plane was not\ncommunicating. Perhaps the pilot was trying to reset or fix the transponder\nand passed out while it was in off mode. Also the plane was heading in a 40\ndegree turn around this juncture to make the NE turn towards Beijing. I think\nthe plane kept turning given lack of pilot control. I also think that the\nplane was gaining altitude while turning \u2013 which pilots often do\nintentionally. The plane just kept turning until pointing toward the Indian\nOcean and eventually stabilized it\u2019s own trajectory and kept flying until it\nran out of gas. It did not land smoothly, but most likely spilun sideways\ncrashing into the Indian Ocean I am guessing they will find something from\nthat plane this weekend or very soon. I believe the search is on the right\ntrack.\nThis seems quite a plausible scenario to me. The question is can you\ndemonstrate any human interaction in the long period after the\ndepressurisation or crisis event? It surprises me that the hijacking theme is\npursued without first eliminating the possibility of the plane flying itself\naccording to some earlier programmed simulation that wasn\u2019t revoked.  \nOr what would happen if the pilots disengaged from the old course, began to\nturn and then passed out. Would the autopilot somehow plot its own new course?\nI wish we could view the media appearances, I won\u2019t even watch the mainstream\nstuff because it\u2019s too sensationalized. Patrick would be the voice of reason\nI\u2019d be interested in hearing.\nCan\u2019t wait for your next update Patrick. Thanks for providing a little\ncommunity for the MH370 obsessed.\nEr, scratch that earlier message of mine, about appearing on the show \u201cInside\nEdition.\u201d\nFor the second time I wasted a chunk of my day sitting down for a taping by\nthat show, only for them to NOT use the segment.\nBack in October I spent half a day at Kennedy Airport doing a taping about my\nbook with them. It was supposed to air that day, and they DIDN\u2019T USE IT.\nNow it happened again. This morning I got up early after an extremely hectic\nday yesterday, with another extremely hectic day on tap for today, because\nthey promised, this time, to run the segment and to mention the book.\nWell, once again they DIDN\u2019T.\nYou have no idea how angry this makes me. I was exhausted this morning but I\nwent and did it. And it was a very good interview \u2014 probably the best I\u2019d done\nall week.\nCNN\u2019s Erin Burnett show also canceled on me, last minute, after I was already\nin the studio, on Wednesday afternoon, saying they were \u201cgoing in a different\ndirection\u201d\nAw, that\u2019s too bad! Do they compensate you for this time? They should!\nEspecially if it doesn\u2019t go on air. Maybe you could stipulate that next time?\nI\u2019m sorry you wasted your time, we are listening here. To every word.\nPatrick, I would have thought you would have learned by now that you exist to\nserve their story and should be thankful for the opportunity \ud83d\ude42\nI have only done a little bit of media here and there but only dealing with\nthe legal system is more likely to help you lose faith in humanity than doing\ntelevision interviews.\nIf Iran can build underground cities for nuclear weapons programs, they would\nprobably have the ability to build a runway fairly quickly. The biggest time\nfactor is in the concrete curing.\nWhere would they build it? How about one of the Andaman islands wiped clean by\nthe tsunami. Some of them are big enough and remote enough to go undetected.\nWork by night, cover with camouflage by day so planes don\u2019t spot. Worked for\nthe Allies building up for D-Day.\nThe Malaysian pilots provided the skills, the Iranians with the stolen\npassports provided the where.\nCan you provide the \u201cwhy?\u201d\nYou really need to ask? Or do you believe Iran really loves everybody and is\njust misunderstood?\nThey\u2019re certainly not just a couple of kids taking a car for a joyride.\nI mean what would the point of taking a 777 be? Iran is on the edge of getting\nout from under crippling sanctions so if it comes out it was them, it will end\nup costing them way more than anything they could hope to gain from this.\nIf you are thinking they would want to secretly \u201cweaponize\u201d the plane, they\nalready have a 747 cargo plane that would work much better for such a purpose.\nwish I could pour over that passenger/crew list.\nyes I\u2019d treat it like a game of clue w/ 238 Ms. Peacocks and Professor Plums\nfiona says:  \n> wish I could pour over that passenger/crew list.\nYou can. It\u2019s at the following URL:\nhttp://www.malaysiaairlines.com/content/dam/mas/master/en/pdf/Malaysia%20Airlines%20Flight%20MH%20370%20Passenger%20Manifest_Nationality.pdf\nI looked at it at first out of curiosity, but while reading it found that\nseeing all those names and nationalities make me really see that \u201c239\u201d number\nas individual people, all flying for one reason or another.\nthank you!!!\njust learned that somebody who went to one of my schools was on board \ud83d\ude41\nlots of scientists/ engineers on that plane.\ncool! anybody have link to the show? I wanna see who\u2019s blog i\u2019m posting on!!\nThe Piers Morgan thing didn\u2019t go very well. He totally blocked me from the\nfirst segment (not a word), and hardly let me talk during the second one, then\nstarted spouting on about crying Chinese grandmothers and \u201cWHEN WILL GET AN\nANSWER!\u201d Then it was over.\nI actually _wore a tie_ for that abuse.\nI was on with Wolf Blitzer, and Richard Quest\u2019s CNN-I show earlier in the\nweek, plus CNN-I again on Friday. They went more smoothly. I also did two NPR\nspots, \u201cInside Edition,\u201d CBC-TV, Bloomberg TV, Al Jazeera, and a bunch of\nother stuff. See HERE for the full list.\n\ud83d\ude41 my sympathies. screw em \ud83d\ude42\nPerhaps next time Piers asks your panel a question, you could put your\nunderwear on your head, stick two pencils up your nose, and simply respond\n\u201cwibble wibble\u201d.\nAt the very least, if would grab his attention\u2026\n\u2026and by establishing a cultural connection, you might win a friend.\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/episodes/four/four_goodbyee.shtml\nI think the suicide theory is extremely unlikely, and what an inconvenient way\nto do it and why take everyone with you? Can\u2019t imagine this being the case. As\nfor the pilot with the home simulator\u2013if he was up to no good, I think he\nwould have destroyed the evidence prior to trip and certainly wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen photographed smiling in front of it.\nIt is bizarre that this has not been thoroughly investigated however and makes\nme think the investigators are not doing a very good job at all.\nRichard Quest is good. Hes actually one of the few (if not the only) regular\nhosts on CNN who seem to know what hes talking about in this case. And he got\nthe balls to tell them off when they are just plain wrong.\nI agree; Richard is very good.\nPatrick\u2026 saw you on CNN with professional troll Piers Morgan. I was hoping for\na sober discussion but it was evident that Piers wanted to troll right from\nthe beginning. I solute you for trying your best to resist his trolling\nattempts. The other two panel guests were foolish to engage Piers Morgan by\nanswering his trollish leading questions.\nBut I guess this means you won\u2019t be back on CNN for a while\u2026\nFor benefit of other people reading \u2013 Patrick was on Piers Morgan Live on\nMarch 13 as an \u201caviation expert and airline pilot\u201d, and did his best to try to\nstick to the facts.\nIt does appear both routes indicate an intention to avoid land based radar.\nThe odds are increasingly against an mechanical/electrical emergency.\nSo what is it then, a suicide mission? What\u2019s the point of taking control of a\nplane and flying it until it runs out of fuel and falls into the ocean. Even\nif someone were using the plane for a suicide mission, why go to all this\ntrouble; just crash the plane and get it over with.\nI still say that many are primarily focusing on the most diabolical scenarios\nand not putting much thought into more simply unfortunate scenarios.\nRead my reply to Radaan above. Suicidal people are often not rational. Or\nperhaps are rational on their own terms which are confusing to us who are not\nsuicidal.\nNot that I am convinced it was suicide \u2013 but it is plausible (more so if the\nsouthern course turns out to be the correct one).\nHave they discovered anything about either of those pilots which would point\nto one of them potentially being suicidal?\nAnd if it were someone else who took control of the plane, that would be one\nhell of a scenario\u2026 Not only to have the capacity to take control of the plane\nbut also to know what to do to redirect it and also to effect the controls so\nas to hinder its detection, and then also to be suicidal.\nI think if you are considering a suicide scenario it would likely have to be\none of the pilots. I have not heard any reports of emotional difficulties or\nlife stress. But if it was more of a \u201cstatement\u201d suicide, it would have been\nplanned in secret with few signs.\nOne of my wife\u2019s coworkers took his life last year and left an extensive\nwebsite detailing his fight with depression and his suicide planning including\nprevious attempts. He was an engineer and the level of detail was amazing \u2013 it\nincluded graphs, photos of sites, and frankly brilliant writing. Reading it\nwas one of the most startling experiences I have ever had \u2013 weeping through\nthe loss of this amazingly thoughtful person but at the same time coming to\nunderstand his apparently valid reasons for his course of action. His father\ntook it down soon after it was discovered (IMO doing so was a loss but it was\ndefinitely his decision). Anyway, none of his coworkers had any clue\nwhatsoever.\nRichard, I have some data which doesn\u2019t support your suicide theory very well\u2026\nhttp://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/suicide/by-country/\nMalaysia is tied for the 3rd lowest suicide rate in the entire world.\n0.6/100,000 people. Compared to Canada (9.9) and the US (10.3) for example.\nWell, I think there are more problems with the suicide theory than that. It\nwould be one thing to assume that one of the pilots could disable the other\npilot and without bringing much attention to the mostly sleeping passengers\nchange course. But the rest of the crew is surely awake and would, I would\nimagine fairly quickly figure out something is wrong. At this point the whole\ncrew and passengers would be trying to get into the cockpit.\nOf course, now that I think about it. if the other pilot was in fact dead,\nthere might not be anyone left on board that could do anything significant\nabout flying the plane or even getting the communication system back on (he\ncould have in fact, damaged the system beyond use).\nI was thinking that it would be very difficult for single person to take over\nthe plane for but maybe it is possible.\nWas supposed to be a reply to Pelegrin \ud83d\ude41\nThis commenting system can be wonky.\nHmmm, following this idea further, the situation described about would really\nput the crew/passengers in a quandary.\nIf the pilot is suicidal, no amount of threats are going to work on him.\nIf the pilot isn\u2019t suicidal but rather is hijacking the plane, the\ncrew/passengers have to make a decision: if they think they are going to die\nanyway, they might, like UA93, attack to prevent the plane being used to kill\nothers. But unlike UA93, they have no communication to the outside world that\nwould confirm this. Attacking him and actually killing him would most likely\nresult in their deaths, not doing so might allow them to live. The pilot still\nholds most of the cards even if he wants to survive because the\ncrew/passengers retaking the plane gains them nothing under the circumstances.\nOf course this situation is prefaced on the fact that the pilot could confirm\nthat there was no on else on the flight capable of flying the plane.\nAnother thing is this though; if it\u2019s principally a case of a pilot trying to\nfly a suicide mission (which I\u2019m certain it is not), then two things for sure\nthat he would have have done in this case are: 1) incapacitate the other\npilot, 2) incapacitate pretty much everyone else on board to at least stop\nthem from using whatever communication source they had to communicate with the\nground to tell someone that something bad is going on in the plane.\nCertainly there were people with their mobiles, laptops, or whatever, that\ncould\u2019ve sent some sort of message; if they were able to do so. The only thing\nis that at that time of night most would\u2019ve been sleeping, but not all, and\neventually people are going to wake up and realize that something isn\u2019t right,\nat least members of the crew.\nBut no kind of message was ever received, as far as we know, and the only\nexplanation I can think of for that is they were already dead.\nOf course, if the pilot with the suicide mission could incapacitate the other\npilot and was also able to turn off the oxygen supply to the rest of the\nplane, then he has total control. So there, Richard, if that would be possible\nfor a pilot to do (though it seems to be a hell of a lot of control to be\npotentially in a pilot\u2019s hands) then your suicide theory has some greater\nplausibility. I still though just don\u2019t think it fits either of these pilots;\nwe\u2019ve not heard anything about either of them to suggest this; and again, as I\npointed out earlier, suicide is extremely rare within the Malaysian\npopulation.\n(apologies if this is a repeat post\u2013formatting issues)  \nI think the suicide theory is extremely unlikely. What an inconvenient way to\ndo it and why take everyone with you? Can\u2019t imagine this being the case. As\nfor the pilot with the home simulator\u2013if he was up to no good, I think he\nwould have destroyed the evidence prior to trip and certainly wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen photographed smiling in front of it.\nIt is bizarre that this has not been thoroughly investigated however and makes\nme think the investigators are not doing a very good job at all.\nNew development-criminal investigation:  \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-\nflight.html?_r=0\nWOW! That\u2019s big time info. Not so much the investigation, but that map showing\nthe possible locations of the plane at the time of the last \u201cping\u201d detected by\nthe satellite.\nJust, Wow!\nWell, can\u2019t we pretty much rule out the northern route? A 777 evading radar\nfor that long pretty much seems impossible.\nIt does seem unlikely the pilots could depressurize the plane in flight but\nmaybe Patrick could weigh in on that. But again, I proposed it might be\npossible to psychologically incapacitate the crew and passengers if no one\nelse can fly the plane. And if he got out of cell range ASAP, the window for\npassenger and crew to get out calls may have passed without anyone yet knowing\nthe hijack.\nAnd to be clear, I think the hijack option is mostly (90%) confirmed (I\u2019ll\ngive another 10% to some very unlikely series of mechanical weirdness). But I\nthink the reasons for the hijack remain unclear and could still include\nsuicide. But not that suicide is a better choice than hijacking for other\nreasons.\n\u201cit might be possible to psychologically incapacitate the crew and passengers\nif no one else can fly the plane\u201d\nThis is the dark point, when I try to make all the facts together : why did\nnobody make a phone call when the plane crossed over Malaysia mainland ?\n* Either there was a terrorist team of several persons, who had practical means to terrorise the crew and passengers \u2013 and even in this scenario, it is not obvious to control more than 200 people. This seems unlikely : a quick browse through the passenger list would have been sufficient to the Chinese or Malay police to understand what had happened in a very short time ;\n* Either there was one lone wolf, either one of the pilots or some rogue passenger who had obtained access to the cockpit, who had locked himself in the cockpit. But if this had happened, at least the crew and probably everybody would have understood very quickly that there was a big, big problem.\nSo,\n* either everybody -except perhaps the pilot- was knocked out or even dead from the very beginning of the highjacking, probably through depressurisation ;  \n* either there was no phone signal while the plane was flying over Malaysia and/or Sumatra.\nAm I right ? If I am, what is the explanation ?\nLet\u2019s see if replying to someone else works. See comment 322-323.\nAnd I just realized something else. Even if the jammers were on when the plane\nwas still on the ground, doubtful anyone would have been too concerned, other\nthan the normal frustration, of not being able to get a signal. Otherwise,\npeople would have their devices off from around push-back to when the pilot\nsays it is okay to turn them back on (I assume the captain does in fact tell\nthe crew to give the announcement and that they don\u2019t do it automatically when\nthe plane gets to cruise). Even so, they are supposed to be in airplane mode.\nSo as long the jammers were on by the time the passengers tried to make\nconnections, they were effectively cut-off and would likely not even thought\nto consider there might be a little box tucked under the seat below them\nkeeping them from making calls.\nIf you want your comment to appear at the bottom of this thread, I believe you\nneed to \u201creply\u201d to the last comment, otherwise comments seem to be getting\nlost upthread.\nMy question is if the flight data is to be believed, by raising the plane\naltitude to 44000ft, and then dropping to 27000ft, would this cause\npressurisation of the cabin effectively cutting oxygen to the passengers. The\npilot has his own oxygen supply so carries on his merry way with no threat of\npassenger interference.  \nAs to a suicide, was he a disgruntled employee that wanted to cost and\nhumiliate the malaysian airliner by travelling as far and remotely as possible\nbefore crashing the plane?  \nSurely someone with a flight simulator would have simulated many difficult\nlandings on roads, beaches,etc, even on remote airstrips? Just to add in\nanother theory. We are 7 days behind the 8 ball, enough time to hide a plane.\nBut if it was one of the pilots what now for him if he is alive? The pilot had\na family and grown children?\nWhy was there no resistance or alarm on the part of the passengers or non-\ncockpit crew? A scary possibility is that the inexplicable ascent to 45,000\nfeet was done to kill the passengers and cabin crew. If the plane\ndepressurizes at that altitude the o2 from the bags isn\u2019t enough. The plane is\npressurized by air forced in to the cabin from the engines, and can be\ndepressurized by shutting the engines off. The steep dive after reaching 45k\nmay reflect a stall, which depressurized the cabin. During the glide down to\n27k everyone perishes except the pilot(s) and then the engines were restarted.\nThough awful, this is not as awful as being worried about one\u2019s life and loved\none for 5 hours then plunging into the sea, if indeed that is what happened.\nThe long flight to suicide in the deep waters of the Indian Ocean may have\nbeen designed to prevent anyone from ever finding the plane and determining\nwhat actually occurred. This could be motivated by the pilot\u2019s desire to not\nvoid life insurance policies that have a clause for no payouts for suicide.\nAlso, an indeterminate end of the flight would leave open the possibility of\nhis family getting legal settlements.\nTrying this again since I think my \u201creply\u201d got lost upthread \u2026\nI have a question regarding those \u201cpings\u201d that the satellite(s) \u201cpick up\u201d. At\nwhat point or under what conditions would the satellite(s) no longer pick up\npings?\nWhat about aircraft that are not in the air? Sitting at the gate, idle. Or\nperhaps in a hangar in for repairs, maintenance, etc. Are those aircraft still\nsending \u201cpings\u201d ??\nAn expert was interviewed who state that the pings would continue to be sent\nas long as the plane had not been powered down. The pings would be picked up\nuntil the plan crashed, lost power, or traveled to a point at which the\ncurvature of the earth would put the earth between the plane and the\nsatellite.\nIt\u2019ll take a lot to convince me that one or both of the pilots were in on\nthis, unless it was a case of someone threatening to kill their families.\nOh, and the posting problems that some of us have been having\u2026 I\u2019ve been\nclicking on the bottom reply button, but many of my posts have gone up to\naround post 318, thereabouts.\nactually, many of my posts from yesterday went up to around post 312\nSo who else on the plane has that much planning and expertise to recognise the\npoint just before the plane left malaysian airspace and Infact was in no mans\nland,? Who else on the plane has knowledge of the very clever navigational\nroute taken to avoid suspicion?\nI\u2019m looking for purpose, as one thing. I don\u2019t believe at all that it was a\nsuicide mission. And if that\u2019s not the case, but yet the pilots or a pilot was\ninvolved then I\u2019d be more prone to think that he was coerced into it by some\nsort of death threat to his family. Not saying that that\u2019s what I believe that\nhappened, it\u2019s just the only way that I imagine the pilots being involved.\nBut again\u2026 For what purpose?\nAnother possibility is that it could\u2019ve been a failed take over attempt in\nwhich the pilots were able to prevent some greater disaster but ultimately\ndied in the process.\n2nd try. Got upthreaded in my upthreaded comment! copy and pasted\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed a lot of interesting replies here due to the upthreading\nphenomenon. Just spent the last hour searching for \u201cMarch 16\u2033 and reading\nreplies posted on the 16th scattered about. Quite an interesting bit about the\nPetronas Towers.\u201d\ntrying to repost this as no clue where the first post ended up at\u2026 thanks~~\nIs it not standard procedure for an airline pilot to sign off with the word\n\u201cRoger\u201d instead of the now famous words, \u201cAll Right, Good Night\u201d, Perhaps the\nwording I am looking for is that should he/them not said\u2026 Roger, Good Night?\ncheck out reply #348 by Nicholas Robinson, March 16, 2014 at 11:38 pm\nThe way these replies keep getting \u201cupthreaded\u201d is nuts.\nFor me this might not be an attention seeking plot but it certainly reeks of a\nbit of smugness. It\u2019s so perfectly planned, flying between radars, disabling\ncommunications, my theory is the cabin was depressurised which killed the\npassengers, the plane for over 7 days now has been undetected, I can see the\npilot very proud of his sophisticated knowledge. The world is following his\nmastermind, the maylasian and indeed other world governments and military have\nbeen outsmarted. Maybe that is reason enough. Posted again I think due to up\nthreading\nI am going to throw out here a stupid honest opinion about this 370 mess from\nthe highness of my armchair experience into plotting a terror strategy for my\nbackyard terrorist organization.\nWe all love tropical conspiracy theories, so here\u2019s mine.\n1\\. Everybody talking about the elder pilot, because of more hours experience,\nbecause of the simulator in his house. If I was to train my very next terror-\nemployee, I would raise up a young kid from the start, with no rush, teaching\nhim all the good jihadist basics and giving him all the time (7-10 years) to\nget a flying license, train and slowly get into the commercial flying world,\nup to the point of arriving where the younger 370 pilot was.  \nIn that way, he would just look like a rookie but he would still know his shit\nand could possibly fly this thing in order to be undetected. He would also be\nfaster and more agile in case of a hand-fight in the cabin at the moment he\nhad to take control of the flight against the elder pilot\u2019s will.\n2\\. I would develop a plan with my cookie-terror organization to be ready to\ncamouflage the 777 on some remote landing strip the very moment the airplane\nlands. I would make sure that the young pilot kid takes care of the passengers\nby either depressurizing the shit out of them while up-there or just simply\nignoring them and locking himself up in the cabin. Even if the try to stop him\nby opening a damn door, he would still just need to bring the airplane down to\n-what?- 11,000 feet or something like that to be able to still control the\nbird.\n3\\. The airplane lands in our cracked and abandoned landing strip somewhere in\nPakistan or Afghanistan. We camouflage it or hide it in some hangar. We get\nrid of the passengers by either imprisoning them or worse (no need to say). By\nimprisoning them I would still be able to have an asset for blackmailing\ngovernments and buy to my terror organization a good ransom to build up the\nnext plan in case this goes wrong.\n4\\. I would fill up the 777 with high-power explosives, paint something\ndifferent on the outside just to make it hard to be identified, place a nice\nDurka Durka Kamikaze boy to the command, and instruct him to crash the plane\nsomewhere against a high sensitivity target such as for example the Burj\nKhalifa in Dubai, not too far from where I am and the icon of the capitalized\nworld (tallest building in the world).\n5\\. I would tell my banzai boy to take off at night and with all that\nexplosive fly towards UAE and blow the building at the base. It would make\nsomething like a mile-diameter damage and collapse the building.\n6\\. I would then let the world know it was my terror organization and I would\nhide for the rest of my life waiting for the next navy seal team to find me\nand take me for free food for life to Guantanamo Bay.\ncould the plance have flown into the stratosphere and burnt up?\nI agree with Frank\u2019s points above, especially #1.\nNot sure if this has been mentioned previously, but an informant had indicated\n(before flight 370) a plot involving Malaysian terrorists was in the plans:\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/03/16/malaysia_airlines_mh370_investigators_examine_9_11_style_plot.html\nA question about radar detection: Do all countries keep reliable records of\ntheir radar monitoring? So for instance, if someone was asleep at the wheel,\nwould they even be able to go back and view the radar from days ago?\nPakistan states they have no information on the plane and that their radar did\nnot detect it. Didn\u2019t they also assure us their country was not harboring Bin\nLaden?\nSome theories that I have:\nWhat if someone on board really was experimenting with cloaking technology and\nit worked? Satellites might still be able to pick up those \u201cpings\u201d but that\ndata is generally reported after the fact and doesn\u2019t provide precise\ntracking, as we can see from the information we\u2019re being shown now. But some\ntype of cloaking technology, if it\u2019s possible, might work to block all radar,\nand then perhaps the northern route becomes more feasible.\nOf course, another option could be that the Chinese actually shot the plane\ndown as it was flying over their territory and not responding to\ncommunication, before they realized what it was, and then they decided to\ncover it up and not admit that they shot down a passenger jet with a whole lot\nof Chinese citizens on board.\nBut, other than those options, the northern route seems very unlikely. On the\nother hand, the southern route only makes sense to me if the plane essentially\nflew itself there, probably after an attempted turn back to KL which failed\nbecause all on board fell unconscious or died before the pilots were able to\nget the plane fully turned around and back to KL. I just simply don\u2019t believe\nin the suicide angle, as there\u2019s no evidence to support it and Malaysia has\nthe 5th lowest suicide rate in the entire world. And there\u2019s no \u201cterrorist\u201d\nangle that makes any sense flying the plane into the southern Indian Ocean.\nAnd yet another possibility for what happened, other than a cascading event of\nelectronic malfunctions which effected tracking and oxygen supply, could be a\nfailed attempt to try to take over control of the plane remotely; so rather\nthan successfully flying the plane through radar infested territory it\nactually incapacitated everyone on board and resulted in the plane flying to a\nwatery burial in the Indian Ocean.\nPelegrin \u2013 I replied but it ended up at 366.\nOkay,\nAnother maybe-not-so-loopy one from The Grand Prognosticator (I can\u2019t believe\nsomeone took my link to a major hoax site seriously \u2014 in which the hoaxer\ninsisted the US Navey had kidnaped the plane and forced it to land at Diego\nGarcia, and it was tied into the strange drug deaths of the Navy SEALS aboard\nthat freighter . . . Heavens, man, can\u2019t you tell a joke when you see one? But\nI digress.)\nWhat if you were the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, and a few days before a\ngirfriend had spurned you. I don\u2019t know. Why does anyone commit suicide? I\u2019m\nnot going to ask WHY, I\u2019m just going to assume that this was the case.\nAb Hamid, despondent but hiding it well, gets on Flight 370. He already has a\nplan. He doesn\u2019t have the guts to blow his brains out (can\u2019t get a gun,\neither) but knows ONE WAY he can do it \u2014 and it\u2019s a comfy way, a way he\u2019s\nintimately familiar with. He\u2019ll kill himself in his beloved cockpit.\nSo, perhaps even on the way to the airport that day, he hatches a plan. Or\nperhaps he\u2019s hatched this plan and mentally rehearsed it recently on several\nflights.\nHe knows his schedule. He knows the captain well \u2014 he\u2019s a good guy and won\u2019t\nmake any trouble when the time comes. All Hamid needs is a little time.\nThey get up in the air. Hamid, thinking furiously, finally makes the decision\nto do it. But he doesn\u2019t have the guts to plunge the plane into a massive dive\n\u2014 he knows that would freak the passengers out and really, he\u2019s a good guy \u2014\nhe doesn\u2019t want them to suffer.\nBut he\u2019s made up his mind. So he puts his plan into action. Just at the\nupcoming border with Vietnam, he asks the captain to do something for him \u2014 we\ndon\u2019t know what \u2014 or leaves the cockpit himself. He knows the combination to\nlet himself back in.\nHe goes below and turns off the transponder and fetches a bottle of walkaround\noxygen that only the crew has access to. He comes back to the cockpit. The\ncaptain has noticed that the transponder has been turned off and confronts\nHamid. Hamid says something like \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! But maybe you should\ngo check it out!\u201d\nSo the captain leaves the cockpit to go check the transponder below.\nImmediately, Hamid pulls the throttles to zero. Instantly, the rear cabin\ndepressurizes. Hamid dons the oxygen walkaround and ignores the captain\nhammering at the cockpit door. He\u2019s somehow changed the conbination. After two\nor three minutes, when he\u2019s pretty sure the back of the plane is immobilised,\nhe gives the \u201cGood night\u201d announcement to ATC and then boots the engines and\nimmediately climbs the plane to 45,000 feet, making sure that all in the back\nare now dead.\nHe then brings the plane back down to 29,000 feet and repressurizes the cabin.\nHe goes back to the galley and maybe fetches himself a bottle of scotch and\ncomes back to the coskpit. The plane is silent.\nHe sets the course for some distant waypoint in the Indian Ocean and begins to\ndrink the scotch. After a couple of hours of drinking and crying, he finally\ndecides to pull the plug. He depressurizes the plane for the last time, and\nlapses into unconsciousness.\nThe plane dutifully flies the waypoints he programmed, way over the Indian\nOcean, for hours longer. At around 8:30 a.m. it begins to run out of fuel \u2014\nfirst one engine goes, then another, and he\u2019s losing altitude more and more\nrapidly. He\u2019s almost at sea level when the final engine coughs its last and\nthe plane hits the water at 470 knots, breaks up, and quickly sinks, thousands\nof miles from the nearest land. It is 6 more days until anyone realises he may\nhave taken the plane that way. By that time, the wreckage \u2014 such as there is \u2014\nis so scattered that there is little left to find.\nHamid has committed his lonely suicide and now no one will ever know what\nhappened to him and the plane.\nWhat do you think?\nYeah, good novel. And it qualifies perfectly as one of the 10,000 or so\npossible scenarios.\nI hope he\u2019s got some warm woollies on because that plane is going to be awful\ncold. But then of course he has the scotch to keep him feeling warm.\n@Nicholas Robinson \u2013 if I\u2019m not mistaken, I was the lone replier to your Diego\nGarcia spiel. and yeah. I knew it was a hoax. lol.  \nand creative scenario (#418) but I am afraid we may never know the truth \u2026\nUp at post 370\u2026. Can\u2019t this threading problem be fixed? Seems to be a pretty\ngood little group of us posting here, but yet we have to deal with trying to\nfollow each other\u2019s posts and where they are.\nreplying to you \u2013 just to try to help me post get placed at the end.\nI think when the c-pilot said alright goodnight he was attempting to call for\nhelp by code \u2014 he was saying HELP \u2014 because if he had wanted to go undetected\nhe would have said the formal sign off that was expected. which he knew full\nwell. Somebody was literally or otherwise holding a gun to his head \u2013 somebody\nnot the other pilot who would also know the correct sign off. So he couldn\u2019t\nsay \u201chelp\u201d he had to hope that by saying something that sounded right but was\ntechnically wrong \u2013 would sound alarms.\nI believe it was somebody who didn\u2019t know the correct sign off who was holding\nthem under duress, somebody who knew how to fly \u2014 but not somebody who knew\nthe correct sign offs.\n(repost from 374; Not sure why it posted way up there)\nI need help understanding something:\n1 \u2013 the ACARS system, even disabled, still pings the satellite about every\nhour\n2 \u2013 we have maps of where the LAST ping was, in long arcs over Asia and the\nIndian ocean\n3 \u2013 what about the previous pings? Wouldn\u2019t those previous pings, in sequence,\ngive us a better notion of the flight path, either north or south, given the\nlast Malaysian radar contact?\nWhat am I missing?\n\u2014-  \nOn a separate note, can someone please loan me a large round red rubber nose\nto send to Malaysia\u2019s Transport Minister for him to use during \u201cPress\nConferences\u201d?\n(reposting via a reply) The NYT has just reported that the change of flight\npath was programmed in the cockpit. (That would be 9:30 PM eastern time,\n3/17). \u2013Significant? Or an obvious assertion?\nSome questions that I don\u2019t see the media asking:\nWhy didn\u2019t the Emergency Locator Transmitters ELTs go off upon contact with\nthe water? Is this normal is airplane crashes? Can they be disabled by a\npilot?\nCan a pilot depressurize a cabin and kill everyone? Some sources say yes,\nothers say no.\nWhy hasn\u2019t Inmarsat released the other \u201carcs\u201d so that we could see the plane\u2019s\nprogression over 7 hours?\nCould any weather satellites see the plane\u2019s contrails, or any spy satellite\nsee the heat signature at night?\nHave any of the passenger\u2019s cellphones connected to any cell tower in any\ncountry after the transponder was turned off?\nWill Boeing remove the capability of turning off ACARS from their software?\nThe emergency locators are likely pinging right now. They are ultrasonic so\nwhile sonar in the area will work, simply flying over will not. Also, the FDRs\nmay fail at a depth greater than 6000m; there are quite a few areas to the\nsouth of Malaysia where this would be the case.\nNot sure on next three questions\nMaybe but doubt they\u2019d tell us that\nAs I have noted, I think it would be big news if any calls connected but so\nfar nothing. Given the inaccuracy of the flight path, there may be a lot of\ndata to check. I did previously note that one could buy two or three cell\njammers for $200-500 that would prevent passengers/crew from connecting with\nany towers even if they were close enough.\nThe issue is that pilots need isolate electrical systems in case of electrical\nfire. As electrical fire/shorting is more common than terrorism, I imagine\npilots will retain the option of shutting down systems.\nI guess Malaysian authorities now say they cannot be sure the transponder and\nACARS were turned off at different times.\nhttp://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/03/17/mh370_malaysian_airline_ceo_backtracks_on_sequence_of_final_communications.html\nho-humm\u2026 post went up to #378\nWho\u2019s going to worked on the mystery of the possibly hijacked commenting\nsystem? \ud83d\ude42\nUmm (Here\u2019s hoping this ends up at the bottom of the heap!)\nJust to give you an idea of the caliber of the personnel of the Asian nations\nwho juts *might* have a vested interest in finding out what happened to MH370,\nand their Inspector Clouseau-like attitude to the whole thing, we have this\ndelightful article from the Bangkok Post: http://tinyurl.com/nog9oaz\nI mean, THESE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROFESSIONALS. Yet they held on to\npotentially crucial data for -wait for it \u2014 ten days. And their explanation?\n\u201cWith only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that\nFlight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change\nits search strategy.\n\u201cWhen asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said,\n\u2018Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only\nlooks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look\nlike a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.'\u201d\nHow nice to know that the Thais are ON THE JOB! No more worries now!\nThere is no formal sign-off. Having listened to quite a bit of ATC chatter,\n\u201cAll right, good night\u201d is completely normal.\nSee above reply to you but, no, \u201cAll right, Good night\u201d is a perfectly common\nacknowledgement leaving an ATC region.\nIf the reports of erratic climbs and dives are inaccurate, and it was the\nCaptain or First Officer that committed the act, then the passengers and cabin\ncrew might not have realized that there was anything wrong, at least\ninitially. This was a red eye flight with a portion over water, with a long\nprojected flight time and no moonlight. If pilot #1 incapacitated pilot #2 and\nhid that fact, there *might* not have been anything obviously amiss in the\npassenger cabin for a while.\nI most emphatically agree with the \u201calready dead\u201d scenario. However, we need\nto ask a couple of questions; do the oxygen masks deploy automatically upon\nsensing a lack of oxygen? How are they deployed?\nFurthermore, I disagree with the \u201cdead in 4-5 seconds\u201d comment. I\u2019m no\nrespiratory therapist, but I would bet the even with the meager amount of O2\nat 45,000 get, a human being would be able to remain conscious for at least\nthirty seconds. Please correct me if you know the physiology around hypoxia.\nAt any rate, I highly doubt that any passenger \u2014 even if they had a single\nclue as to what was going on \u2014 would leap into action with their cell phones \u2014\nand, referring to an earlier comment of mine, the passengers were mainly\nmainland Chinese \u2014 a group, I will bet, who are not exactly in the \u201cAct now,\nfigure out later\u201d category.\nFinally, it is HIGHLY unlikely that any cellphone at 45,000 feet would be able\nto reach another cellphone in the same aircraft, let alone the ground.\nIn my mind, there would have been zero possibility for anyone, including the\ncabin crew, to reach the ground in the time frames postulated. Besides, taking\ncare of business ON the plane would have been their first instinct, not trying\nto tech the ground. Perhaps after ten minutes of contemplation, but definitely\nnot in the dozens of seconds that were probably available to them.\nAs I point out above, the reason could be to fly the plane to a location where\nit is unlikely that incriminating onboard evidence could be recovered. Among\nother things, if it was a pilot, the lack of evidence would make the loss more\nacceptable to his surviving family (think of suicidal individuals that crash\ntheir cars so that it looks like an accident). It would be especially\nplausible if the aircraft is shown to have turned toward the Southeast after\npassing Sumatra.\nJust look at the worldwide fixation. Is that not proof enough it worked?\nThere are several explanations for going to such lengths to conceal a suicidal\nhijacking, but the simplest is this: terrorists are always cooking up new\nschemes to scare people. If this plane was brought down by a terrorist (with\nall the disclaimers about speculations, etc.), this could be a new tactic even\nmore effective, perhaps, in the post-9/11 world where we thought we\u2019d seen it\nall.\nRichard the aircraft did not fly off from the Straits of Malacca following any\nAirways path. For a start these airways routes are above 29,000ft for aircraft\nstrictly following ATC proceedures and this aircraft was wandering about the\nsky below these altitudes. One phrase sums up that issue \u201cRed Herrings.\u201d\nWow, even with the pings, they have two candidate areas that are in different\ndirections.\nI am beginning to feel like a witch. Have had a gut feeling that this was a\nplanned abduction and the captain is in on it and now we have that scenario\nconfirmed.\nJust seen the press release with the Malaysian PM.AND AT LAST the crew will be\ninvestigated\u2026\u2026\u2026 look at the captains 777 simulator!\nAn abduction to do what? Fly the plane, with the Captain included, into the\nIndian Ocean?\nSee above at 309\nI think the erratic flying means we can rule out suicide or plot by pilot.\nunless the two pilots were struggling with each other.\neither way erratic flying = conflict within cockpit. IMO\nPiracy? Or pilot suicide. Someone who didn\u2019t want the plane, with its\nincriminating CVR and FDR intact, to be recovered. Hence a diversion to the\nloneliest part of the Indian Ocean. To the cabin crew and passengers, nothing\nmight have appeared to be wrong (assuming they were still conscious at this\npoint, viz. speculation about the climb to FL4500).\nOne question, though, is there a plausible way that the flight crew could\nintentionally depressurize a 777 at altitude? It\u2019s not like you can blow a\nhatch on the passenger cabin or something.\nis 45,000 feet crazy high? i have no idea what is reasonable height.\nsometimes if data is too unbelieveable you assume it\u2019s false\u2026 dunno if that\napplies here.\nNot crazy high but according to the Boeing website, maximum cruise is 43100.\nTo clear the mountains to the north you would need more height.\nCNN now reporting that US and Maylaysian officials believe the plane made\nerratic elevation changes (up to as high as 45,000 ft), and may have\nultimately crashed in Bay of Bengal or Indian Ocean. Am watching on CNN tv,\nand also breaking on their web site.\npirates just sliped to top of theory list.\ndid you guys know Jet Li\u2019s stunt double was on board? can you imagine trying\nto take over a plane and an acton star stunt double is rt there \u2014 makes me\nthink of the massive undertaking of controlling all those passengers period. I\nthink it would be crazy hard\nLike I said earlier, doubtful that there was any violence if the flight went\non smoothly through the night as if it was on way to Bejing.\nOn landing\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026now that would be a bit of a shock but I guess everyone would\ndo as they were told\u2026.I know I would.\nPeople have been obsessing over the disappearance of Amelia Earhart\u2019s tiny and\n(by our standards) primitively equipped plane for over 75 years. They can\u2019t\nseem to believe that those 2 people just \u201cvanished\u201d. So I guess it\u2019s\nunderstandable that losing hundreds of people on one of the most modern\naircraft available would capture so much attention.\nthis is random but true \u2014 my relative was last person to track Amelia Airhart,\nhe was pilot that flew behind her. i spent vacation with him when i was a kid\nbut was too young to grill him ;(. weird I just remembered. anyway, he was\nsuper nice I miss him \ud83d\ude42\nguessing it must do otherwise it would be the main source of tracking during\nflight.\nalso \u2014 given the chance they are on rafts out in the water somewhere or on\nland needing help. & that the black box will sise battery power after 30 days.\nthank god we are obsessed!! if it were me on that plane i\u2019d want the world\nobsessed until they found me.\ncan someone tell me if the black box only gives out signals after a crash?\nYvonne \u2013 from what I understand, there is a beacon on the black box that is\nactivated once the black box has been submerged and pings once every 30\nseconds. That is the only \u201csignal\u201d of which I am aware from a black box.\nFiona, I admit I\u2019m embarrassed to be so obsessed with this flight. I\u2019ve never\nbeen one to be so enraptured by mysteries, but I think it\u2019s my hope and\noptimism spurring me on. If the plane landed intact, then the passengers\n*could* be alive. If they\u2019re alive, they can be saved. Obviously, if the plane\ncrashed or was overtaken by an extremist group with violent means, well\u2026 That\nwould be utterly heartbreaking. Not knowing\u2026 This is why I\u2019m obsessed.\nI think\na) it\u2019s human nature  \nb) It IS solvable. There are so many clues.Possabilities can be eliminated.\nSomethng can be figured out.  \nc) we are trained by TV, movies and eve video games to \u2014 be obsessed with a\ncertain kind of dramatic unfolding, & the way this info has been leaking out\nand then being retracted and then leaked out again \u2014 this IS the way to keep\nthe mind obsessed, it\u2019s even the way drugs work \u2013 highs and lows \u2014 getting\nsomething then having it denied \u2013 creates addiction. I think the pattern of\ndenial is playing a strong component here.\nd)WHATEVER \u2014 we should want to solve it.

On the other hand, if they made it to their \u2018friendly\u2019\nairspace, then they would no longer need to cloak their presence and they\ncould turn their transponders back on\njust read the latest post on this blog \u2013 above. i was kinda forgetting I was\nactually posting on an personal bloggers perspective. I like this blog!\nI think it\u2019s interesting the idea of when and when \u2013 not \u2014 this keeps people\u2019s\nrapt attention. esp cause understand and mastering dramatic suspense is\nessential to my life and work. here in movie land.\npersonally I think the human interest is there \u2014 nomatter how sentational or\ndetective-y this gets. the underlying feeling is there are 238 humans \u2014 lost.\nI\u2019m 100% sure people would NOT CARE if this was a cargo plane under exact same\ncircumstances,\nit\u2019s so dark and sad \u2014 that we naturally want to turn it into an adventure,\ndetetcive story \u2013 to carry us through \u2014 to save these people \u2014 and our own\nsense of human safety. and to save our sanity. one can argue that it\u2019s\ndisrespectful to be more engrossed by the utter mystery \u2014 than other times and\nthey may have a good argument \u2014 bt I\u2019d argue counter that this is a survival\nmechanism for humanity \u2014 to want to solve mystery. this all makes me think of\nthe recent new cosmos show \u2014 collective psychology about the unknown is\nsomething humans have been struggling with \u2014 seems since we started having\nconversations.\nI\u2019m rambling, \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m enjoying anonymity.\ni hope we sold this mystery down to last detail.\nSOLVE\nI can\u2019t believe the developments, or lack thereof, regarding Flight 370. For\nit to disappear, then to find out it was running for five hours, and yet no\nreal clue to where it went\u2026 It\u2019s confounding. I am hoping the passengers will\nbe found safe, but what are the chances? I pray for some peaceful resolution\nto this quandary.\nI pray that somehow the passengers will someday be found safe. AND\u2026does anyone\nelse see a \u2018made for TV movie\u2019 in about 1-2 years\u2026whether they find something\nor not?\nYes.  \nThat show will be called Lost.  \nThey\u2019ll make it into a series that plays all season. Even several seasons.\nin my opinion it was not a hijack at least not in the sense that they had to\nbe on board, although they probably were. My gut feeling is that this was\nthoroughly planned and the captain was being blackmailed to cooperate\u2026.. JUST\nA FEELING THOUGH and a lot of wishful thinking for the safety of everyone on\nboard.\nunfortunately\u2026if it was hijacked\u2026and landed somewhere else\u2026and the US knows\nit\u2026being a cynic at heart\u2026I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be told that.\nAgree with you on SOMEONE KNOWS ALOT MORE THAN IS BEING RELEASED\u2026. when the\nplane is found there will be some explaining to do but we will be fed the\nusual\u2026\u2026.Have to be honest though, am a bit fearful of my scenario.\njust read something from Forbes\u2026I think\u2026that said at some point part of the\nACARS info was turned off\u2026and possibly\u2026later\u2026when they stopped getting even\nless descriptive ACARS data\u2026that maybe\u2026they implied\u2026whoever was piloting\nrealized that they didn\u2019t totally disable ACARS\u2026who knows. Again\u2026there\u2019s so\nmuch info tossed out there\u2026some from people who know\u2026some/most from people who\nprobably don\u2019t. I have to think that the US probably knows exactly what went\non\u2026but can\u2019t say because it would reveal too much intelligence gathering\ncapabilities.\nyeh! Pings from aircraft for 5 hours\u2026\u2026\u2026.confirmed\nroyls royce doesn\u2019t seem to think it crashed., that\u2019s what most eggs me on.\nI think most likely it did crash in Indian Ocean, considering how far away\nland is from where it last pinged and it\u2019s fuel supply.\nhowever I think it is still slim-ly possible it flew to europe or middle east\ninstead.\nI dunnooooooo\nfrom what I have heard\u2026if its accurate\u2026those Islands would be the only land\nthey probably could have reached. But maybe I missed something\u2026\nYup you missed something\u2026\u2026\u2026..5 hours at 500 mph with enough fuel\u2026\nYvonne, I hope you are right\u2026but where would he have landed if it didn\u2019t\ncrash/run out of fuel. An official from the Andaman (sp?) Islands said there\u2019s\nno place there that a plane that size could have landed without notice. Where\nelse could it have gone?\nThe Indian Ocean is so big\u2026I\u2019ve heard officials say it could take weeks of\nsearching to see any wreckage\u2026if there is any.\nWhy assume Andaman and Nicobar islands? I have faith that if enough\nintelligence is gathered using the US capabilities that missing plane will be\nfound\u2026\nWho says no one has to notice? If it were a pre-planned diversion, the\nreceiving country would be expecting it to land.\nat every point where we lost contact \u2014 we assume that\u2019s where it crashed \u2014\nuntil new contact in revealed \u2013 and then we assume it crashed where at the\npoint where that contact ended. this is logical to assume these crash points.\n.\nbut given the pattern of revealed information \u2014 it\u2019s now also logical to\nassume it went further than last know contact.\nAre Fiona and I the only ones on this site to think it HAS NOT CRASHED?\nYvonne, I don\u2019t think it crashed, either. I really think there is something\nmuch more insidious to this.\nI\u2019m still waiting for someone to opine on why\u2026if the pilot did a suicide\nmission\u2026why wait the five hours until the fuel ran out? Why not just ditch the\nplane in the ocean as soon as they could?\nmaybe he loved flying. he wanted to spend his last five hours in open air over\nvast ocean. maybe that was his fantasy of how he wanted it,\nor maybe it was something entirely else.\nThere is no reason to suspect it was pilot suicide. The facts are that the\nplane disappeared at a very opportune moment, turned and dropped below radar\nlevel and headed SW\u2026IF the military radar proves it was the 777!!\nUntil that and the bleeps are confirmed nothing is definite.\nHowever, my feeling is that in finding no wreckage AT ALL ( and something\nalways floats to the surface if the ditch was in water\u2026.shallow waters too in\noriginal area of last contact) then the whole thing has been planned and\nanother few days with the best investigators should see an end to this\nmystery.\nI will opine on the suicide thing as a psychologist (though not a clinician).\nPeople do weird sh*t.\nOk more seriously, while some people just want to die to to make the physical\nand/emotional pain go away, some want to make statement or leave a lasting\nimpression (for various reasons). The difference between jumping off a cliff\nin the wilderness vs. off an overpass onto a crowded freeway. More extremely,\nyou have people like Adam Lanza etc. Thus it may have been the intent of a\nsuicidal person in control of the airplane to create a lasting legacy about\nthis event and him/herself. Making sure the plane is never found would\ncertainly do it. Hell, many people to this day still think of Amelia Earhart\nwhen we think of airplane disappearances and that happened over 75 years ago.\nfiona says: \u201cSeems to me they neither landed or crashed according to pings.\njust flew in air till engines stopped going.\u201d\n\u2026unil the engines stopped going\u2026AKA: crashed\nyay ladies\nI think they were intentionally following flight routes \u2014 not just flying\nblind. so they were awake and wanted no communication. . who \u2013 or why \u2014\u2014\u2014- ?\nAnd how it worked out\u2026\nWe are on the same page here Fiona\u2026\u2026.. female intuition at work?\nWant to see some investigation on the captains simulator\u2026\u2026 keep looking for\nwreckage but please think it has landed somewhere.\nA night flight lasting as long as the expected flight to bejing would not\nalert any of the passengers or cabin crew to a misroute\u2026\u2026. until they landed.\nis it possible that some type of gas-based toxin  \nwas released in the cabin that overcame passengers and crew  \nnearly instantaneously??? \u2026leisurely stroll up to the  \nflt deck door, pop the latch, switch off the comms, and away you go\u2026\nSeems to me they neither landed or crashed according to pings. just flew in\nair till engines stopped going.\nThere\u2019s a plausible sounding posting over on Slashdot that says this\nparticular data transmission system attempts to handshake with the satellite\nevery hour even when the airline has not signed up for the service. This makes\nsense. That way, if the airline does sign up, Boeing can activate the service\nwith a single upload to the sat and not require that somebody go out and\nfiddle with every aircraft in the fleet. If the post is true, the both sides\nin the \u201cit was transmitting/it wasn\u2019t transmitting\u201d dispute were right. It\nwasn\u2019t transmitting *data* but it was periodically transmitting *protocol\nsignals.* Which presumably were picked up and stored in some SIGINT database\nsomewhere and later retrieved.\nWhich brings up another point. This effort has, and probably will continue to\nhave, recourse to some pretty sensitive technical intelligence systems. I\nwouldn\u2019t expect partial results to be released because they may expose the\ncapabilities of those systems; I don\u2019t think much will be said until if and\nwhen the aircraft is located.\nThey apparently have already rule out a catastrophic event because the\ntracking systems were turned off 14 minutes apart\u2026which would strongly seem to\nindicate someone was controlling the situation.\nI\u2019ve been following this thread for several days now but have refrained from\nmaking any comments as I am not in the airline industry \u2026 however this morning\nI noticed this report. Any thoughts? Seems to not be getting much attention by\nmedia so far. However, in my humble opinion, a catastrophic event, in my mind,\nseems most likely to have occurred and my thoughts and prayers go out to the\nfamilies of the passengers and crew of MH370.\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/missing-jet/seismic-event-close-missing-jet-\npath-china-scientists-n52516\nHope someone is checking the captain\u2019s 777 simulator which he had in his home,\napparently.\nMust have a record of his activity on it.\nWas he practising an unusual landing in an unusual location?\nThorough background checks on him and his family goes without saying.\nOk\u2026here goes. I haven\u2019t read everything since I went to bed last night\u2026when I\ngot up this morning I hear more of the theory tha the plane was purposely\ndiverted because the tracking systems were both turned off within 14 minutes\nof each other. And the plane seems to have diverted right between the handoff\nof ATC\u2019s from Malaysia to Vietnam. If he it was a terrorist hijack\u2026headed back\nout into the Indian Ocean\u2026they didn\u2019t have enough fuel to get back to any land\n(that we know of). If it was pilot suicide\u2026the pings from the enjines said it\nflew another 4-5 hours\u2026if it was suicide\u2026why would the guy wait 4-5 hours to\ndo it?\nBecause he didn\u2019t want it to be known that it was a suicide. I suspect he had\nan insurance policy that excluded coverage for suicide.\nBy taking the plane far out into the deep ocean, and by turning off the\ncommunications systems, he minimized the chances that the plane would be\nfound, and that anyone would ever figure out what happened. No proof of\nsuicide might mean that his family would get the payout of the insurance\npolicy.\nBy allowing the plane to run out of gas, the cockpit voice recorder, which\nonly has a 2-hour loop as I understand it, would not contain any talk from the\ncritical early part of the flight when he hijacked the plane, and likely\nkicked the other pilot out of the cockpit. I suspect that he actually turned\noff the breaker to this and the flight data recorders.\nPatrick,\nI was glad to read the piece by entrepreneur and fellow pilot Martin\nVarsavsky, and I wonder if you agree with him:  \nhttp://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/aviation-is-stuck-in-the-60s-a-\nreflection-on-mh-370.html\nContrary to many expert sources, he argues that real-time tracking of flight\nlocation and data would not be too expensive \u2014 and his take on pilots having\nless access to modern weather data than a passenger with an iPad almost\nworries me (think AF447 storm).\n[\u2026] ha anche un blog, e ha naturalmente affrontato il tema del volo MH370.\nSulla localizzazione [\u2026]\nI think the aircraft slowly depressurized. So Slow no alarms went off. The\ncrew and Pax passed out at FL36 thousand feet. (Hypoxia) The transponder, that\nsquawks the aircrafts ident is routinely, changed in-flite at certain\nwaypoints. Perhaps as the Pilots were passing out they or one of them may have\ninadvertently switched the IFF frequency instead of his ATC radio. They all\ndied from lack of oxygen and the aircraft flew on auto pilot till it ran out\nof fuel and crashed into the sea. Just like Greek Helios Airlines, Payne\nStewarts Learjet. It has happened before. Sometimes the simplest answer is the\nright one.\nThe alarms will sound whether the the depressurization is slow or fast. In\nfact, if it were slow they would be dealing with alarms and have a lot more\ntime to get the masks in place. Also, the masks drop automatically in the\npassenger compartment at a below critical threshold (obviously a rapid\ndepressurization hits and passes that safety threshold much sooner). Helios is\nnotable because the pilots willfully ignored alarms and other evidence for\nquite some time. This terrible error was probably due to common problems with\nthe aircraft ventilation system; the pilots simply assumed it was the return\nof a far less serious issue. But their behavior was cavalier in any case. Note\nalso, in Helios, they were in contact with the company to try to fix the\nsituation. One would imagine (hope) the pilots would call in for engineering\nsupport for a problem they couldn\u2019t immediately identify.\nI take it back. i wanna wash out my mouth for even saying it, i don\u2019t think\nit\u2019s the same paul weeks that works for boeing.\nwoah \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to say paul weeks name before cause i felt bad casting\nsuspicion. but I\u2019m glad you said it. the fact that he worked on those very\nplanes. i don\u2019 know what to think but it keeps me thinking. i\u2019d like to see\nmore investigation into this\u2026 these passengers who also knew he plane\nwoah you are rt there! I\u2019m on other side of planet.\nThe transponder stopped working at 1:30 am. (is this correct as different\ntimes quoted in various sources!) About this time a plane en route to Japan\nmade contact with the Malaysian flight and heard mumbling in response to\nrequest to contact Vietnamese airspace authorities. Are the two connected? Did\nsomeone turn off transponder (and more) deliberately to avoid further\ncommunication of any kind.\nOK, I\u2019m pretty sure this is nothing, but I haven\u2019t seen it in many places and\nmore eyes couldn\u2019t hurt:\nThe man who gave his wedding ring to his wife before the flight, his name is\nPaul Weeks. A google search turns up a Paul Weeks\u2019 Linkdin profile. This Paul\nWeeks works for Boeing as a mechanical engineer on 777s. Specifically \u201cProduct\nReview Engineer II \u2013 777 Wing & Final Body Join Integration at Boeing\u201d. MH370\nhad a wing repair two years ago.\nAnother man on the flight is Robert Lawton. A search on the name turns up an\nobituary from last year for a Robert Lawton who works as a Joint Mechanic for\nBoeing, on 777s.\nIs this anything else but coincidence? Boeing is a big company. It could mean\nnothing.\nGiven the sparse information but the satellite data of pings of the ACARS\nsystem suggests this hypothesis: could this be this is another SwissAir Flight\n11 \u2013 a fire in the Main Equipment Center (MEC) underneath the cockpit? If\nthere\u2019s a fire a smoke detector illuminates the \u2018EQUIP COOLING OVRD\u2019 message\non the cockpit EICAS.\nsee diagram here: http://www.skybrary.aero/images/B772_MEC_FIRE.jpg\nIt\u2019s possible after seeing a message the crew began a turnback to Malaysia.\nBut if the fire continued it could knock out communications equipment, which\nwould explain the loss of comms, and blow out the crew oxygen bottle which\ncould cause rapid decompression and crew hypoxia if it went off through the\nfuselage and/or the fire could have damaged the fly-by-wire flight controls\nwhich could explain the continued flight.\nWhile just a hypothesis, unfortunately a 777 had a fire in this exact location\n\u2013 luckily for them on the ground in London Heathrow in Feb 2007. See the UK\nAAIB report:  \nhttp://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/S2-2007%20N786UA.pdf\nThe report said, \u201c\u2026Prior to this accident the aircraft manufacturer was\ninvolved in investigating 11 in-service reports of power panel overheat\nevents, three of which involved major damage to the panels. The affected\npanels were the P200 and P300, and the affected contactors were the RBTB,\nAuxiliary Power Breaker (APB)and the Primary External Power Contactor (PEPC).\nNow imagine if the fire occurred in the air at 35,000 feet.\nThis is what happened to the Greek airline, 2005, all over again. I\u2019m feeling\nfairly sure, most signs point to that, if we\u2019re not running around looking for\nterrorist, sabotage explanations. I suppose if you\u2019re going to die in a plane,\nit\u2019s the best way to go, die in your seats asleep and not even know what\u2019s\nhappening.\nI\u2019m a going to make few conjectures:\nIf the plane few for several hours after it \u201cdisappeared\u201d AND the radar\ncontact over the Malacca Strait was the plane then:\n1) The crew/passengers were incapacitated and it was effectively a ghost plane\nthat ran out of fuel in a fairly straight line. Well, according to what the\nauto-pilot would have done. Speaking of which, the wiki on Helios 522 stated\nthe autopilot put the plane into a holding pattern on its own when it got to\nits destination \u2013 that seems like a bad thing to do?!\n2) A pilot or someone else with some training intended to crash the plane in a\nremote location to not ever be found (for whatever reasons). Thus they cleared\ncivilization as soon as possible (the revised course). In this scenario, they\nmay not have gone on a straight line from the last known course and could be\nanywhere in a VERY large area of ocean. And if it was with the intention of\nnever being found, they might have taken the plane in at a harder angle (as\nopposed to a ditch attempt) to reduce surface debris.\n3) Whoever disappeared the plane did so with the intention of landing it.\nAgain the path taken might have minimized potential radar contacts. Plus, it\nseems like those countries that would have had the best opportunity to see the\naircraft prior to it being out over open ocean would have not been\nparticularly aggressive about investigating or tracking (Cf. China). Under\nthis scenario, one would have to expect a course that is mostly out at sea\nwith a sudden return to monitored airspace for the shortest time the pilot(s)\ncould manage.\nRegardless, the fuel load was certainly recorded at departure as part of the\ncross-check before pushing off so, unless there was a conspiracy with the\nground crew, the amount of fuel and effective range should be known to\nauthorities. Not that they will tell us or anything.\nIn any case, the telemetry that the US has will apparently be key.\n(I suppose there is sort of a very unlikely 2a option where someone intended\nto make a \u201cstatement\u201d crash that was supposed to be in civilization but\nsomehow, after several hours of good control of the plane, screwed up and\ncrashed well before the target. That\u2019s a very dark horse in my opinion.)\nI should add that there is a bit of an issue with option 3. While one could\nargue that the selection of a red-eye flight of several hours duration might\nseem like a great target for getting a plane, there is the issue of the\npassengers. A \u201cre-positioning\u201d flight with no passengers would be even better.\nAs would be \u201cstealing\u201d a large cargo plane (which often fly overnight). In\nfact, I don\u2019t think we would even be having this discussion if this was a\ncargo plane with 3-5 people aboard that had mysteriously disappeared.\n(Personally I feel like casualties from cargo transport don\u2019t get the public\nconcern they should).\nSome have suggested, under option 3, it is about the passengers or some subset\nof them. A little too James Bondian in my opinion. So many easier and more\nsubtle ways to kidnap and/or buy off people than going to all this trouble\nwhich would, by present experience, create far more attention on the event\nthan would be desired.\nOk if we go along with the theory of plane thief:  \nFor the clever person who disappeared the plane and safely landed it\nelsewhere, who has been one step ahead the whole time without any problem\n(except for the lapse of forgetting to turn off transponder before turning the\nplane), they would surely see to it that the black box be swiftly removed from\nthe landed plane and never to be seen again.\nIs it possible that the plane crashed into the water with very little breakup\nand sunk almost whole?\nThis would explain almost everything. Everyone drown quickly, hence completely\nno cellphone activity. No real debris field. The transponder could have\naccidentally turned off by the impact(maybe it was unexpected(pilots fell\nasleep). The engine communications thing could still have taken place\nunderwater.\nI\u2019m sure it would be easy to disprove this hypothesis with current\ninformation. E.g., If engines can run underwater and the engine communications\ndata says the engines were running then that would be sufficient.\nBasically, the point being is that I do not think having no debris field rules\nout a crash? I imagine it is possible for the plane not to break up very much\nin a certain circumstances(unlikely but possible). I could be wrong but look\nat flight 1549.\nJet engines (like all combustion engines) need air to operate (and lots of it\nin the case of jet engines). Plus the density of the water would soon tear the\nturbo fans apart.\nIn addition, though electrical transmitters do work under water if\nsufficiently sealed (like the \u201cblack boxes\u201d) the distance they can be picked\nup is reduced.\nCould he have intentionally and purposefully turned off the transponder (or\nwhatever radar locating system) in order to avoid being seen? People would be\nquick to think it was a nefarious behavior, but maybe he was doing it for the\nbenefit of the people, for example, they were shot at which damaged their\nequipment, and then they wanted to escape the line of fire. Or maybe there\nwere shots on board, or a bomb that blew a hole in the airplane (and knocked\nout their electronic equipment), and they had to lower the plane in order to\nget oxygen. If you look at the Flightradar24 video, you can see that in the\nmoments before disappearing the plane cuts right and left a couple times,\nwhich may indicate a struggle in the cockpit, or an on-board violent attack.\nMaybe it crashed into the Crocker mountain range heading back\nAs one of the pilots was fond of inviting good looking ladies to the\n\u201ccockpit\u201d, some female agent could have got in their and could have \u201cblown\u201d\nthe pilots, the pilots then lost their way\u2026flew (in bliss) until their fuel(or\ntheir stamina) ran out.  \nHows that for a theory?\nIs anyone using common sense here ? Judging from the last radar response and\ndirection of travel, wouldn\u2019t the logical place to take this aircraft, under\nthe radar so to speak, be Nias Island ? South southeast of SDN 0706077\nDasomuzoi ? Can I be the only person on this planet seeing this ?\none man on the flight going for a \u201cfly in fly out\u201d job left his wedding ring\nand watch at home and said if something should happen to him his first son to\nmarry should get ring and second son watch.\nis that something people normally do when they take trips??\nugh \u2013 -now that some profiles on pessengers are starting ot come out\nit\u2019sreally hard not to look for who looks suspicious. the iranian was taking a\nreally round about way to get to germany \u2014 as another example.\nugh. ugh.\nMy take, the plane for what ever reason turned hoping to make it back.  \nBut never made it over the Crocker mountain range, I belive the plane rests\nthere.\nUh . . . all I can say is that *I* personally have MH370 fatigue. Someone\nshould start getting their stuff together here. We\u2019re all going to stand\naround twiddling our thumbs waiting for the people who should be on this to be\non this?\nIf no further progress has occurred by the end of this weekend i predict that\nthe vast majority of press and public will have moved on to something else\nHow incredibly regrettable.\nI\u2019d like to personally thank PS very kindly for keeping on these updates to\nhis blog.

BTW\nI live and work in KL, so you can imagine the conspiracy theories that are\ngoing around here night and day.\nsoon five hours of location will be published \u2013 I hope.\nI think the plane could have kept going after those five hours. esp since no\npings record crash. likely it did.\nthere\u2019s got to be a reason why none of the passengers attempted to communicate\nhome.\nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304185104579437573396580350?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304185104579437573396580350.html\nMissing Flight Left Data Trail  \nJetliner \u201cPinged\u201d Satellites With Location, Altitude for Hours After\nDisappearance.\nHave to wonder if that story has been tweaked a bit by authorities. Seems\nstrange the plane had a here-to-for never mentioned capability to ping\nsatellites. More likely, the US has satellites with the technology to ping the\nplane \ud83d\ude42\nRegardless, hopefully the plane\u2019s potential location will become more clear\nshortly.\nKiwi ain\u2019t too far off from what I said.

(responding to J Douglas).  \nI keep thinking that the jet was purposely disappeared rather than crashed.\nWhenever I see the search arc separated in 2 parts, I cannot help but wonder\nwhy they have concluded that it would not be in the middle/central segment of\nthat arc?\nI know, I know, they mention the last ping was 5 hours later\u2013this datapoint\ndetermines that arc. But give us all the hourly ACARS datapoints! Perhaps they\nwent out 2 hours into the Indian Ocean and rounded back to Indonesia or\nMalaysia? Perhaps they landed close and kept the engines running for an\nadditional 4 hours? Either way, these are 2 ways that the engines would\nprovide pings suggesting that it could be 2000 miles away when it might be\nright in Malay\u2019s backyard under everyone\u2019s nose?\nThey keep saying that its unlikely to be in the northern countries thanks to\nthe various radar networks. But India admits that at least in the Andaman\nIslands, they use the radar on an as-needed basis\u2013so it may not always be\nmonitored or even turned on. Also, it is possible that India, China, or\nKrygystan, among others, may have been \u2018expecting\u2019 that jet. For that matter,\ndon\u2019t count out US at Diego Garcia in the south.\nToo many motives to speculate on, numerous intriguing angles and such, but I\nam in the crowd that suspects that it has been an intentional act rather than\nan accidental event.\nIf the plane was carrying 7.5 hours of fuel as previously stated then if the\naircraft did indeed fly west it would have to ditch in the Indian Ocean. Why\nwould a probable hijacker fly to his death without declaring to the world of\nhis reasons, unless the aircraft\u2019s fuel tanks were full to capacity on take\noff (is it possible for someone to clandestinely put extra fuel in, I don\u2019t\nknow) The planes range on full tanks is sixteen hours if reports are to be\nbelieved this could take it anywhere e.g. Somalia, Yemen, there plenty of\npossibilities.\nBut the question is would it possible to deceive military air defences. We\nalready know it fooled Malaysian radar, could it deceive Indian military\nradar? Which brings me to another question. If the aircraft disappeared from\ncivilian radar (due possibly to military radar detecting at lower altitudes,\nagain I don\u2019t know.) I seem to remember the Malaysian minister said \u201cThe\nmilitary did nothing because the radar indicated that it was a commercial\naircraft\u201d!!  \nHow did they know what it was if all communication was supposedly switched\noff! Red flags should have popping up everywhere.\nSo, if somehow they were able to fly below the scope of commercial radar but\nnot the scope of military radar, theoretically it could fly from the east to\nthe west to wherever it wanted to go.\nFar fetched I know but so is disappearing without trace.\nWe don\u2019t know if it fooled military radar, we only know what Malaysia tells\nus.\njust watched latest CNN clip. apparently malaysia now confirms series of\npings.\nwhat does not exist tho \u2014 is an impact ping.\nwhich I guess means ther was no point of impact.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nYes the plane is worth a lot but only about 1100 exist presently and each one\nis chock full individually serial numbered parts. I don\u2019t think anyone can\njust sneak a 777 back into service with a new paint job and a VIN taken from a\njunkyard. \ud83d\ude42\nThat was supposed to be a response to Gen.\nFrom my previous question about why a pilot even has the ability to turn off\nthe transponder, this was on CNN\u2019s website: \u201cThere could be several reasons.\nOne reason could be when airplanes get close to each other (perhaps they are\napproaching an airport). Air traffic controllers may then request pilots to\nturn the transponders off or to standby. Also, if the transponder is sending\nfaulty information, the pilot might want to turn it off. Planes are still\nvisible on primary radar until they get below the radar\u2019s coverage ability.\u201d\nI am not sure if this has been raised in the comments above, but I do wonder\nif the captain\u2019s sign-off quoted as \u201cAll right, good night\u201d is consistent with\nhis usual practice? If not, it could be suggestive of a flag at third party\ninvolvement on the flight deck.\nlove to see an ansdwer to that\nthey are now sayingit aws normal\nThanks for the update Patrick. Now there\u2019s a new one to talk about (US Air).\nWow\u2026 But these circumstances? Then again, maybe it crashed before it could\nreach its final destination. At this rate, anything is possible!\napparently US gov suspects same thing \u2014 that possibly somebody wanted the jet\nfor later use.\nI think Kiwi\u2019s conspiracy theory is a real possibility. I think a plane would\nbe worth a lot to a lot of people\u2026 I would not be surprised if we discover the\nplan really has been stolen and the passengers disposed of in a horrible way.\nI hate to go to the worst case scenario, but I can\u2019t imagine how so many\npeople could remain so hidden for so long.\nPersonally, I believe MH370 has crashed. There is A LOT of ocean out there and\na Boeing 777 is very small when compared to it. There have been other cases of\naircraft disappearing and it taking weeks before any wreakage has been found:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Air_Flight_574\nIt just occured to me there must have been some level of struggle \u2014 because\nthe two communication devices got turned off about 7 minutes apart. if the\npilot was in full controll mere seconds would have passed between them being\nturned off \u2014 if that. but if somebody was ordering him to do it \u2014 he may have\nstalled, gotten further threatened and than admitted \u2013 yes there\u2019s another one\n\u2013 ok \u2013 there it\u2019s off as well now.\nmaybe it was somalian pirates and this was all gonna be for ransom. but once\nthey realized the international military response \u2013they realized they were\nbetter off staying hidden.\nI think there may be a confusion with ACARS and what the US is reporting.\nAlso, I don\u2019t think ACARS necessarily delivers data on a set schedule rather\nis it more event driven. The items in ACARS are either errors or summary stats\nfrom distinct events. So for example, RR gets a packet about engine\nperformance during take-off then another at the transition to cruise. So the\nnext ACARS to RR, under normal circumstance might have been the transition\nfrom cruise to descend. Note also that the pilots can use ACARS to send data,\nmost notably weather events (and receive weather events). I think the pilots\ncan shut down this system if they so choose.\nI think what the US is claiming (and I just heard the White House is\nconfirming US officials do believe the plane might have flown much longer) is\nthat they have (somehow) intercepted raw data from the engines.\nSo you have a constant stream of data coming from the engines: rpms, temps,\nthrust settings, etc that\u2019s a huge amount of data. This gets summarized by\nACARS and sent at certain points but the data is being always generated as\nlong as the engines are on. So trying to interpret what the plane is doing\n(landing, descending, ascending, doing emergency maneuvers) may be hard to\ndiscern from the raw steam. Plus, I would guess, like all sat connections, the\nsignal probably drops out here and there creating gaps further complicating\ninterpretation. My guess is, they think they have many hours of recording\nafter the disappearance but are still trying to figure out what they can about\nthe plane\u2019s behavior.\nCould the circumstances somehow be explained by a sudden depressurization?\nEveryone, pilots and all knocked out before they could respond? Seems like a\nsuper longshot, with the apparent shutting down of communications systems.\nThen too where would auto pilot have taken it. Again, long shot but more\ncredible to me on the surface than today\u2019s hot guess, theft.\nI keep imagining whole plane flying in air for as long as it can with\neverybody on plane unconscious.\nhowever \u2014 14 minutes between turning off one communication device and then\nanother . in a loss of air \u2013 -i don\u2019t think you have that much of a tiime\nframe\nso then i don\u2019t know how that idea makes sense any more\nThere are many theories and much speculation, and I try not to comment on\nthem. But, here\u2019s my conspiracy theory using what little factual information\nhad been supplied by the media:\nI believe it is possible that MH 370 may have been stolen. For what purposes?\nTerrorism obviously springs to mind.\nIf you were the leader of a terrorist organisation and wanted to steal a large\ncommercial aircraft to re-enact a Sept 11 event how would you do it?\nFirst you would need a pilot or pilots. You could train your own pilots or\nconvert, bribe, coerce existing pilots to your cause. The second option is\nmuch more attractive especially if they are already working in an airline and\nhave security clearances etc.\nOkay, so now you have your pilot(s) behind the controls of Boeing 777 on a\n\u2018red-eye\u2019 flight. When is the best time to make your aircraft disappear?\nObviously as the aircraft passes between two control areas, where ATC of one\ncountry are expecting you to disappear off their screens and the ATC of the\nnext country are expecting you to appear (not that I believe it really works\nlike this). So the pilot(s) shut off the transponder, descend and change\ncourse knowing they will have about an hour before anybody starts really\npanicking and searching for them. However shutting down the ACARS and the\nengine trend monitoring system might prove to be a bit more difficult and with\nengine data being sent every few hours it could give the game away\u2026\nBut how do you deal with 200+ passengers? Easy. While, I\u2019m not familiar with\nthe 777-200, other Boeing aircraft (737 on the P7 C.B Panel if I remember\ncorrectly) have a circuit breaker located in the cockpit that deactivates the\nemergency passenger oxygen system. Pulling this C.B prevents the oxygen masks\nfrom automatically deploying once the cabin altitude exceeds approx 14,000ft.\nOnce the passenger oxygen system is deactivated, it is simply matter of\nmanually opening the outflow valve and dumping cabin pressure. Hypoxia will\nincapacitate everyone in the cabin, while the pilots breath oxygen through\ntheir masks which are supplied from a different source. (This scenario could\nexplain why mobile phones have been reported as ringing with no one\nanswering.)\nSo now what? The pilots descend to avoid the local primary radar and head\ntowards a \u2018friendly\u2019 country. After this, who knows? I would only be writing a\nTom Clancy after this point.\nSadly, I agree with you. I think this is the most plausible explanation\nconsidering what we know so far.\nCan anyone clarify how does hypoxia work? How long until you are incapacitated\nor even dead at 45,000 feet? Could someone sabotage the plane so that oxygen\nmasks weren\u2019t deployed automatically?\nThanks\nif somebody was in controll \u2013 rather than it being an accident \u2013 it means the\nplance might have been landed somewhere and people may still be alive. and\nthere is still a chance to save them. that\u2019s pretty exciting.\nthis \u201cjet saved for later use\u201d idea doesn\u2019t really work for me either. you\nbetter bet moment that plane gets on any radar the world will be on it. and if\nthey don\u2019t give an explanation for themselves instantly they\u2019ll be taken down\nin seconds.\nI don\u2019t know if it was something/one on board or some other goal but I don\u2019t\nthink it was literally the jet. I think taking the jet was a means to an end.\n& yeah the captain was said to have a flight simulator at his home. I suppose\nthat means he could have been practicing this.\nI don\u2019t know why some people seem to get so excited whenever there\u2019s some idea\nof a terrorist, or hijacking, or sabotage angle. I personally just want them\nto find the plane, as soon as they possibly can.\nRight now this is hinging on whether or not Rolls Royce and Boeing received\nmore signals from the planes engines after 1:07am or Not. The only other\npossibility there could be is if there is some technology which could somehow\nblock that signal; I cannot imagine any way the signal could be turned off\nunless the engines themselves are turned off.\nIf more signals were received, then the plane could be anywhere that it would\nhave potential to fly until the last signal was received. If no more signals\nwere received, the plane is somewhere at the bottom of the Gulf of Thailand.\nAt least that\u2019s what I\u2019m going by until I read somewhere that there is some\nother possible explanation.\n\u201cThe data reporting system, they believe, was shut down 1:07 a.m. The\ntransponder \u2014 which transmits location and altitude \u2014 shut down at 1:21 a.m.\nThis indicates it may well have been a deliberate act, ABC News aviation\nconsultant John Nance said.\u201d\nThat info is just wrong! The 1:07 time refers to the last signal that Rolls\nRoyce received from the engines (at least the last official report from Rolls\nRoyce to Malaysian Airlines), and they\u2019ve said that they receive those signals\nfrom their engines, if running, every 30 minutes. No one \u201cshut down\u201d anything\nat 1:07, it was just the time of the last received signal.\nThen at 1:30, or 1:21, whichever, was the last location received from the\ntransponder.\nThat means, if Rolls Royce did in fact not receive another signal from the\nengine after 1:07 that something happened to the plane sometime between\n1:21/1:30 and 1:37 when the next signal would\u2019ve been received by Rolls Royce.\nThe big issue right now is the contradictory info that\u2019s floating around the\nInternet\u2026 Did Rolls Royce receive more signals from the plane\u2019s engines for\nsome hours after the transponder stopped sending location info, or did they\nnot receive more signals after 1:07, which is what they\u2019ve officially told\nMalaysian Airlines.\nI read somewhere (here?) that one of the pilots had a flight simulator program\nof his own, and it included the 777. He could have practiced the following\nscenario:\n1: Immediately upon takeoff, inform passengers in-flight web and wifi are down\ndue to technical issues and apologize for the inconvenience.\n2: Once out over open waters, turn off transponders, gently descend below\nradar altitudes and set a new course. No passengers would notice as it is\nnight and thus dark outside. Navigation by simple charts, a ruler, and a\ncalculator would not be impossible, man has been doing it for hundreds of\nyears. Just need to know where you are, how fast you are going, and where you\nwant to go.\n3: There are old airstrips in the region, abandoned after WWII, big enough to\nland a 777, and big enough for takeoff. These jets can use, and are designed\nto use, radio guidance systems for landing. Setting one up would probably not\nbe that difficult for someone with access to the technology. As the plane\napproaches, simple radio communication is established with the \u201cground crew,\u201d\non an oddball pre-arranged frequency, and the system is activated.\n4: Plane lands, camouflaged to look like jungle, while real jungle provides\ncover for hijackers and the ground crew.\n5: Plane \u201crepurposed\u201d to be weapon delivery system.\nIt may sound farfetched, but it is possible. It is amazing what determined\npeople can pull off, history is full of such stories.\nAnd no one on September 10, 2001 thought 4 jets could be simultaneously\nhijacked and used as cruise missiles.\nI disagree with this. The \u201cbeauty\u201d of the 9/11 scheme was that it was so\nbasic, so low-tech, and so EASY to pull off. The only weapon they really\nneeded was the element of surprise. This other idea is so fraught with\ncomplications, logistical and technological\u2026\nSure maybe the passengers were asleep and might not have noticed, but it is\nhighly unlikely that the entire plane crew was in on it and not have noticed\nthe deviation from flight path. What is the protocol for the stewards if they\nfeel the pilot is out of control? Well, I guess contacting the air traffic\ncontrol tower directly would have been the first impulse, but the data sender\nwas turned off, so what was their alternative, storm the cockpit, struggle\u2026?\nIf so, passengers would have gotten involved too, in which case the plane\nwould have had to destabilize pressure in order to disorient them, right?\nif the pilot or somebody else\u2019s goal was just to crash the plane \u2014 I see no\nreason to take time to cut off all communication. just get on with crashing\nthe plane.\nI think whoever masterminded the cutting off of communication either intended\nto foil a terrorists ability to communicate with the greater world \u2014 which\npossibly did then result in a crash.\nOR they intended to take the plane somwhere without being discovered. and they\nintended to survive.\ngiven the controlled timing of the shut off \u2014 for maximum confusion \u2014 I\u2019d\nsuspect the plane was then meant to be landed somewhere.\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/us-officials-malaysia-airline-crashed-\nindian-ocean/story?id=22894802\nTwo U.S. officials tell ABC News the U.S. believes that the shutdown of two\ncommunication systems happened separately on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. One\nsource said this indicates the plane did not come out of the sky because of a\ncatastrophic failure.\n\u201cThe data reporting system, they believe, was shut down 1:07 a.m. The\ntransponder \u2014 which transmits location and altitude \u2014 shut down at 1:21 a.m.\nThis indicates it may well have been a deliberate act, ABC News aviation\nconsultant John Nance said.\u201d\nwow. it\u2019s been looking deliberate for while but when they say it officially it\ngets more \u2026. wow.\nMAYBE it was an attempted hijacking/terrorism and the pilots chose to take the\nplane out of contact and down rather than let the terrorists start a war.\nhowever \u2014 I get so tripped up that it happened RIGHT after signing off from\nMalaysian contact and before Chinese \u2014 seems only person why could have chose\nthat precise timing is pilot.\nFiona, please remember that Viet Nam airspace is where MH370 was headed, NOT\nChinese.\noh. didn\u2019t even realize. thanks\nif the turning off of the data system and transponder was deliberate, then\nthey kind of made a mistake of first turning the plane around before turning\noff the transponder, which indicates that things didnt go so smoothly. For\nexample, plane turns off data system, informs the cabin that they will be\nturning around, then there is some disturbance which distracts the pilot from\nfirst turning off transponder before turning the plane around. I mean that\ntransponder was turned off pretty quickly after the plane started turning. It\nwas like the pilot and co-pilot were working together, one was turning off the\nthings and when they started turning and asked each other to confirm if the\ntransponder was turned off, they suddenly did it and said on \u201cgees, now\nthey\u2019ll be on to us.\u201d I then wonder how that fact could have affected the rest\nof their plan.\nthat;s a good point \u2014 from that poerspective it looks more like problem\nsolving in moment of crisis than anything sinister\nim no expert bt I asked that somewhere before and I was told that power could\nbe scarse in an emergency \u2014 so they keep the option to eliminate all but the\nmost essential use for it. which I guess would be flying while not talking\nabout it,\nGood point. But how much power would that thing need? Maybe more than I think.\nBut with its importance, I would think it would have a battery back-up or be\nbacked up by all of the other redundancies in an aircraft.\ncorrect \u2014 nothing indicates they \u201cneeded\u201d to turn it off \u2014 thus the deepened\nmystery.\nI don\u2019t know if this question has been addressed/answered here, but I want to\nknow why pilots even have the ability to turn off the transponder? How is it\npossible, in this day and age, that there isn\u2019t something on that aircraft\nconstantly sending data. If the transponder couldn\u2019t be turned off, even by\ndesire or force, we would know where that plane is, correct?\nNew to this discussion, but I have been confounded, captivated and completely\nperplexed by Flight 370. After obsessively reading everything I can online, I\nreally believe that the plane landed somewhere remote and is going to be used\nfor something other than its intended purpose. BTW, has anyone considered the\npassengers may be being held hostage with strict orders to the Malay\ngovernment to keep it quiet? I don\u2019t know\u2026 I just can\u2019t grasp a complete\ndisappearance!\nOK, here\u2019s a bit of completely idol speculation:  \nThe North Koreans somehow \u2018turned\u2019 one of the pilots (say through blackmail)\nand the plane + passengers are now in North Korea. That would sort of match\nthe four hours of continued engine operation (if indeed that is true).\nWouldn\u2019t be the first time the North Koreans have abducted people.\nOf course, this could presumably be checked on primary radar records.\nHow much truth is in this:\nRadar Playback of the Moment Malaysia Flight 370 Vanished!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JpbZZKqxy0\nIt shows the transponder ceasing operation. Maybe. This program is highly\nunreliable and continually shows aircraft disappearing then reappearing. I\u2019m\nenough of a geek to watch it occasionally. \ud83d\ude42\nThis is good for a laugh:\nhttp://www.theonion.com/articles/malaysian-airlines-expands-investigation-to-\ninclud,35524/\nhahahahahya thank you\nOMG I have to get back to work. i have too much of an addiction to mystery.\ni hope they are all found safe. I hope they all just took some crazy mushrooms\nand forgot which way was which. and they landed safely on some island with\nlots of coconuts thinking it was the moon/ and about the time they sober up we\nwill find them and everything will be ok/\nwhat my brain is stuck on now: these pings lasted for ~four hours. and could\nhave come from plane while in air or on land. so plance could have still been\nflying or landed during that time window.\n\u2026\u2026.what would cause the pings to stop after five hours? are destructio or\nsubmersion the only things ? or could it be merely lack of use?\nThe pings come from the engines whilst they are running.\nThis gives the maintenance guys a diary of the engine to see if it needs\nattention anywhere.\nBut apparently that story has now been denied, fiona. Malaysian authorities\nhave said that Rolls-Royse have told them that it was an inaccurate report by\nthe Wall Street Journal.\nAnd again, if that is true, that the last signal from the engines was received\nby Rolls-Royce at 1:07, and such signals are received at 30 minute intervals,\nthen the plane\u2019s engines had to have stopped before 1:37. That leaves a 6-7\nminute window between when the plane was last detected on radar over the Gulf\nof Thailand and when the engines must have cut out. And that\u2019s not enough time\nfor the plane to pass over to the Malacca Strait. The plane must be in the\nGulf of Thailand, if this info/data is true.\nI don\u2019t think they denied it unilaterally, just said it was inaccurate. the\nwsj journalist explained the inaccuracy \u2014 and went on to explain the several\nhours of pings is still valid .\nI\u2019m inclined to believe the wsj here \u2014 esp when they take time to confirm\nWhat the hell? The above was supposed to be a reply to Pelegrin\u2019s reply to\nfiona.\nSomeone must be getting the facts\u2026\u2026\u2026 Press releases are not to be trusted.\nWhen a flight goes missing it usually means an accident, hijacking or\nterrorism.\nThis one is missing thts for sure.\nNo evidence of an accident and hijackers would be letting the world know by\nnow.\nLet\u2019s assume it is not missing\u2026\u2026. Just mislaid\u2026.. Hope so.\nThat\u2019s a good point. In East Asia you should always be careful not to cause\nsomeone to lose face. Bad reactions. And a US media source revealing dynamite\ninformation might be viewed as just that.\nHi Rod \u2013\nAs someone living in Singapore/Malaysia I felt the need to clarify a couple of\npoints:\n1) Malaysia IS NOT East Asia; crony-capitalist Malaysia and state-owned\nMalaysia Air Lines are dominated by ethnic Malays, which by constitutional\ndefinition(!) are Muslim (NB the Muslim surnames of the Pilot and co-pilot).\n[Going from the manifest, roughly half of the rest of the flight crew was\nMalay/Muslim, the other half was Malaysian of Chinese descent (which makes\nsense when flying to Beijing).]\n2) The Malaysian government ARE afraid of looking like idiots, though, and\nsince there is no press freedom in Malaysia they are accustomed to dealing\nwith a lap-dog, state-controlled \u201cPress\u201d that doesn\u2019t ask difficult questions.\n(This is why so many Malaysians get their news elsewhere.)\n3) Malay Malaysians are culturally isolated and speak mostly inside their own\necho-chamber, with little regard to what happens outside it (aside from\nEnglish Premier League football, which is what they have instead of their own\nsports leagues).\n4) Trying to get a straight story from a Malaysian reminds me of this saying:  \n\u201cNever try to teach a mule to sing; it wastes time and annoys the mule\u201d (ok,\nso I paraphrased because of locally-defined animal animosities).\nWhat do these things mean for the search for MH370?  \nThat regardless of what happened to the airplane, the Malaysian\nmilitary/government is not institutionally prepared to or capable of providing\nintelligent, timely, thoughtful, confirmable information to the Malaysian\npublic, let alone to the Chinese or the rest of the world.\nNot sure that everyone will think these points illuminating, but felt that\nthey needed to be added into the equation.\nThanks! The cultural insight is useful!\nso helpful!!\nI do know Malaysia and where it is. And even if the Chinese portion of the\npopulation is lower than it used to be, I would say that you should exercise\nthe same face-saving caution that you would in any other \u201cConfucian-\ninfluenced\u201d society. (That goes triple for Singapore.)\nSo \u201clooking like an idiot\u201d is certainly losing face. And to have a bunch of\nforeigners correcting all your false leads and contradictory statements must\nbe kinda embarrassing.\nI\u2019m kinda getting ove my pilot suicide idea. I just can\u2019t figure it with the\nco-pilot and crew present \u2013 and such a long term descent.\nI am right now realizing \u2014 it\u2019s not that tere are a number of possibilities \u2014\nit\u2019s more that zero explanation really perfectly fits.\nor at least close to zero/\nHeh Nicholas, don\u2019t mock\u2026\u2026.. US intelligence will be thinking along this\nlines. That\u2019s for sure.\nEvery possibility is being considered\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nI\u2019m sure that US intelligence and investigators would like nothing more than\nto be able cut Malaysian authorities out of the information loop except for\nfinite information regarding where the plane will ultimately be found, when\nit\u2019s found.\nI think the Malaysians are lying when they say the rolls royse data does not\nexist. I think this because rolls royse now says they are not allowed to\ncomment due to status of investigation. IF they agreed with the Malaysians\nsurely they would be allowed to confirm the statement that the Malaysians are\nmaking.\n& I think it\u2019s meaningful that the Malaysinans want this info suppressed.\nI SUSPECT it\u2019s because they suspect something they don\u2019t want publicized,\nsomething that would put them at fault \u2014 like pilot suicide. but now I\u2019m\nleading the evidence to mean what i want it to mean \u2014 still that\u2019s what i\nthink\nThat\u2019s all extremely short-sighted, and I don\u2019t think anyone directly involved\nin this search is that naive. Eventually the plane will be found and the story\nwill come out. I think that Malaysians don\u2019t like that they\u2019re being kept in\nthe dark about certain intelligence information, and that these pieces of info\nare being released to the public before they hear about them directly. And\nthen, when they ask directly, they\u2019re getting different information, and all\nthey\u2019re doing is telling the public the official story as they have it, not\nstories with speculative or secret sources that they themselves have not\nconfirmed.\nhmm. i dunno. they are being very misleading to say only \u201cthat\u2019s not accurate\u201d\ninstead of saying \u2014 that\u2019s partically true and partially not here\u2019s exactly\nwhy. \u2026\nbut as I\u2019ve been readin it\u2019s kinda the nature of their gov to communicate like\nthey are, with controll a priority and trancparency out the window. so maybe\nit\u2019s not as significant as I see it to be. our gov has plenty of issues in\ncommunicating to public too, sure every gov does. dunnnnnnooooooo\nIt\u2019s only merely a government thing in most cases, but rather a cultural\nthing. I believe the idea is that they are the authorities in charge and that\nthey should principally be communicating to the public only what is confirmed\nand official. And that other such sources are inappropriate to communicate\ncertain information directly and not through official channels.\nNot saying that\u2019s my perspective about how things should always be done, but\nthat it\u2019s probably how the Malaysians view it.\nClarification and further insight from the WSJ reporter:\nhttp://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/03/13/malaysia-plane-pasztor\nthanks for posting! just listened.\nso sounds like it was a technicality malasia was objecting to \u2014 not the gyst\nof the onfo.\ni wonder if they suspect it landed because they can see indicative-of-landing\ndata. i feel they\u2019d have to have some speciic reason to think it landed rather\nthan crashed \u2013 other than just that it flew for a few more hours.\nThat was incredibly helpful. So it seems this may not be ACARS data\nspecifically since such data is very simple and coherent and wouldn\u2019t take any\ntime to analyze. The satellites must be processing a more raw form of data\ntransmission directly from the engines that probably gets processed into ACARS\nbefore being sent out. Which suggest ACARS transmission was out like the\ntransponder.\nThe one criticism I would have of the reporter is that I would not have passed\nthrough the speculation about landing if only for unfairly getting the hopes\nup for the families.\nHave to give credit to Mick upthread for suggesting this as well.\nIf in fact there was no tracking information from the plane received after\n1:07 a.m. Saturday, as Rolls-Royce and Boeing have reported directly to\nMalaysia Airlines\u2026  \n[Quote]But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Thursday\nthat Rolls-Royce and Boeing have reported that they didn\u2019t receive\ntransmissions of any kind after 1:07 a.m. Saturday. Air traffic controllers\nlost contact with the plane shortly afterward, around 1:30 a.m.[Quote]\u2026  \nAnd that sort of tracking information is received every 30 minutes, then the\nlast moments the plane\u2019s engines could\u2019ve been working would have to have been\nat 1:36am. That also means that the plane could not have been that with was\nspotted on radar over Malacca Strait, and it means that the plane must be\nsomewhere in the waters of the Gulf of Thailand.\nIf that data is correct and reliable, then there is no other possibility! The\nplane was over the Gulf at 1:30am, it could not have gone anywhere at\nsignificant distance in 6 minutes.\nI\u2019d be interesrted to know if pilot had any sad or angering stuff going on in\nhis life. \u2014 very sad I know a man his same age actually resembles him a tad bt\nand just got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, \u2014 mild boggling even beyond\nphysically \u2013 emotionally for him/\nit\u2019s in back of my mind \u2014 could some devasting news like this have set this\npilot into a psychological place where \u2014 he wanted to take plane with him.\ncould have been so many things.\ntotal speculation. but pics of his don\u2019t show family. perhaps he had too\nlittle support for whatever turn of events he was facing/ perhaps it was\nllittle more than compounding lonliness.\nWell, a Singaporean 737 crashed in Sumatra some years ago, and the consensus\nwas it was pilot suicide (financial troubles, etc. etc.). That conclusion\nsuited everybody, especially Boeing.\nIt took some very determined detective work and general tree-shaking to\nreveal, in the end, that it was a fault in the 737.\nDozens, if not hundreds, of scenarios are possible. At this point they are all\nequally valid/invalid.\nUnderstood\u2026I\u2019m interested too. I guess I just don\u2019t get it. There is a lot of\nspeculation\u2026and yes it is fun\u2026but it\u2019s all based on what \u2018facts\u2019 we think we\nknow\u2026when in fact\u2026due to how all this is coming out\u2026do we really have \u2018any\u2019\nfacts (other than a plane is missing)? Every day we\u2019re told this\u2026then get that\nreversed the next day. It\u2019s all so convoluted\u2026I\u2019m beginning to question\neverything\u2026and I mean everything\u2026other than the one fact that flight 370\ndidn\u2019t make it to Beijing.\nI think thats good detective thinking \u2014 to question everything.\nI also think it may be a clue that some of the information is discounted. i\u2019m\nnot sure what it means \u2014 but there could turn out to be information in the\ndenials as much as in the evidence.\n\u2026 interest in\u2026 and following this story.\nReally have to be careful on this site, since there is not editing feature.\nHey\u2026you mentioned no editting\u2026was it something I typed?\nReplied to Nicholas Robinson, but the comments are meant for all of us who are\nobviously interesting and following this story.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nhow do you not speculate on a mystery of this scope????\nto me it\u2019s human nature to want to solve the puzzle with whatever info you can\nget your hands on \u2014\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nMy last message came across a little mean. Although I guess it\u2019s somewhat fun\nto speculate\u2026some of these come across as \u2018Here is what happened\u2019\u2026and to state\nthe truth\u2026no one on this blog knows. I think someone does\u2026but no one here. Its\nall guesswork\u2026\nWe agree on that then, yes someone knows and not just the crew\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s why we\nall need to push for answers.\nNot inclined to believe the malaysians are so incompetant\u2026\u2026\u2026. But feel they\nare desperate to save face.\nagreed enough to say \u2014 yes, I don\u2019t know. maybe I should add that more clearly\neach time.\nbut I want to know. I want to know so much that I cannot stop speculating.\nthough \u2014 whatever \u2014- to say we can\u2019t know is about as true.\nUltimately we are all pretty helpless in being able to do something meaningful\n(though if we had a general area, the crowdsourcing of scanning sat images\ncould be helpful). I\u2019d say most people are inclined to want contribute and be\nuseful in the face of tragedy. So I think there\u2019s a certain therapeutic aspect\nto these discussions in terms of dealing with the feelings of helplessness.\nAnd, of course, there is also the mystery aspect, which is perhaps a more\nselfish motivation. But it is human.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nUgh\u2026all the uninformed speculation. I\u2019m with the person that said when this is\nover\u2026and the plane is found\u2026all the theories\u2026all the \u2018brilliant ideas\u2019 will\nall be seen as a foolish waste of time.\nNot a waste of time, if people didn\u2019t speculate and ask the questions we would\nbe machines\u2026\u2026. Operated by the \u201cinstructors \u201c\nI wonder if the pilot was suicidal . it\u2019s pure speculation \u2014 he looks harmless\nand normal/ and his final comment is so benine. but\u2013 it\u2019s a little like some\nparent calmly driving their family into the ocean/\njust choose \u2013 turn \u2014 set the course \u2014 and let it happen.\nthe fact that the new course happened just at the moment between being in\ncommunication with Malaysia and China \u2014 I think that was strategic/as \u0010it was\nso effective \u2013 to literally slip under the radar like that at the most\nopportune time to to deflect tracking.\nI would think only the pilot or somebody equally knowledgeable and privy to\nthis exact flight could execute that timing of flipping off communication/ if\nit wasn\u2019t the pilot the sabatour(s) would also have to gain access and\ncontroll right after the pilot said goodnight and right before the ideal\nmoment to shut off communication. that\u2019s like hitting the moon with an arrow,\ntwice in a row IMO.\nI think the pilot did this. either the pilot or the co-pilot and I don\u2019t know\nwhat the other was doing.\nthat \u201calright, goodnight\u201d was no \u2014 nothing\u2013 as last words \u2014 I was frustrated\nto be be able to place meaning on it \u2014 but now I see \u2014 it meant the person\nsaying it was not under duress. and yet communication was switched off moments\nlater. if there was a sudden explosion \u2013 then thats not suspicious \u2014 but now\nthat it\u2019s looking like the plane continued to fly for at least an hour of rour\nmore \u2014 speaking calmly right before communication got shut off \u2014 suddenly\nbecomes suspicious.\nI\u2019m so sure that when the truths finally come out \u2014 that the wreckage is\nfinally found on the side of some misbegotten hillside of a dense rain forest\nwhere no one at all expected it to be, and the FDRs have been examined,\neveryone is going to just walk on home, shoulders hunched, saying something\nlike \u201cI KNEW it was going to be something mundane like this.\u201d\nBut as I said in an earlier, rambling and somewhat hysterical comment (at\nleast three days ago now \u2014 seems like a century!) the aviation community must\nsomehow take this as a massive wake-up call. This doesn\u2019t just apply to the\nAsian side of things, even though I believe I noted that in the Asian area\nalone, the number of people getting on planes is expected to double or triple\nin the next ten years or so (sorry if my numbers are not accurate, but you get\nthe idea) \u2014 it\u2019s just that this kind of thing, as inconceivable as it might be\nto us all over the world, no matter what nationality \u2014 must not be allowed to\nbe able to occur in ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER. From the insidious apparent\nbungling of all the \u201cauthorities\u201d involved \u2013and if one looked at this incident\nwith a jaundiced eye, one would have to seriously call into question these\npeople\u2019s designations as legitimate \u201cauthorities\u201d \u2014 one must be resigned to\nadmitting that no matter WHAT happened to this plane, the \u201cpowers-that-be\u201d are\nsorely inadequate to the task of finding a crashed Hindenburg or a Titanic,\nlet alone this instrument-bristling marvel of modern technology.\nIt is truly a sad commentary on the ability \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to point any\nfingers, but let\u2019s just call them \u201cthe folk who reside east of Katmandu\u201d \u2014 of\nthese people to get a handle on ANYTHING, let alone the whereabouts of the\nplane. They are simply too busy stepping on each other\u2019s feet, criticizing and\ncontradicting each other\u2019s findings, and just generally squabbling like a pack\nof schoolchildren when what they should be doing is coming together in a\nvisibly united front, a damn-the-torpedoes, we\u2019re-all-in-this-together sort of\nthing that at this point in time seems like a Disney fable.\nThe plane WILL be found. We WILL find out what happened to it. But meanwhile,\nthe circus surrounding the search is not a great commentary on our supposedly\n\u201ctechnologically advanced\u201d 21st Century achievements.\nI don\u2019t even want to wander into the territory of what all this must be like\nfor the relatives. I wish there were some unified address where we public Joes\ncould at least send our wishes of support and encouragement. I have no idea\nwhat mood I would be in if one or several of my family were in that plane, but\nit would probably really make a big difference to me knowing that a whole\nbunch of strangers from all over the world were pulling for me and not letting\nme feel how alone I would most undoubtedly feel at this moment.\nIn some ways, I think many expect more from our modern technology than what\nactually exists. And I don\u2019t necessarily think that the Malaysian government\nhas been stumbling all of itself. I think it\u2019s simply been trying not to give\npublic expectation one way or another until it has confirmation, one way or\nanother, that something is true.\nNow yes, I do think that there are or certainly could be technological\nresources that could be used to help find this plane, but in the area of such\npotential technology a lot of it is secret, and those in charge of it probably\naren\u2019t going to let it out of the bag in order to resolve some case of a\nmissing airplane, no matter that there were 239 people on board. They look at\nwhat they think is \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d and that is of keeping the black cat\nin the box. But part of what\u2019s been happening here, and making all sides look\nbad, is that ideas might be being leaked out which are intended to get people\nlooking in the right direction, but without making it official. The Malaysian\nmilitary obviously did that with the first hints that the plane was possibly\nseen on the west side of the peninsula, but that was small fry compared to any\ninformation that US intelligence might possibly be leaking out.\nNo matter though how much intelligence actually exists, there is still a vast\narea, oceans and jungles, and that\u2019s not even to consider some hijacking the\nplane that could\u2019ve taken it and hidden it some place, which this plane\ncould\u2019ve disappeared into. And there are literally thousands of planes in the\nair at any one time; and with most of them being commercial airliners, I\u2019m\nsure that no intelligence anywhere in the world is watching every single\naircraft at every minute of its flight. If satellites functioned like radar,\nwhich as far as I know (Haha) they do not, then perhaps there could be an\neventually assembled map of information regarding where this plane headed, but\nstill that would mean checking virtually every single blimp in the general\narea and trying to pin-point what it related to, and slowly eliminating all\nuntil you have the only ones left that could be the trajectory of this flight.\nThis plane disappeared at what is considered to be it\u2019s time of being most\nsafe, but also at it\u2019s time of being most invisible to track if some part of\nit\u2019s tracking capabilities malfunctioned or was deliberately turned off. Does\nthat make it possible to find a way to find it, NO. But it shouldn\u2019t in any\nway be considered easy. And the fact that it did happen at that apparently\nsafest part of the flight, when the flight could be at its most invisible,\ndoesn\u2019t make it any more suspicious. It just tells us that there is no\ncertainty of anything. These are still machines which can go afoul or human\nerror can still happen.\nWe are not quite perfect yet, and in so many ways!\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nwhat I don\u2019t get about the wsj report is this: if they got engine data every\nthirty minutes how can they say they plane flew for 5 hours. data that comes\nthirty minute intervals is always going to give you a window of 29 minutes\nwhen you don\u2019t know if the engine was still going or not. unless the final\ndata involves the stopping of the engine.\notherwise the only way to ulatlize the info (I would think) is to say the\nplane flew for at least 5 hours but at 5 1/2 hours the engine did not send\ndata so we believe the plane engine ceased functioning or was nolonger in use\nsometime between five and five and a half hours after takeoff.\nPresumably the engines stopped after 5 hours which could mean on landing or\nditching\u2026\u2026. Either way if this source is reliable then all the searching in\nthe areas at the moment is a waste of time.\nI can\u2019t help feeling that someone knows but we are not being told.\nStarting to feel like the start of a James bond film.\nya. I wish Liam neison was on that plane.\nThere were some folk with lots of very useful knowledge though\u2026\u2026. I can\u2019t\nimagine how awful this is for all the families waiting and waiting\u2026\u2026 If we all\nfeel frustrated with this mystery how must they feel?\nPlease God we all get answers soon.\nMy God, that is EXACTLY how I felt a couple of days ago . . . that the\nmysterious Dr. Don\u2019tknow sand his evil minions have somehow diverted MH370 off\nits intend flight path and into his secret hangar on a desolate island in the\nNew Hebrides.\nI can almost see Sean Connery up there, just having pulled off his tuxedo to\nreveal his black skin-tight dry suit, binoculars in hand, way up above the\naircraft in a convenient cubbyhole in the dark walls of the monstrous cavern,\nwatching the technicians in their white suits scurry to and fro all over the\naircraft, which is in impeccable shape after being falsely laser-guided into\nlanding on the well-hidden 6,000 foot landing strip on Don\u2019tknow\u2019s mysterious\nisland.\nNow all we need to know is what evil intentions Don\u2019tknow has for the plane,\nand whether Sean will be able to thwart them . . . next up, the sharkquarium!\nI\u2019d expect wsj checked their sources. but \u2014 be nice if they sources were\nrechecked.\nthose Malaysians sure are in the spotlight!! their gov got a goofy way of\nrelaying information. just deny deny \u2014 but don\u2019t explain the contradiction.\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and call it very annoying.\nthey got some quote out \u201d it\u2019s only confusing if you want to see it as being\nconfusing\u2019.\u201d\nonly the way they said it is more confusing than that I can\u2019t qiote remember.\nhaha. ahhh.\nmy theory is still \u2014 kidnapping. but there might be all sorts of political\ndynamics that have nothing to do with us or iran or any country i can even\nguess \u2014 this could have to do with Malaysia itself \u2026 all i can say is i\u2019m\nengrossed in the mystery and i love feeling somehow they might all still be\nalive.\nMe too Fiona. This is all pointing to a well planned operation\u2026\u2026 I do hope the\nmystery will be resolved soon.\nThe ACARS data is TX using VHF HF or Satellite up-link.  \nI dont believe this Plane had or used the Sat up-link option.  \nJust because the ACARS base station did not pick up the TX from ACARS does not\nmean it was not sent and picked up by US Intel, Spy Sats or other listening\nposts.  \nUS could also pick up any passenger cell phone TX from this plane, even though\nout of range of cellphone base stations.  \nSounds like US Intel knows the plane flew for 4-5 hours and have a rough idea\nof where it\u2019s ended up in the Indian Ocean.  \nWe only have a vague idea as to capabilities of US Spy Sats and no doubt the\nUSA is keen to give us as little clue as possible as to their true\ncapabilities.  \nNo doubt time will tell.\nSeveral posts have directly mentioned or alluded to a cockpit electrical fire,\nsuch as the Egyptian Air in July 2011. Presumably all airlines certified that\nnonconductive material was in place to prevent another fire.  \nLet me ask this: if another cause for an ignition in the cockpit forced pilot\nand first officer to instinctively and immediately evacuate because of intense\nheat or flames, then shut the reinforced door behind them, could the plane\nhave continued flying? Is the cpu in a separate compartment? the oil rig\nworker saw a flaming object in the sky, then the flames faded. Could the\naircraft\u2019s nose area have burned without compromising structural integrity for\nthe fuselage and wings? Could overheated circuitry have commanded autopilot to\nturn? Are there any avionics technicians or aeronautical engineers reading\nthese posts? Or is that for another website?\nWhy are Malaysian officials disputing the report that the plane kept flying\nfor 4 or 5 hours? The report mentioned by the Wall Street Journal appears to\nbe quite official regarding US investigators. So what evidence do Malaysian\nofficials have to dispute that report?\nYes, except no named officials. I get that papers want to first but this\nconstant citing of people unwilling to back up their statements with their\nnames has gotten to the point of ridiculousness.\nBut it is a little weird that the WSJ piece says engine data was transmitted\nfor hours while in another report Rolls Royce said they received only two\nACARS messages, both before the disappearance. The gulf between that reporting\nis a mile wide.\nI find it also amazing that the main players here: Boeing, Rolls Royce and\nother manufacturers connected with the 777 are not only NOT stepping up to the\nplate to defend either themselves or their products, but are actually keeping\nas silent as possible. Holding any cards that *might* point to failures on any\nof their equipments\u2019 parts to protect their reputations.\nLike the A-380 explosion of the Rolls-Royce Trent engine on the Qantas plane\nseveral hers ago, Rolls Royce chose, in lieu of stepping to the front of the\nfray and participating in the general uproar surrounding the incident, instead\ndecided to \u201cwithhold all comment,\u201d which extended to not participating in any\nway in several investigative journals-type stories done by various media about\nthe incident.\nHiding behind Mummy\u2019s dress when things you might have been responsible for\ndid (I love this euphemism) not \u201cturn out necessarily to your favor\u201d \u2014 is not\nonly cowardly, but it\u2019s totally counter-productive to your image as a world-\nclass provider of technology that fuels our confidence in today\u2019s aviation\nindustry.\nIn my mind at least, Rolls Royce took an indelible hit for that one \u2014 I will\npersonally never view them in the same hallowed light again that I once saw\nthem in. And no amount of backpedalling after the fact will save them from\nthat initial \u201cguilty\u201d stance \u2014 it\u2019s reminiscent of the worst pathetic denials\nof wrongdoing by politicians or even nations when the facts quite obviously\npoint to their obvious complicity in the whole affair.\nDeny deny deny is going to get you exactly NOWHERE. Well, it WILL get you\nsomewhere \u2014 in MY black books, at least. It\u2019s especially galling when no one\nis outright accusing you of ANYTHING, yet you set the denial machine into\noperation anyway. Rolls Royce or Boeing should have absolutely NOTHING to hide\nin this saga. Why then, are they not putting their engineers alongside the\ntalking heads on these news shows to explain some things about the equipment\nTHEY manufactured? It would not only remove suspicions as to the reliability\nof their product but actually lend a humanitarian spin to their respective\nimages \u2014 and I don\u2019t know many large corporations who are very good at\nprojecting any sort of \u201chumanitarian spin.\u201d\nInstead, they dig their graves deeper with every missed opportunity to come\nout and explain \u2014 or at the very least, PARTICIPATE \u2014 in this mind-numbing and\nsoul-shattering process of finding this thing.\nSo, RR, makers of the vaunted Trent engine, can you tell us a little bit more\nin detail just what this noise is about your engines reporting back to base\nevery thirty minutes, instead of hiding behind your corporate curtain and\ninsisting you have nothing to do with anything? On the contrary, this case may\nHINGE upon your machinery, so, umm, what\u2019s up, anyways?\nAnd Boeing: I think they\u2019re a step above Airbus in the Blame Game but still,\nit\u2019s not enough. Their frantic denials and mindless reassurances in the wake\nof the 787 debacle said *not much* about their corporate ethics, and I would\nexpect that in THIS case, in which NO ONE is pointing any fingers at any\nfailure of the 777 \u2014 far from it \u2014 indeed, inordinate amounts of praise are\nshowering forth from all quarters \u2014 why aren\u2019t THEIR panel of experts\nparticipating along with all the retired FAA and NTSB guys and gals on all\nthese talk shows? It would most definitely give them some credibility, if not\nshow off their unquestioning support for the devastated families of the now-\ncertainly deceased aboard the plane that rolled out onto the tarmac of THEIR\nFACILITIES in Seattle not so many decades ago.\nIn this case, regrettably, their silence shrieks volumes.\nSorry, my \u201cauto-complete\u201d gets it wrong almost as often as news sources about\nthis missing plane. I hereby take full responsibility for my computer\u2019s missed\nsteaks.\nRegarding Rolls\u2019 \u201csilence\u201d on the ACARS issue:\nForm what I understand, both Boeing and Rolls are prohibited by international\nlaw from revealing the contents of the ACARS reports to anyone other than\ninvestigation officials, in an emergency situation. (I presume this is to\nprevent them from holding the info \u201chostage\u201d to the highest media bidder.)\nIt seems to be standard procedure for these situations for the spokespeople\nfrom Boeing, etc to say \u201cWe can\u2019t comment\u201d because legally they cannot. The\nMalaysian government has repeatedly said that they are working closely with\nBoeing and Rolls, to figure out if the ACARS data gives any clues to this\nmystery.\nRolls has done nothing wrong. Neither has Boeing, in terms of the ACARS data.\nThey are following the law and assisting the investigation.\nSo my understanding of ACARS is that the ground networks that collect the data\nand, according to wiki, there are two (ARINC and SITA), provide the data to\ninterested parties for a fee. Given the fact that there\u2019s not yet a lot of\ndirect competition and ultimately not a lot of potential customers, I imagine\nthe fees might be quite high. Thus it seems possible that some airlines may go\nwithout ACARS streams and/or have only \u201cbasic\u201d plans if there are such things.\nAfter all there are a lot of more traditional ways to keep track of their\nequipment.\nBTW, they have considered increasing the capability of ACARS to be be more\nlike an instantaneous \u201cblack box\u201d but the cost/benefit is apparently not good\nat present.\nThat was supposed to be in reply to Miguel\u2019s question about whether Malaysian\nAirlines would be getting ACARS in addition to Rolls Royce and Boeing.\nthank you Richard.\nMobile phones require cell towers within a few miles to operate. No cell\ntowers mid ocean! Inflight cell phone systems require a satcom link system\ninstalled on the plane. No system was on this plane and even if there was, a\ncatastrophic electrical failure that would knock out the cockpit HF and/or\nsatcom systems as well as transponder would also most likely kill any inflight\ncell relay system.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] Ask The Pilot: The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 \u2014 \u201cAll we know\nfor sure is that a plane went missing with no warning or communication from\nthe crew. That the crash (assuming the plane did in fact go down) did not\nhappen during takeoff or landing \u2014 the phases of flight when most accidents\noccur \u2014 somewhat limits the possibilities, but numerous ones remain. The\nculprit could be anything from sabotage to some kind of bizarre mechanical\nproblem \u2014 or, as is so common in airline catastrophes, some combination or\ncompounding of human error and/or mechanical malfunction.\u201d [\u2026]\nYeah, point four is far to specific. You might or might not be able to\nidentify the sex of the person who briefly mumbled over the radio but you are\nnot likely to be identify the person unless A) you know them AND B) they have\na very unique voice pitch.\nI have a question in mind that the numbers have given by the airline authority\nof Malaysia doesn\u2019t work in emergency situations. It is too frustrating time\nfor a family person.\nMeant to say that maybe this was all planned from the start? The plane with\nit\u2019s passengers could be ok but in the hands of god knows who\u2026..\nNow the Malays say the latest debris spotted is nothing to do with the missing\nplane\u2026\u2026\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nHoly crap! Just when it seemed that this might be getting close to a close\nwith those satellite images from China.\nSo guys, how about this\u2026 The pilots appeared to have closed down their normal\ncommunications at night shortly before the plane went off radar. Could it be\npossible to assume that flying at that hour and at altitude that then the\npilots might not try to communicate with the ground until they got near to\nBeijing or at least into Chinese territory? If so, then just perhaps they\nnever new that the plane had lost its capability to communicate with the\nground until they next tried to communicate with the ground; and by then it\nmight have been too late to turn back to home base, KL. So there they are,\nflying somewhere over the South China Sea or over China and they can\u2019t\ncommunicate.\nReally though, that idea seems ridiculous, because certainly somehow they\ncould\u2019ve found a way to communicate with all the communication devices that\nwould\u2019ve been on board that plane.\nIt seems that the theory which was being discussed yesterday on here, that all\non board had become incapacitated by a loss of oxygen, and the plane flew for\nhours until it finally went down on its own from being out of fuel. If it flew\non its route, it would\u2019ve went down somewhere north of Beijing. Would China\nhave not noticed or allowed an aircraft flying over its territory without\ncommunication with the ground? Or, Flight 370 was in fact that plane observed\non Malaysian military radar flying over Malacca Strait in almost the opposite\ndirection, probably after a failed attempt to get back to KL. The plane is in\nthe middle of the Indian Ocean.\nHas anyone considered that the captain was being blackmailed?\nHe left Malaysian airspace, did not proceed on flight plan and all\ncommunication apparatus ceased to be operating.\nApparently the engines continued for another four hours.\nFrom what I have read the flight altitude dropped enough to evade radar but\nnot enough to counter a decompression effect.\nI do agree with you guys that the transponder is the big mystery. Could a\npilot being starved of oxygen turn it off by mistake?\nTaken on its own merit, the transponder stopping suggests either a hijacking\nor explosion but there\u2019s no evidence for those. No debris anywhere near the\nplane\u2019s last known position and no public statements or demands from any\nterrorist organisation, and I presume publicity would have been the prime goal\nof any alleged bad guys.\nRegarding the Malaysian military denying the earlier radar reports, it might\nbe a case of them not wanting their neighbours to know what capabilities the\nradar has (or doesn\u2019t have).\nI still think the plane came down west, possibly far to the west, of Malaysia\nbut I suppose anything is possible.\nSorry. Posted at the wrong location.\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\n[\u2026] The Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 [\u2026]\nSurely the American military, with all their assets, can pinpoint exactly\nwhere this plane went down. Or are we to believe that a missile, launched from\nthis part of the world, would not be detected. No doubt that would keep North\nKorea very happy. Its time that the US gave real positions, they don\u2019t need to\ngive us the pictures.\nTheir communication and mayday device broke due to electronic fire, so they\nwerent able to communicate with Vietnam before entering their airspace, and in\norder to avoid seeming threatening to Vietnam, they turned off their\ntransponder, lowered altitude and turned around back to KL, but Malaysia sees\nthem as dangerous unidentified plane and shoots them down, the Malaysia\nairline holds up notifying the public about the missing flight meanwhile the\nmilitary cleans up the mess. Chinese satellite image is image of the plane but\nin a different spot, the real spot, Chinese give image to public (but give\ndifferent coordinates) in order to show Malaysia that it knows more than it\nseems. Malaysia upset that didnt show them the image first, but actually\nworried the Chinese know too much. There was another image by a Chicago IT guy\nthat seems to show the airplane in the water, with a big boat connected on its\nside, they were trying to clean up the evidence\u2026\nThat\u2019s a lot of interesting geo-political intrigue but my impression is that\nfew countries have a motivation for blowing things up that enter their\nairspace.\n1 \u2013 Persons attributing competence and/or professionalism to Malaysian\nmilitary or government employees are likely to be disappointed. Witness the\nlack of information from Malaysian government sources. They don\u2019t know how to\nrun a press conference. Nor, apparently, Xerox machines.\n2 \u2013 While scrambling a couple of F-16s to investigate violation of sovereign\nairspace may seem like a natural response to residents of the lower 48, the\nMalaysian Air Force has (drastically!) different priorities.\nYes, SOMEthing happened. Whether Malaysia will be a help or hindrance in\nfiguring it out is an open question, between the constantly new revelations of\ndays-old facts and the two-steps-forward-one-step-back aspects we\u2019re all\ngetting tired of.\nI\u2019m guessing that the US NTSB people and/or the UN\u2019s ICAO will separate the\nwheat from the chaff much faster than anyone local, simply because of\ndeveloped expertise in those institutions and the lack thereof in Malaysia.\nAt this point, the most likely explanation (from \u201cthe Pilot\u201d) is massive\nelectrical/mechanical failure, but malevolent intent can\u2019t yet be ruled out\neither.\nIt would really help us if the Malaysian authorities would  \n1) SHARE what they know, and  \n2) BE RELIABLE in what they tell the world.  \nThose two things would help a LOT.\nI was just wondering if somebody can tell me how far could the signal  \nFrom the black box be heard? Are they not supposed to make  \nSome kind of alarm? Even under water?\nHere\u2019s the wiki on \u201cblack boxes\u201d (FDRs). Note that a 777 will have one of the\nmore advanced versions.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_data_recorder\nWell this would seem to confirm what has been in the back of everyone\u2019s mind\nfor several days now\u2026\nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579434653903086282?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304914904579434653903086282.html\nAgain with the unnamed sources \ud83d\ude41\nIt isn\u2019t stated clearly, but it would seem to be referring to the ACARS stream\ngoing to Rolls Royce (though maybe Boeing was cc-ed as it were).\nI think they were supposed to refuel in Beijing prior to Europe. I believe\nmany airlines minimize the amount of fuel carried unnecessarily, so five hours\nis probably about how much range they had from Kuala Lumpur.\nMore importantly, what were the ACARS messages coming from the engines? They\nmay very well be minimal if there was nothing wrong with the engines. But\ncertainly, if confirmed the content of the messages matters less than how long\nthey were transmitted for.\nScratch that. Certain passengers were continuing to Europe. I am not sure I\nknow where the aircraft was supposed to fly to next. Does anyone know what the\nstandard service schedule for the plane was?\nDo you know if (for an usual flight with this configuration) Rolls-Royce and\nBoeing would both receive ACARS signals ?  \nIt seems the only information given by Boeing about the ACARS signals is from\nan un-named source (meaning there is no official communication from them).\nAre the ACARS signals not also received by the flying company ?\nI thought this was very crisply written:\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/03/malaysia_airways_flight_370_disappearance_is_unlike_anything_in_aviation.2.html\nCould an electrical fire do extensive damage to the plane, as well as perhaps\nmany people on board, making it unable to fly and damaging communications (if\npeople weren\u2019t already incapacitated), but Not cause the plane to explode.\nMeaning the fire could be extinguished after the debilitating damage was done,\nthe plane is essentially dead in the air and falling, but no explosion; it\nfalls pretty much in one piece. Could that be possible?\nBecause if what that oil rig worker saw was the plane, and if those satellite\nimages are the only debris, this plane must have came down essentially in\ntact. There has been no debris field which would\u2019ve made the plane easier to\nfind.\nForgot to add this in to the above post:\nOnly two causes could result in a flight losing communications so completely.\n\u201cYou can turn it off,\u201d says Sid McGuirk, professor of air traffic management\nat Embry-Riddle University, \u201cor you can have an electronics failure.\u201d\nHow to Disappear a Jetliner  \nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/03/malaysia_airways_flight_370_disappearance_is_unlike_anything_in_aviation.2.html\nI think it is plausible to have a fire that does sufficient damage to flight\ncontrol while not causing the plane to break apart mid-air.\nAlso, if it was suspected to be an electrical fire, I would imagine that with\nthe first signs of smoke they might pull all the breakers to non-essential\nelectrical components which would certainly include the passenger\ncommunication and entertainment systems.\nOK it\u2019s been daylight there for several hours and still no update on the\nsupposed wreckage. I expected to see Anderson Cooper out there in a tuna boat\nby now.\nYea, I mean what\u2019s going on? They know exactly the coordinates of where those\npieces of debris (or whatever they are) were on Sunday morning, not many hours\nafter the plane would\u2019ve went down; so if they plane is there it should be\nreasonable near to where those pieces were. Of course the pieces of whatever\nthey were have almost certainly floated far away by now.\nHello,\nCould it be possible that the plane was stolen and landed and hidden away\nsomewhere in Yemen or Somalia, or Pakistan and never be found again?\nIs there any possibility that we might never know what happened to the plane,\nor are we absolutely sure that we will find something in a couple of months?\nThank you!\nNot sure what the point of stealing a plane to hide it away would be. I am\nsure there is a secondary market for older jet parts, etc., but this is a 777.\nIt is possible that the jet will not be found quickly and possibly never. It\nis more probable that it, or confirmed parts of it, will be found eventually.\nmaybe point is to steal something or someone on board\ni think i just got you 20cents\nwhat do you think happened to Jet Patrick?\ni\u2019m wondering if the chinese-spotted debree is som other material. wouldn\u2019t\nthere be lots more color if it was the plane? all that luggage and seating,\netc. and why would the plane be in three white pieces?\nus sattelites did not pick up heat from explosion \u2014 so almost certaintly there\nwas no signiicant blast or explosion. so wouldn\u2019t the plane have remained\nwhole? do planes break on impact hitting the ocean? and do they float?\ni\u2019m less convinced. but would love to hear opinion from a plane expert which\nwas why I cam on here!!\ni don\u2019t see any google ads or id click 4 u.\nI hope some of you people are clicking on my Google ads!\nwho u responding 2? watt u talkin bout?\nhmmm\u2026. so someone who plans to blow up an airplane in flight relies on media\ninformation to learn how do to it? \u2026 hmmmm. You just saved billions of dollars\nin antiterrorist spending worldwide.\ni think it\u2019s it. until it\u2019s proved otherwise \u2014 & then i\u2019ll get back on my tech\nsecrets kinapping kick.\nand if it is proven other wise \u2014 boy is that gonna make everybodies heads\nspin.\nIs it possible the aircraft simply shut off the transponder and continued\nflight \u2018off the grid\u2019? I know it may be a stretch to believe a plane with\ninnocent passengers could be overtaken, but I find no media has speculated\nwhere a 777 could go with its mileage capacity and a off grid flight plan.\nWith the lack of published factual data, there may be other possibilities.\nWhat other locations within the range of the aircraft could the plane have\nlanded safely? I simply like looking at both sides of a coin, especially as so\nfew facts have been provided to media outlets, and what other global events\nare in progress where governments/agencies would need such a distraction?\nI dunno \u2014 seems about as plausable as the rest of this. but if somebody was\ntracking the metior wouldn\u2019t they have wondered what happend to it \u2014 if the\ntwo collided it meant the metior went off course too\nthat said \u2014 I\u2019d add metior to list of theories 4sure\ni was just looking around to what people are posting in respose to chinese\npics and post are pretty doulful, but maybe that\u2019s not credble doubt.\nIt\u2019s only doubtful to me in the sense that it\u2019s rather difficult to believe\nthat these large pieces debris weren\u2019t spotted during the 4 days of searching\nthe area, and area very near to where the plane was last seen on radar.\nRemember also that there was some debris spotted in the area very early on,\nbut that debris proved not to be part of the plane. Could this debris on the\nChinese satellite just be the same debris??\nPersonally though, as it\u2019s the best possibility so far, I\u2019m leaning about 65%\nin the direction that this satellite image could bring everyone close to the\nend of this apparently tragic story.\nI\u2019m a member of forum on a whole other topic, and this topic is being\ndiscussed there in a small degree. One guy just asked if what the oil worker\nsaw might not have been a meteor, because allegedly there had been one in the\narea around that time. And then I responded\u2026  \nSeriously?  \nWhat about this\u2026 Could a meteor fragment possibly even have hit the plane;\nimagine that.\nAssuming the Chinese sat photos do pan out to be debris from the aircraft\n(which is a big if at this point), it seems we would be back to a relatively\nshort period from last contact to crash. This might explain the lack of\ncommunication (as with Air France 447) \u2013 crew was too busy dealing with a\nsudden emergency.\nthe ocean is filled with so many things,\nanybody seen a sunken plane before??? is that what it looks like??\nwhy did the chinese wait so long to publish it?????????\nLooks as though perhaps the plane did turn slightly, but to the right rather\nthan to the left. Still hard to believe though that that general area wasn\u2019t\nalready searched thoroughly and any possible debris not spotted. Seems a bit\nincredible.\nthe pics really look like a big white plane \ud83d\ude41\nit is weird that everyobdy thought it turned the other way\u2026 but maybe that\nassumption was just an error and product on exhuberant journalism as much as\nanything else. and maybe we shoulda beliebed the Malaysians whe they said that\nother report was false.\nI WISH it was a kidnapping because that would be way more exciting and mean it\nwas likely the passengers were still alive.\nlooking at that pic :(((((\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be satellite images of the plane, fiona, at least not as\nfar as I understand, but rather of 3 sizable pieces of debris floating on the\nwater.\nwouldn\u2019t the debree add up to a plane?\nhmmm, i don\u2019t really get difference, thanks tho.\nbut they had the pics on sunday. surely they\u2019ve gone down for a closer look by\nnow.\nSince it\u2019s in the general area of where the plane was lost from radar, I just\nfind it incredible that this debris site wasn\u2019t found already by physical\nsearch other than by this satellite on Sunday.\nNow we just wait and see if this Chinese lead pans out. We should know\nsomething more definitive in the next 5 hours or so, I\u2019d think, since it\u2019s\ndark there now.\nYep. I\u2019ve got the report!\nLet\u2019s recap this.\nIF the plane indeed turned back and flew across Malaysia to the Strait of\nMalacca THEN:\n1\\. Penang International Airport at Georgetown is almost directly on that\npath. Why didn\u2019t the airport\u2019s primary radar pick up a big 777 airliner in\nit\u2019s vicinity?\n2\\. Why didn\u2019t the Mayasian Air Force try to scramble a jet or two in response\nto an unidentified aircraft entering it\u2019s airspace and obviously refusing to\ncommunicate? Or did they communicate, in which case they are hiding something.\n3\\. If the plane continued on and even crossed the Malacca Strait, then it\nwould be in Sumatra which is Indonesian territory and would have been picked\nup by Indonesian military radar as soon as it entered their airspace.\n4\\. Why aren\u2019t the media folk asking these questions? How dumb are they\nanyway?\nI can\u2019t believe both these militaries just gave a free pass to a large\nunidentified aircraft passing through their airspace and not communicating\neither! Either they are not telling something or they are amazingly\nincompetent!\nHere are the Chinese satellite photos just released:\n(scroll down)\nhttp://www.avherald.com/h?article=4710c69b\ngulp \u2014 sad. matches up with oil rig email. seems like the simplest most\nlogical. maybe that ties it up.\nI thought this was an insightful comment by the handle \u201caerobat\u201d over at\npprune, in response to a question about why pic 2 looks like the object is\nsubmerged:\n\u201cNot sitting on the bottom, but \u201cswamped\u201d like a boat \u2013 essentially floating\njust below the surface at neutral or near neutral buoyancy. Perhaps the\naircraft experienced minimal breakup at impact so much of the fuel may have\nremained in the tanks, thus acting as buoyancy compensator. The engines most\nlikely broke off rendering the remaining hull structure even closure to\nneutral buoyancy. An object that is neutrally buoyant can be driven well below\nthe surface by small vertical currents only to re-surface later when the\ncurrents change. This might explain the lack of a visual sighting on earlier\nsearches.\u201d\nhttp://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-\nlost-130.html\nApparently they\u2019re searching over land as well. So I go with the latter idea,\nthat they\u2019re not yet searching in the right place or that they\u2019ve only just\narrived to the right place. But then the question still remains, if the plane\ndidn\u2019t go down in the relative vicinity, and with all the countries in the\ngeneral area, didn\u2019t anyone anywhere notice the plane on their radar as it\npassed over their country? Perhaps some of these countries don\u2019t have radar,\nmaybe. And unless everyone on board were passed out, then why no attempt at\ncommunication?\npeople were protesting that the Malaysian gov were withholding info. at first\nI thought \u2014 misguided anger\u2013 \u2013 give em a break they just don\u2019t know and are\ntrying like the rest of us,\nbut now i wonder if those protesters were onto something\nGiven the state of the art of underwater surveillance (submarine detection)\nand the number of military vessels in the search, the inability to detect the\n\u201cping\u201d from the black box is significant. My opinion, as uniformed as anybody\nelse\u2019s, is that the odds are increasing that either the aircraft came down on\nland or the searchers are in completely the wrong place.\nI have a question. In the case of the Air Canada Flight 143 and from what I\nunderstand US Airways Flight 1549 both crashes resulted in a loss of power in\none way or another; however, both flights deployed the ram air turbine which\ngenerated power to provide critical flight instruments and control. IF the\nplan had turned back to malaysia and had they deployed the ram air turbine\ncould this not have provided enough power to turn on the transponder and\ncommunication equipment?\nway to debunk that theory , i\u2019m back on the kidnapping of 20 semiconductor\nemployees\nI started my participation here by taking the scenario that the plane had in\nfact been turned around and it was the plane seen flying over Malacca Strait.\nHowever, if that is the case, then again why did it again disappear from\nradar, military radar? One would think that (unless there was some \u201ccloaking\ndevice\u201d, you know, all scenarios\u2026, being turned on and off) that the plane\nmust have went down at that point.\nThe Malacca Strait is not that wide, although certainly possible, that if a\nplane exploded in the air no one would\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s also reported to be\none of the business water traffic areas in the world, and if an explosion\nwasn\u2019t seen then any debris from an explosion would almost certainly have been\nseen by now.\nif they couldn\u2019t track it for all that distance recrossing Malaysia before the\nmilitary spotted it \u2014 no reason to think it couldn\u2019t have continued on\nuntracked again.\nThat\u2019s a good question, fiona; however, there could be a number of variables\nthere. Malaysia isn\u2019t at war with anyone, and who knows how vigilant the\nMalaysian military are at watching radar for planes. Was the Military informed\nimmediately about the missing commercial jet? If not, perhaps the plane\nobserved on military radar was just by accident; or if the military was\ninformed, perhaps they weren\u2019t informed immediately and by the time they were\nit was then that the plane had already reached the Malacca Strait. And really,\ndo we know how long and at what distance the military were tracking this plane\nbefore it disappeared from their radar? Was it a matter of only a few minutes\nor as much 20 minutes or more??\nI think the plane must have flown undetected over Sumatra and off into the\nIndian Ocean, and then ran out of fuel and crashed. The pilots must have\nbecome incapacitated just as they got the plane turned around, and thus no\ndistress call. By my rough estimate, assuming the plane had enough of fuel to\ngo a couple hundred miles beyond Beijing, from where it turned back, it would\nhave crashed just southeast of Diego Garcia Island in the Chagos Archipelago.\nIf the plane was able to maintain altitude, and there\u2019s little reason why not\nusing this scenario, then I figure a bit further than he Chagos Archipelago,\nsince I believe these flights carry a bit more fuel than is necessary just to\nget to their destination, in case there have to be last minute detour. I\u2019d say\nsomewhere between Chagos and Mauritius.\nSuppose that the plane indeed crossed the Malacca strait and then also crossed\nSumatra. Well, Sumatra is Indonesian territory \u2013 if it entered Indonesian\nairspace, then shouldn\u2019t it have been picked up by Indonesian military radar?\nThis whole thing is not making sense.\nFirst, the Malaysian Air Force detects an unidentified flying object that\nenters Malaysian airspace and does absolutely nothing other than track it. No\nfighter jets to intercept it, nothing. Then, this plane supposedly goes on to\ncross the Malacca strait and enters Indonesian airspace and the Indonesian Air\nForce also neither detects it, nor does anything.\nHow can this be? Indonesia and Malaysia between them possess F-16, Sukhoi and\ntop of the line MiG aircraft. Indonesia has an airbase on Sumatra island\ncalled Pekanbaru.\nWhat does it mean that Malaysia cannot decide for sure if the blip on it\u2019s\nscreen was MH370 or something else? Every type of aircraft has a distinct\nradar signature and they should not have had any problem identifying it as a\nBoeing 777. Nor would the Indonesian Air Force.\nSo what information are these people hiding?\nI am with you on this but heard on the news this morning that the best time\nfor a plane to disappear is at the point of transfer between air traffic\ncontrollers.Coincidence that there was a malfunction at this point?\nVietnam ATC asked another pilot in the area to make contact but there was an\namount of static and he said the co pilot seemed to be mumbling\u2026\u2026.\nPerhaps a bit further\u2026 I just used my thumb and forefinger on a globe in my\noffice to make the estimate. I\u2019m sure the authorities could pinpoint it much\nbetter knowing exactly how much fuel the plane was carrying upon takeoff and\nthe direction of it\u2019s path across the Malaysian peninsula. Also they could\nfurther focus on the less-travelled waters, outside of shipping lanes where\nsomeone would have seen the wreckage by now.\nFreescale Semiconductor  \ngoogle it,.\nI\u2019m down with the conspiracy theory. apparently 20 employees of a company\ndeveloping military cloaking devices for planes were on the flight. maybe they\nwere testing or proving their wares. maybe they were selling to a country that\nwould be interested in buying. what better way to make the sale \u2014 then to\nconfound the world on their way over there.\nIt all sounds exotic and interesting, fiona, but greatly illogical. So Ok, we\ngo on the assumption that such technology was developed; 1st, why use a\ncommercial flight to demonstrate it? 2nd, cloaking the plane shouldn\u2019t make it\nunflyable. 3rd, if cloaking would also make it impossible to communicate in\nany means with the ground, one would then imagine that the pilots would return\nto KL and circle around until they saw a runaway available to land on. 4th,\nwhy would those cloaking the plane endanger their own lives? Of course, maybe\nthey cloaked the plane and then couldn\u2019t uncloak it. 5th, so OK, the plane was\ncloaked and then flown to the destination where the buyers are for the\ntechnology\u2026 But again, why use a commercial passenger plane for such a test\nrun???\nI\u2019m adjusting my theory as I read up more on this semicondoctor place and\nother theories posted on line about it.\nI don\u2019t think they cloaked the plane \u2014 I don\u2019t think they were the ones who\n\u201cdid it\u201d think they were the target and they were kidnapped. I think the plane\nwas hijacked for the purpose of kidnapping these 20 semiconducter employees. I\nthink a country \u2014 first guess Iran \u2013 but I dunno \u2014 wanted their knowledge and\ntheir technology.\nI don\u2019t think the plane crashed \u2013 I think it was landed somewhere and those\nemployees were transported to the country of interest. I don\u2019t know wht else\nin regards to other passengers. But I don\u2019t think the plane crashed.\ndon\u2019t have much evidence but that\u2019s my current theory, \u2014 I think it\u2019s LESS\nCRAZY than some 20 people on board had such desireable info in their heads \u2013\nfor international wafare \u2014 and that ithey are NOT related to the plane\nvanishing.\nThe following taken from:  \nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/the-botched-hunt-for-\nmalaysian-airlines-flight-370.html\n[Quote]If it is true that the 777 headed off into the vastness of the Andaman\nSea toward India, no longer able to relay its position, it could eerily have\nechoes of what happened over the Mediterranean in 2005. A Boeing 737 of Helios\nAirways flying from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens suffered what was called an\nuncontrolled decompression, due to a mistake made by the crew to the cabin\npressurization settings after a door seal had been affected by freezing\ntemperatures. Oxygen gradually leaked from the airplane and as a result the\npassengers and crew were rendered unconscious. The 737 flew on for three hours\nuntil it ran out of fuel and crashed into a mountain in Greece.[/Quote]\nCould it then not be calculated, as fiona was suggesting, based on the last\ndirection the plane was heading, and how long the fuel would last, as to\nroughly where the plane would\u2019ve ran out of fuel and went down?\nWe could be looking for a crash site somewhere in the middle of the Indian\nOcean, perhaps somewhere as distant as Mauritius.\nThe trajectory shown on the maps we\u2019ve seen online doesn\u2019t suggest the\ndirection of \u201cIndia\u201d to me, but more so Madagascar. Besides, if it were in the\ndirection of India, and it were able to maintain it\u2019s altitude, it would then\nlikely have gone down at the southern end of the Arabian Sea, perhaps almost\nreaching Somalia.\ninteresting aboit helios\nAccording to information presented on Discovery about the plane that crash\nlanded on Canadian drag strip the Ram Air thing didn\u2019t provide power to the\ntransponder????\nAny more indepth information on the previous post about the disruption in NOAA\nbuoys near Smith Island (Andian Sea)?\nOk, getting off track here with my original objective,\u2026 it\u2019s really easy to\nget distracted, I know\u2026 There seems to be so many possibilities, but\ncontinually mixing various things together just doesn\u2019t address any one thing\ndirectly. If we take one specific scenario and analyze it, then perhaps it\ncould be one idea that either has potential or could be eliminated. But we\u2019d\nhave to focus on a specific scenario\u2026\nSo again, if the plane did turn, and it was the plane flying over Malacca\nStrait, and if the direction was a conscious decision, and there had been time\nto send some sorts of message between the time of turning around and then\nlater being spotted over the Strait, then Why, why in that specific direction,\nand why no communication whatsoever? All just by chance???\ni would say absolutely not just by chance. if they were flying as they were\nintentionally than there was an intenional reason behind not communicating\nbut i\u2019ve seen here people say communication is third priority in an emergency\nand communication takes a lot of effort so maybe even over that hour there\ndidn\u2019t seem to be time.\nI feel like there would have been \u2014 over an hour \u2014 if they had wanted to /been\nfree to. but that\u2019s for an experienced pilot to weigh in on\nJust a left turn from the most recent comments\u2026.

But it is another\ncreative idea for gathering info (albeit from \u201cregular citizens\u201d).

The answers are out there \u2014\nneed to ask the right questions. (Of which I have long ago exhausted).\nThere are theories about terrorist, suicide, mechanical malfunction, pilot\nerror, etc\u2026. But what about sabotage?\nI\u2019d venture to say it\u2019s not possible \u2014 that none of those 200+ passenger\nattempted to message at any time if the flight was fine until it lost contact.\nI think the chances of that being the case are so slim that saying it is\npossible is statistically outlandish. IMO\nif they did not message I think it means something was stopping them from\ndoing it.\nAnd where exactly are the cell sites that would relay these messages?\nsuper strange \u2014 esp if nobody messaged even from beginning of take off!!!!!\nkinda throws every theory out window\u2026\nsudden mechanical failure would have allowed communication up until then\nhijacking would have inspired at lease some rogue desperate messaging\n\u2014\u2014- I think there\u2019s GOT to be some messages at least from very early on, but\nthey aren\u2019t being published? somebody with access needs to confirm if or if\nnot there was any messaging at all. that would give a lot of info.\nYes\u2026  \nWith a loss of cabin pressure, and the existence of the oxygen masks, one\nwould think that some people would still have the ability and time to send\nmessages, whether it be the pilots of some of the passengers. It could\u2019ve been\na slow loss that no one took notice of, but anyone awake, and trying to stay\nawake, the pilots for instance, are going to notice if they\u2019re slowly feeling\nthat they\u2019re losing consciousness, I would think,\u2026 and then put on their\noxygen mask and try to figure out what\u2019s happening.\nI would be thinking as with most airlines you are required to have your phone\nin flight mode. I know some flights in the USA now that you can get internet\naccess but it is not all over the world as of yet.\nI\u2019ve never fallen asleep rt off getting on plane. I know some do \u2014 but some\ndon\u2019t. there\u2019s GOT to be some history of passengers messaging people on land\nin the begining of the flight. and at some point it stopped. where is that\ninformation?\nAww, excellent question. Yes, of all the passengers and all of today\u2019s\ncommunication networks, you\u2019d think that some people must of been\ncommunicating with people on the ground. But still, after an hour into the\nflight, at 1:30am, it\u2019s possible that no one was communicating with anyone on\nthe ground at that time; it\u2019s possible.\nSorry to all that I haven\u2019t been clicking on the \u201creply\u201d button but rather\nhave just been posting, when some or most of my posts have been \u201creplies\u201d. I\u2019m\nlearning. \ud83d\ude09\n@ ThoughtfulGuy, Do you think that the area in the general vicinity of where\nthe plane was last seen on radar at 1:30 has likely been searched enough\nalready to at least speculate that there\u2019s no evidence that the plane went\ndown directly in that area?  \nOf course the plane could still be underwater in the Gulf of Thailand, but as\nof yet there simply hasn\u2019t been any debris found there. I guess it\u2019s possible\nthat the plane could\u2019ve landed on the water in tact and then sank, not\nspreading debris; but the waters there are fairly shallow and it shouldn\u2019t be\ntoo difficult to find the plane. However, I do imagine that it\u2019s now so easy\nto see a plane lying 50 meters below the surface. But then again, still\nfollowing this scenario, if the pilots were somehow able to land the plane on\nthe water and then it sank, that still should\u2019ve allowed time for some kind of\ncommunication to be made, even by cell-phone if other communications were out.\nHave you flown, fiona? Of course there are the oxygen masks which are supposed\nto immediately drop from above each passenger\u2019s seat (as well as with the\npilots and crew).\nBut again, back to my first question: IF the plane did make that turn and fly\nin the direction that took it over Malacca Strait, then why, why that\nparticular direction? Just accidental or by chance that it went in that\ndirection?\ni\u2019ve flown as a passenger plenty of times. that\u2019s it. no real aviation\nknowlegde. just very interested in the mystery. that\u2019s why I got on here \u2013 to\nsee what people with aviation expertise were saying.\nto try to answer your question \u2014\nwhy did they turn around \u2014\nmaybe \u2014 it was the initial instinct to try to return to the take off airport\nsince it was far closer than destination. and the impitus was mechanical\ntrouble or other physical emergency with the plane. however \u2014 there was not\nenough controll to get to the airport so instead the tried for the softest\nstraight decent they could arrange given limited control. or maybe they lost\ncontrol even of consciousness \u2014 passed out, etc \u2014 and had started to aim back\nfor the airport but within moments were unable to do more and the plane\ncontinued based on very last incomplete \u201cflying\u201d of pilot, etc.\neither that \u2014 or somebody wanted to duck under radar and fly to a foreign\ncountry to the west or north west, etc.\nthose are my two guesses. i was leaning toward the latter then got on here any\npeople were talking about how loss of cabin pressure could lead to drifting on\nautopilor for a long time with everybody on the plane asleep and I started\nleaning toward the former. \u2014 kind of like reaching for the way out in your\nlast breaths but you can\u2019t get there before you collapse. \u2014 ugh \u2014 that\u2019s\nmorbid \ud83d\ude41 it\u2019s just a guess.\nBoth reasonable possibilities. Though, for the loss of cabin pressure idea,\none would still have to ask why, what caused it? And wouldn\u2019t there be enough\noxygen stored on board to at least keep the pilots conscious for several hours\nin case of something that caused a loss of cabin pressure?\nBut then again, what if the loss of cabin pressure was something directly\neffecting the cockpit? But what could such a thing be at that altitude, which\nis supposed to be the safest part of the flight.\nAnd yes, it\u2019s logical that they would\u2019ve turned back for KL if there were a\nproblem, but again, why wasn\u2019t there some kind of communication if there was\ntime to give communication?\nOk, here\u2019s another idea\u2026 rather than a loss of cabin pressure, what if some\nsort of gas was released through the air vents and either slowly killed\neveryone on board or at least put them all to sleep?\nAnybody have any insight into the Malaysian government\u2019s behavior? They\u2019ve\nbeen hedging all over the place about whether they tracked the plane or not.\nPresently they are not confirming the revised course but still searching in\nareas that match the claims of the unnamed sources. It has gotten so bad that\nVietnam is curtailing their search efforts because they don\u2019t feel they are\ngetting useful information. Similarly there is a crowd-sourcing effort to\nreview high-res satellite images from a company in Denver; that effort would\nsurely benefit from some official best guesses being put forth by those with\nthe flight data.\nA second unrelated question. I assume it would be the case that either the\npilots or the crew can shut off the passenger communication systems easily?\nCertainly most of the passengers would likely have been sleeping. It was a\nnight flight, it left at 12:20am, I believe, and at the time of it being last\nseen on radar, at 1:30am roughly, most passengers may well have went to sleep.\nCertainly there would\u2019ve been some awake, but unless there was some abrupt\nmovement or sound coming from the plane, a gentle altering of the flight\u2019s\ndirection and/or altitude may well have not been noticed by any passengers who\nwere awake, again especially at that time of night and at high altitude.\nif there is loss of breathable air \u2014 what is protocol?\nPilots and crew put on oxygen masks. Crew makes sure all passengers have masks\non. Plane needs to descend somewhat quickly to a breathable altitude,\ntypically 10k ft (at least on older planes, there\u2019s limited oxygen for the\npassengers, maybe 20 minutes \u2013 the pilots have access to much more). Assuming\nno other issues, the plane will likely be diverted and land without incident\nWell yes, fiona, if I may be so direct, that\u2019s the $1000 question, Where would\nit have crashed, landed, or entered the water? But I\u2019d like to try to focus on\nsome possible answers as to Why, or How? Regardless if the pilots were unable\nto control the plane, if it didn\u2019t fall from the sky in a catastrophic\nmalfunction, in which the pilots would\u2019ve been frantically trying to get\ncontrol of the plane, then there would still have been means for the pilots or\npeople on board to communicate with someone on the ground. Why was there no\nsuch communication?\nHi Pelegrin. you can be direct.\nI\u2019m no pilot \u2014 so I don\u2019t know but\ncan\u2019t aviators calculate an answer to that $$ question?\nthey\u2019ve got two points to utalize \u2014 the point at which the plane first changed\ncourse and the point at which it was last tracked by military \u2014 can\u2019t they\ndraw a straight between those two points \u2014 take weather patterns into account\n\u2014 trajectory, incline, all that \u2014 and make a very educated guess as to where\nthat line would touch ground?\nSorry, fiona, I missed that reply of yours. Well yes, of course they can plot\nthat trajectory. The question though would first be: Why did the plane then\ndisappear from the military radar over Malacca Strait? One logical answer\nwould be that it finally went down there or exploded there, or something of\nthat nature. Then the area they have to search is quite specific, in a\nrelative sense. If the plane continued on that path, well as you say, you just\ndraw a line and continue searching along that line. But that relates again to\nmy first question here: Why that direction?\nwere any of the passengers communicating at any time during the flight?? seems\nlike there\u2019s gotta be messages sent at least during first hour of normal\nflight \u2014 if not what does that mean???\nassuming the pilots were nolonger making mechanical decisions \u2013 where would\nthe plane have landed/ crashed/ or entered water if it stayed the precise\ncourse it was on when last (supposedely) observed by Malaysian military?\nFor instance, if the plane did in fact make the turn and it was the plane\nspotted by Malaysia military radar over the Malacca Strait, then Why? What are\nthe possible reasons why the plane would\u2019ve been heading in that particular\ndirection, and apparently at an altitude just sufficiently low enough not to\nbe detected by commercial airline radar?\nI\u2019d like to ask some speculative questions in regards to the various\npossibilities that have been put forward about the missing plane and its\npassengers. Principally, taking different particular scenarios and asking,\nWhy? or How?\nSeveral things come into play here \u2026esp. since the bulk of the passengers on\nthe plane were from China\u2026.if they (Malaysia) claim now that they did NOT\ntrack the plane the competence of the ATC controllers and Malaysian Military\ncome into question to the world\u2026.esp to China\u2026.if they say they DID track it\nfor about an hour or 500 miles then the world wants to know why no action was\ntaken and if there was action taken why would Malaysia not admit to it?  \nPolitical nightmare no matter which way they turn now.\nI don\u2019t see why the primary radar at Georgetown (Penang International Airport)\ndid not pick up this plane if it went back over Malaysia as the military radar\nseems to be indicating.\nIf you draw a straight line between the last known location in the gulf of\nThailand and the island of Pulau Perak where the military radar lost contact \u2013\nthen you see that the plane must have passed within a few miles of Georgetown.\nEither the Malaysian government is hiding something or they are completely\nincompetent!\nHere is something that I have been thinking from the very start of this\ndisaster. Lets take into consideration for a moment the remote poss. that\n(Post 9/11/01) once a plane has lost communication with ATC and the\ntransponder is switched off things change very rapidly as to response and\nhandling of the situation. The Malaysian military clearly states the plane\nlost contact with ATC Radar and was still tracked by the military radar system\nfor at least 500 miles\u2026..assuming the plane was full of fuel it was within\nrange of a LOT of targets that would make it in the best interests of the\nMalaysian Military to do whatever it had to do to assure the safety of those\ntargets should the plane no longer be in control of the flight crew. I know\nthat there have been NO statements made to infer in any way that the military\nhad attempted to contact the plane during that 500 miles\u2026.but come now\u2026.are we\nso naive as to think that in today\u2019s world that this wasn\u2019t done? That they\nmade no attempt to contact that plane whatsoever\u2026.once that plane popped off\nof ATC radar and contact was lost with it from the ground crew rest assured\nthe military was contacted in minutes\u2026.at this point the military has already\nstated they continued to track the plane for 500 miles\u2026.. ok do the math here\n400mph and they tracked the plane for 500 miles????? No contact full of fuel\nno known intentions or destination????? What would the US Military do in this\ncase? I think the answer here is obvious.\nAuthorities are now denying they tracked the plane. It\u2019s an informational\nmess.\nLike you say the answer is obvious.\nThere is something the military are not telling us.\n[\u2026] According to a Wall Street Journal analytical piece by Daniel Michaels and\nJohn Ostrower on March 11, the search for #370 could be further hampered by\nthe fact that the region it was traversing is one of the busiest on the\nplanet: Southeast Asia. Moreover, according to Golson, radar isn\u2019t good enough\nafter the plane\u2019s farther than about 200 km from the nearest control tower,\nwhile precise GPS locations aren\u2019t relayed continuously by the pilots to air-\ntraffic controllers\u2014this is why we rely on a \u2018last known location\u2019, not a\ndefinitive \u2018last location\u2019. At the same time, controllers don\u2019t panic when\npilots don\u2019t ping back frequently because, according to pilot Patrick Smith\u2019s\nblog: [\u2026]\nDunno about that \u2026 Bob Woodruff claims to have contacted the gent\u2019s employer\nand verified the email.\nOf course he could have seen something else, but there\u2019s no indication of a\nhoax yet. Time will tell.\nHere is a possible scenario to what happened to Malaysian flight 370.  \nWhat if, either by remote control flight takeover, or suicide hijackers, or\nmad pilot, the plane went up, not down.  \nHas it ever been attempted to take a 777 passenger jet above the atmosphere,\nthrough the stratosphere, and into outer space?  \nCould this plane be floating above the earth right now?\nMalaysian Airways say this on their website:  \nStay connected  \nCommunicate with loved ones or workmates via calls or text messages using your\nseat entertainment controller that also works as an air-to-ground phone. You\ncan even send and receive emails mid-flight.\nIn addition would any of their planes have wifi meaning people could have been\non facebook, watsapp etc.\nEveryone could have called or txt from their seat controller so its even\nstranger no one did\u2026\nThe following email from an offshore oil rig worker is now in the hands of the\nthe Vietnamese authorities:\n\u2014\u2014\u2013  \nGentlemen,\nI believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines flight come down. The timing is right.\nI tried to contact Malaysian and Vietnamese officials days ago. But I do not\nknow if the message has been received.\nI am on the oil ring Songa-Mercur off the coast of Vung Tau.\nThe surface location of the observation is\nLat 08 22\u2019 30.20\u201d N\nLong 108 42.22.26\u201d E\nI observed (the plane?) burning at high altitude at a compass bearing of 265*\nto 275* from our surface location.\nIt is very difficult to judge the distance but I\u2019d say 50-70km along the\ncompass bearing 260* to 275*\nWhile I observed (the plane) it appeared to be in ONE piece.\nThe sea surface current at our location is 2-2.3 knots in the direction of\n225-230.\nThe wind direction has been E-ENE averaging 15-20 knots.\nFrom when I first saw the burning (plane?) until the flames went out (still at\nhigh altitude) was 10-15 seconds. There was no lateral movement so it was\neither coming toward our location stationary (falling) or going away from our\nlocation.\nThe general position of the observation was perpendicular / south west of the\nnormal flight paths (we see the con trails every day) and at a lower altitude\nthan the normal flight paths or on the compass bearing 265* to 275*\nintersecting the normal flight paths at normal altitude but further away.\nGood Luck\nMichael Jerome McKay\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nHe was on the rig Songa Mercur. Source:\nhttp://oilpro.com/post/3263/missing-malaysian-jet-mystery-solved-by-an-\noffshore-driller\nI\u2019ve read quite a few reports that this has been proven as a hoax email\u2026\nCould there have been a collision with an unknown flying object, e.g. a\nstealth aircraft, resulting in a catastrophic disintegration of the 777 while\nrendering the stealth object radar-visible but temporarily still navigable \u2014\nwith the westerly radar track corresponding to that object?\nI realize that sounds pretty implausible but so does every scenerio at this\npoint. Something caused the transponder to stop communicating; something\ncaused the crew not to be able to communicate. Is it even conceivable that a\n777 that loses electrical power to all means of communications still has\nelectrical power allows flight?\nThis is quite the mystery.\nI think there was a catastrophic failure of the air craft either the wing came\noff from damage to the wing previous and had not been repaired correctly,\nmaybe just dodgy maintenance.\nSorry folks. We really do not know. Let\u00b4s wait hoping that some more\ninformation will show up, especially where the 777 is.\nJust my opinion that just came in after read several aircraft accident:\nIncorrect setting on the cabin pressurization panel caused the pilots and\neveryone else on board to succumb to hypoxia. (like Helios flight 522)\nLast word from crew \u201calright good night\u201d, crew do not realize they are a bit\nbegan to lose consciousness, the crew just think the possibility of\ndrowsiness.  \nshortly before 17:30, the crew realized that something was wrong with the\ncabin pressure, No distress call because crew unable to speak then they do\nlast attempt to return to KL with re setting the autopilot (heading, but maybe\naltitude too), but before they finish set new heading, they pass out. then the\nplanes still fly towards strait of malacca and crash into ocean, or still fly\ntill the planes runs out of fuel, or crash on mountain around Sumatra.\nNote: according to passenger that have been fly with this planes, 1 month\nbefore accident, this planes have some problem with the rear door (the rear\ndoor can\u2019t be closed properly, so they cancel the flight). Decompression maybe\none of the possibility.\nIn Helios 522, there was some pretty serious misbehavior on the part of the\ncrew. The pilots would have had to ignore numerous alarms going off much prior\nto their hitting the hypoxia wall. And there immediate course correction would\nhave included a drop down to 10,000ft.\nA decompression event, assuming there is no other damage to the plane is\npretty easily dealt with, My mom and step-dad experienced one on a 737 size\njet (not sure it was specifically a 737) over California. There was a loud pop\nand then hiss and the masks dropped down. My mom, who admittedly is not the\nnervous type, said because the plane otherwise showed no signs of problems, it\nwas more surreal than anything. The pilots dropped down to 10k feet and,\nbecause it was a short flight, ended up landing at the destination airport\nanyway. My step-dad\u2019s ears were pretty screwed up for a long period after\nthough.\nThe five passengers who did not board the plane can be interrogated unless of\ncourse if they also have false documents and cannot be found. The second\nquestion is, do Malaysian military defences allow aircraft spotted on their\nradar without identification or a submitted flight plan to continue to fly\nacross the entire country in the middle of the night? Was there a plane flying\nwest or not. One thing for sure the plane did not go down where it has been\nsuggested. The sea is too shallow for it not to have been spotted by now.\nWhy doesn\u2019t a plane have an active gps tracking device (like you put on\nexpensive machinery on land in case they get stolen) ? Active gps tracking\ndevices are not expensive. I just don\u2019t get it?\nSorry to post again the news conference is bringing up interesting things\u2026\nfive passengers were no-shows at the airport and replaced with four standby\npassengers, consequently no baggage was off-loaded. This contrasts with the\nstatement a few days ago that five passengers who had checked in failed to\nboard and their baggage was off-loaded.\nThis is interesting (picture of life raft\nhttp://wstaw.org/m/2014/03/12/raft2_1.PNG )\nPORT DICKSON: A group of fishermen found a life raft bearing the word\n\u201cBoarding\u201d 10 nautical miles from Port Dickson town at 12pm yesterday.  \nOne of the fishermen, Azman Mohamad, 40, said they found the badly damaged\nraft floating and immediately notified the Kuala Linggi Malaysian Maritime\nEnforcement Agency (MMEA) in Malacca for assistance to lift the raft as it was\nvery heavy.  \n\u201cWe managed to tie it to our boat as we feared it would sink due to the\ndamages,\u201d he said.  \nWhen the MMEA boat arrived, the fishermen then handed over the raft into their\ncustody.  \nHowever, a Kuala Linggi MMEA spokesman said the raft sunk into the sea while\nthey were trying to bring the raft onboard.\nI still don\u2019t understand why the 5 people who checked their baggage in but\nnever got on the flight have not been mentioned again? It says their luggage\nwas removed but what if a bag wasn\u2019t\u2026Did they have bombs on their bags? If\npeople with fake passports can get on the plane isn\u2019t it likely that people\ncan check in luggage with something sinister in it. Even if they didn\u2019t do\nthis why go to the airport and check-in and NOT get on the plane. Did they\nknow something?\nAlso why was the picture of the 2 suspected stolen passport people doctored so\nthey both had the same legs? Very weird. Not even doctored in a good way a\nwhite line is clearly visible where they have done it. Is this relevant?\nProbably not but why do it\u2026just starts of conspiracy theories.\nI cannot believe that at this stage someone doesn\u2019t know something! I think\nsomeone knows where the plane is. Why is a source now saying the military\ndidn\u2019t track the plane for an additional hour? Like someone mentioned above if\nit was then an un-identified flying object why wasn\u2019t military jets deployed??\nNothing adds up and the silence from Malaysia speaks volumes\u2026..\nI think think it is pretty common for many flights to have people not board at\nthe last minute (often because they are late going from check-in to the gate).\nIf they don\u2019t board, the practice is to remove their luggage but it is also\nlikely the luggage was never loaded in the first place.\nIn any case, a mid-air explosion from a bomb in the cargo bay seems unlikely\nas the have found no debris along the fairly well-searched intended flight\npath. That\u2019s really the conundrum: no large debris field from a sudden massive\nstructural failure/explosion but no word from the cockpit after a less serious\nevent whereby the plane could keep flying for some time, the length of that\n\u201csome time\u201d being a very open question at this point.\nApparently they subsequently denied that any luggage was checked. The five\npeople simply did not show up for the flight at all, let alone check in and\ncheck their baggage, so the was no baggage \u201cto take off.\u201d\nAnd ask yourself, why would five people check in, check their luggage on\nboard, then not get on the plane? They would have all been identified (they\nwould have had to pick up their \u201coffloaded luggage\u201d and if this were so it\nwould be a highly suspicious event that would have received MUCH more scrutiny\nthan it did.)\nThe officials just \u201cmisannounced.\u201d They meant that five people didn\u2019t show up\nfor the flight, therefore their luggage was never on board the flight at all.\nIs my understanding.\nUnfortunately what I think you will find is that the integrity of the plane\nwas compromised leading to a high compression leak in the plane at 35000ft.\nThe transponder was turned off as the frantic pilots were trying to work out\nwhy the emergency oxygen wasn\u2019t working and lastly the plane descended as low\nas they could go in a last and final attempt to get some air as the poor souls\non board passed away the plane would pretty much fly itself until it ran out\nof fuel and crashed into some remote area of the world be that desert or\nocean; who knows. Sorry if my message is a bit graphic but hey this is what I\ncame up with after piecing the information together. Hopefully I am incorrect.\nthis is first explanation that made sense to me. with every alternate theory\nI\u2019ve wondered why nobody, pilot, crew or passengers so much as sent an sos\ntext during that hour following diversion. If they all passed out within\nmoments this would all make sense. i was wondering about poison gas \u2014 but loss\nof oxygen sounds less fantastic and all the more plausable.\nI hope you ARE correct considering the other more likely alternatives. If I\nwas on a plane that was going to crash for one reason or another I\u2019d rather be\nunconscious when it started going down.\n[\u2026] say that in the case of Flight 370, the transponder disappeared suddenly.\nThis could happen if there\u2019s a sudden loss of power or if it was switched off\n[\u2026]\nHi Patrick,\nI have my own speculation, but there are some airplane things that I need to\nask you to confirm mine.\nQ: If the plane is flying in the middle of Indian oceans, is the pilot able to\ncontact any land?\nQ: Is it possible for the autopilot to be malfunction without the pilot\nrealizing?\nNote: Damn great website you have here!! (I am a web developer)\nWhat are chances the pilots smoking cigarettes in cockpit could statr fire\nthat could explain all of this?\nEven if we smoke we always make sure that nonsmoking signs in the cabin are\nON\u2026 If we smoke we always have a glass with water where to put it off. And NO\nit is almost IMPOSSIBLE\u2026 Most fires on board are caused by electrical\nshortcuts or passengers smoking in the lavatories the last ones are more\noften; less dangerous but still.\nDid this flight have in-flight internet? If so was it turned on ? If yes then\nyou know exactly where the plane last was when the internet ended. Everyone\nwith \u201cfind my iPhone\u201d has the position in their icloud. Just get their login\nfrom their spouse or other means. In fact all the planes can be tracked this\nway if they have in-flight internet. Is in-flight internet cheaper than the\n\u201cexpensive\u201d streaming GPS systems recently discussed in the media?\nSmartphones and all other phones without signal are not of any use\u2026 Icloud and\nother applications will show the LAST position your phone registered while\nreceiving the signal and in the best case that might be 3000ft above the\nground while leaving the airport. At the open sea there is no signal at all.\nSatellite phones are other story\u2026 but nobody carries them anymore\u2026they are too\nexpensive; I bought my Iridium 9575 for about 1500$\u2026 and never used it. But\nstill when I fly in Cessna all by myself it gives me reinsurance that if I\nhave to do emergency landing somewhere unexpected I can always call for help.\nWith my flight schedule I can allow that to myself 2X a year\u2026 conclusion I\ndon\u2019t need it because my chances to win a lottery jack pot are higher than to\nhave a flight accident.\nI really don\u2019t get it anymore.  \nIt has been too long since MH370 disappeared and so far THERE IS NO EVIDENCE\nfor what so ever.  \nYes we can speculate as much as we want but the fact is something terrible has\nhappened and it is NOT A JOKE.  \nFor me the first question that I ask is why the transponder was off? Was it\njust a human reaction in stressed situation while trying to change a SQUAWK to\nemergency?  \nThere are different possibilities why the plane went down\u2026  \nOne of them is DECOMPRESSION caused by cracks in the fuselage or even rapid\ndecompression caused by explosion. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to brig such an\namount of whatever kind of explosive on board of the airplane that is able to\nexplode it in two pieces, but YES it could cause a crack or make a hole in the\nfuselage.  \nCurrent training standards (FAA, IATA) require all pilots who fly commercial\nairliners to complete annual rapid-decompression training in flight\nsimulators.  \nMost often, the first indication that something is wrong is the cabin altitude\nwarning horn blasting in the cockpit. Concurrently, the pilots experience\nabdominal pain and the feeling of having the wind knocked out of us, because\ntrapped gas expands with the loss of cabin pressure. Our first move is to don\nour oxygen masks, check the regulator to 100 percent oxygen and establish\ncommunication with the copilot or PIC. Depending on the altitude of the\naircraft and the fitness level of the pilots when the decompression occurs,\nthe UTC, or useful time of consciousness, can be as little as 5 to 10 seconds.  \nOnce the oxygen masks are in place, it is difficult to exhale as oxygen is\nforced into our lungs through automatic pressure breathing. So we reach for\nthe response checklist and begin the steps to safely descend the aircraft to a\nlower altitude where the crew and passengers can breathe without supplemental\noxygen.  \nWE ALL KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WHEN THIS HAPPENS\u2026 Even a flight attendant in\ntraining knows what\u2019s going on.  \nThe next step on the checklist is an immediate call to Air Traffic Control\n(ATC) explaining our situation and declaring an emergency, followed by\nchanging the transponder code (squawk) to 7700: the universal signal to ATC\nthat we are experiencing an emergency. Squawking the code allows expedited\nhandling in descents and vectors for the incident aircraft as we continue to\nthe nearest suitable airport.  \nPilots must handle all three of the steps required to end this scenario almost\nsimultaneously. We are aviating (flying the airplane), navigating (descending\nto our divert, or alternative landing point) and communicating (talking to ATC\nand to each other). A breakdown in any of these three tasks could be\ncatastrophic. When navigating, we need to know the precise height of the\nflyover terrain\u2014we don\u2019t always have the luxury of being able to see the\nground. A descent over an UNKNOWN territory directly to 10,000 feet could be\ndisastrous. What if due to some previous problems we\u2019ve lost a track of the\nplanned flight route? What if NAV and GPS are not functioning?  \nIf we still have everything under control and are conscious the next up on the\nchecklist would be that the pilot who\u2019s not flying makes a call to the flight\nattendants to discern the condition of the cabin and inquire about any\ninjuries. From the cockpit, we don\u2019t know the cause of the decompression or\nthe extent of damage to the aircraft. If we\u2019re lucky enough to see the size\nand location of the hole in the fuselage, we\u2019ll know more about the severity\nof our emergency. These details give pilots a good sense of the structural\nintegrity of the airframe and if further damage may be a concern. We don\u2019t\nwant to subject the damaged aircraft to any additional stresses (air load) as\nwe start a high-speed emergency descent.  \nWithout a pressurized cabin, our target level of altitude would be 10,000 feet\nbecause that is the highest altitude where we avoid significant oxygen\ndeprivation of the passengers and crew. Those little masks that drop down from\nabove can create chemically generated oxygen for only 10 to 20 minutes, so we\nmust descend quickly to a lower altitude. Ten thousand feet keeps the aircraft\nhigh enough to manage the fuel burn. At low altitudes, fuel burn can leave\nlong overwater flights (such as Los Angeles to Sydney) critically short of\nfuel, even during a divert to a known alternate field.  \nOnce the aircraft has descended to 10,000 feet, the passengers and crew can\nremove their masks and breathe the ambient air as we make our final descent\ninto the divert airfield. If the structural integrity of the aircraft has been\nassessed as sound, we\u2019ll make a normal approach and landing.\nThere\u2019s something they aren\u2019t telling us. How could a massive plane like a\nBoeing 777 disappear from radar. The black box wasn\u2019t found for years for the\nAir France flight off the coast of Africa. But they found wreckage within a\nweek or so. Two precedents ring over in my mind \u2013 China Airlines Flight 611\n(botched repairs many years earlier lead to mid air and sudden break up once\nreaching 35,000FT). And SilkAir Flight 185.  \nThough I honestly think if there was a bomb or the plane crashed they would\nhave found it by now. The plane went down very quickly and is out in the\nstraits out towards the Bay of Bengal.\nIn terms of previous repairs, the aircraft suffered damage to a wing tip about\na year and a half ago \u2013 probably not a factor.\nBut I do agree that both the airline and the Malaysian military could be more\nforthcoming with information.\nThere\u2019s a theory I\u2019ve been working on that connects a number of \u201ceyewitness\u201d\nreports to the military\u2019s initial radar sighting over the Straits of Malaca.\nI\u2019m taking it more seriously now that I\u2019ve stumbled across someone else with a\nsimilar take, who has fleshed it out in a very compelling way.\nhttp://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/535538-malaysian-airlines-mh370-contact-\nlost-104.html\n(Scroll down to the handle \u201conetrack\u201d)\nIt goes something like this:  \n1) The 370 suffered a massive decompression event at or near the 1:30 mark.  \n2) At that time, sounds of jet engines followed by an explosion were heard by\na group in Bandar Marang (on the North coast, and roughly in the designated\nflight path). The original account states confusion about where the explosion\nwas coming from\u2026the group thought it was from the sea (and initially feared a\ntsunami) yet later checked a wooded area.  \n3) The event knocked out communications on the aircraft.  \n4) The crew soon pivoted the aircraft back towards Malaysia.  \n5) And eventually blacked out.  \n6) But not before \u201cmumbling\u201d a response to the plane-to-plane call on\nemergency frequency at 1:40(?).  \n6) A fisherman near Khota Bharu had filed a report that he saw a \u201cwhite\nstreak\u201d that he took for a plane\u2026yet it had no red running lights and was\nflying the opposite direction that he was used to seeing (sorry, this was\nreported on the forum threads in the link above, and I\u2019ve lost the page #).\nThis is the point where the 370 crosses back over the peninsula.  \n7) The 370 keeps running towards Pulau where the military loses it.  \n8) And finally crashes into a mountainside in the remote northern end of\nSumatra (across the Straits).\nMaybe I\u2019m completely off..but I kind of like a theory that doesn\u2019t force me to\nbuy in to darker scenarios.\nSorry, there was no explosion, but a loud \u201cringing noise\u201d that sounded like a\njet fan.\nhttp://www.nst.com.my/latest/font-color-red-missing-mh370-font-loud-noise-\nreported-believed-linked-to-missing-plane-1.507926\nWell, given the peaks on Sumatra are only about 12K ft high and the\npossibility the auto-pilot was still engaged, under such a scenario, the plane\nvery well could have cleared the island as well.\nCould have, but obviously it would be in the crew\u2019s best interest to put the\nplane on a descent schedule so they can get to oxygenated air.\nBut \u201cask the pilot\u201d, because I\u2019m not one!\nWell from your earlier comment about the altitude over the Strait, that\u2019s only\na decent of 5K over an hour and certainly not down to an altitude with\nadequate oxygen concentration. And at that rate of descent, the plane easily\nclears Sumatra.\nI am perplexed why the Malaysian military hasn\u2019t officially confirmed the turn\nback route. I can\u2019t see the US military withholding such information in a\nsimilar circumstance especially as it will help in the more general search\neffort.\nIs is even possible to hear modern lower noise commercial jet engines (at\ncruise) at 35K feet from the ground? That\u2019s six and a half miles right there\nand the incident seems to have occurred dozens of miles from the coast.\nI am not trying to pick on you Zach but just wondering about the underlying\ndata you are using.\nNo, pick on me that\u2019s fine. I was just relying on the report filed by the\n\u201ceyewitness\u201d group on the beach, as reported by the local paper in the link\nabove.\nYOU WROTE: Unless there was an egregious security screening lapse, would it be\npossible for an individual, or two, to carry components of an explosive device\naboard without detection? Then, how much explosive power would be necessary to\nsubstantially damage a Boeing 777 in flight? Then, where would the device have\nto be placed for maximum effect? (bathroom?)\n\u2026 God bless you are a FORMER journalist.. What do you think? If this was\nreally done by terrorists, why should any media solve questions like the best\nplace to put a bomb? For the next terrorist? You wanna produce a Podcast for\nthem too? THINK \u2026\nNOAA data for 4 days ago shows a major disturbance of three of the buoys west\nof Smith island. Displacement of the first buoy shows approximately 1500 feet.\nWeather doesn\u2019t seem to have been severe enough to cause this type of\ndisturbance. Does anyone else have any data?\nSo cell phones keep ringing, so they cant be under water. And that would\nsuggest that the cell phones were turned back on (you know, since the stewards\nask people to turn them off during the flight), but how could they have been\nturned on and no one successfully sent out a message? A couple ideas: 1. if it\nwas a hijack, then the hijackers collected all the phones and put them in a\nbag and threw them in a place to shake off the trail (you can already see they\nthe hijackers have been one step ahead of the searchers). 2. if cell phones\nare active, and assuming NSA uses their Echeclon Tumbleweed technology to\nlisten in on and track the location of the phone, why havent the officials\ntold us any news about that.\nNo billibai, the cell phones ringing aren\u2019t significant as they can apparently\nappear to be ringing when they really aren\u2019t at all.\nCan any pilot look at the flight path that would have been necessary to go\nfrom where the air traffic control last spotted the transponder to where the\nmilitary radar last them up? Then, elaborate on the kind of skill necessary to\ndo that, whether it is 3,000 or 20,000 flight hours. For example, if it\nrequired some special skill then we can guess it was either pilot, or maybe\nthere was another pilot among the passengers that could hijack the plane\u2026\nAlthough I keep reading that the experienced piloy was a great guy and a good\nneighbor, the fact that he had a 777 flight simulator at home makes things\nmore suspicious. Might he have trained someone to be his co-pilot (and then\ntaken out that young guy)? Sorry, just speculating since it seems more and\nmore like a nefarious act.\nLooks like we now (according to CNN) have a different unnamed official denying\nreports of the other unnamed official who claimed the plane was tracked for an\nhour and ten minutes after changing course. The military really needs to make\nan official statement one way or the other.\nAs a private pilot, I\u2019ve had ATC tell me many times, \u201cNot receiving your\ntransponder. Please recycle and ident.\u201d It\u2019s common. BUT why isn\u2019t anyone\ndiscussing the fact that, even without an operating transponder, there still\nshould have been a PRIMARY radar return without the additional information,\ne.g. altitude and identification, that the transponder supplies? The blip on\nthe radar screen doesn\u2019t just disappear when the transponder quits working,\nunless the operator has the screen running on a mode that does not display\nprimary radar returns.\nGonna have to agree with this one too. There are so many things out of whack\nthat I\u2019m almost beginning to revert to my old Bermuda Triangle theory.\nEither someone is hiding something they don\u2019t want the world to know \u2014 like\nthe cockpit crew and the cabin crew were obviously fooling around when one of\nthem \u201cdived onto the throttle\u201d \u2014 in other words, something that would cast a\nhugely negative light on Malaysia (like the continued denials of the Egyptians\nto what to everyone else was a simple case of pilot suicide \u2014 there really was\nnot much argument there, but they protest to this day) or something completely\noff the wall, unexpected, and never encountered in aviation history happened \u2014\ntwo hundred coincidences just happening to fall in a neat row.\nWeirder stuff has happened that you just could not make up \u2014 flight attendants\nplummeting from 30,000 feet and surviving with no parachute and so on. And no\none has yet put DB Cooper to rest, either.\nNot saying aliens abducted anyone, just saying a series of monstrous\ncoincidences \u2014 which WILL be unearthed \u2014 will come to light eventually.\nMeanwhile, I, like everyone else, continue to comb the news for anything.\nBTW Patrick, your captchas are completely unintelligible. \u201cproducts terskag?\u201d\nIs IKEA\u2019s boss manufacturing them?\nI wish people would just say no distress signals were received. We don\u2019t know\nif they tried to send them or not, and may never.\nAny chance the plane is on the ground safely somewhere? Is it possible the\nplane turned, then dropped below radar, then turned a different direction to\nland at a later time flying below radar the whole time? It happened at night\nwhich reduces the chances of being seen as no one could see and people are\nsleeping. I heard there was 7 hours of fuel on board, that is enough to go a\nwhile! Maybe passengers are locked up and bad people have bad plans for the\nplane. This is all too odd, something does not add up here.\nNo, I can\u2019t imagine this. We\u2019re talking about a 777, not a Cessna 172. Plus\nthat\u2019s just too elaborate a scheme. Whatever happened, I suspect that in\nessence it was something very simple: hijacking, crew suicide, or catastrophic\nmechanical failure (electrical?) of some kind.\nP\nCould this theory carry any weight?: http://www.lowyat.net/2014/03/was-there-\na-problem-with-the-mh370-boeing-777-200-aircraft/\nAt least that theory is comforting in that the passengers likely would have\nhad little sense that anything was wrong before losing consciousness.\nI\u2019m sorry I posted the above somewhat hysterical post. As usual, it has the\nmundane markings of serial incompetence, lost opportunities, idiotic rivalries\nand just generally a line of stupid, goofy-beyond-belief errors that signals\nthe usual cause of anything \u201cmysterious\u201d that ever happens in this world.\nNo \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d anything here \u2014 just stupidity in vast amounts. Nothing\nto see here, folks, move along, move along.\nUmm, the person who said they were worried about their upcoming 10-hour flight\ninto the dark maw of Asian airspace . . . uh, yeah, you have a LOT to worry\nabout. Just nothing out of the ordinary.\nForget everything I said above. This is turning into typical Asian buffoonery.\nNot worth speculating when so many fools are stirring the pot.\nIs it possibile that an electrical fire (with smoke) started in E&E bay\n(directly below the cockpit). If you take the scenario to its normal\nprogression, it is possible that the Crew on MAS 370 could have taken a/c down\nto essential power or perhaps even only battery power (augmented by RAT). In\nan \u201call-electric\u201d jet, this could explain the loss of transponder signal and\nalso the turn-around. Swissair experienced similar situation and was in\nprocess of divert back to land when they went down. Although I hate\nspeculating, I keep thinking back to the EgyptAir 678 on July 29, 2011. Take a\nlook at accident pix of cockpit in final report on page 13. If this fire had\nhappened airborne it would have been catastrophic.\nIs someone hiding something?\nIf the plane turned around and headed back to Malaysia, with it\u2019s transponder\noff, then wouldn\u2019t that have put the Malaysian Air Force on alert? I mean,\nfrom their point of view, it would be some sort of unidentified aircraft\napproaching Malaysian airspace.\nLogically they would have first asked it to identify itself and if no answer,\nthen sent up some fighter planes to intercept it. So either the Malaysian Air\nForce was talking to the pilots during the last hour or fighters must have\nbeen sent to take a look.\nThey must know more about what happened than they are letting on\u2026\nGonna have to agree with this one\nMaybe I have overlooked something but did someone explained about those 5\npeople who did check in in Kuala Lumpur but finally did not get on board 777 ?\nAnd what about 19 people who try to reach their love ones after airplane\ndisappear and they claimed to get ringing tone but no answer ? What is that?\nRick..I so agree with you..we are in Michigan and NPR radio here reported that\n5 individuals actually checked in for that flight but never boarded..go find\nthe five and find out why??????????very weird\nAn ex-pilot just told Sky news he thinks the emergency air was deployed and\nfailed and everyone passed out then the plane crashed. \u2026..doesnt explain where\nthe plane is\nProfessional pilots: if electric power is lost, does the pilot lose the\ncapability to send a mayday signal?\nExactly, you are so right\nSo it did have ACARS, which transmitted in packets, up until the time the\ntransponder went off. So search & rescue does have \u201cpre-turnback\u201d vital signs\non the plane.\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25201-malaysian-plane-sent-out-engine-\ndata-before-vanishing.html#.Ux9wXCWYbIV\nThanks for finding this. I had been wondering. And yet this info seems to only\nbe the data that Rolls Royce collects. Presumably though, Boeing and Malaysia\nAirlines might have received some data as well?\nPatrick,\nI don\u2019t know if you are reading the comments, but in light of the new\ninformation about 370 apparently reversing course after the transponders were\nshut down (which as of this point has not been confirmed by a named source), I\nhave a few questions:\nAssuming a power failure and need for emergency landing, what would be a\nreason(s) for not continuing in the same basic direction for Ho Chi Mihn City?\nThe revised course, appears to maximize time over water. Would that be\npreferable in any way?\nAnd would this course then make sense to then follow the Malacca Strait back\nto Kuala Lumpur?\n[\u2026] at 3:30 on March 11, 2014 by Andrew Sullivan Pilot-blogger Patrick Smith\nis debunking speculation about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight\n370, which vanished from radar [\u2026]\nHe was mumbling: I am outa oxygen brah. Let me press this transponder switch\nto see if it will give us back some air.\nPerhaps a naive question, but here goes. During the 9/11 hijackings there were\npassengers who had time and presence of mind to use their cell phones. If this\nis a hijacking scenario, would there not be the same window of opportunity for\nthe Malaysia aircraft passengers to do the same. If however there was a\ncatastrophic and instant event obviously this would not be possible. Perhaps\nthe latter is more the case here?\nI would think that given their attitude and flight path, the likelihood of\ngetting a cell connection would be pretty remote. On the other hand, I think\npeople also used the Air Phones, which, if everything else was working, might\nstill be available if the airplane was set up for them.\nBut the same thing could be said for circumstance where there wasn\u2019t a\nhijacker \u2013 unless there were serious electrical issues. That no one heard from\nany passengers suggests their electronic access was gone too.\nThe last recorded altitude of 370 was 29,500ft (as it neared Pulau Perak).\nThat\u2019s lower than cruising, but still relatively high\u2026is there anything\nsignificant about flying at that altitude vs. the \u201cturnback\u201d altitude of\n35,000ft?\nCan someone tell me please why pilots even have the capability to turn off a\ntransponder? What is the purpose of such a switch being engineered? I don\u2019t\nunderstand why someone would ever need the capability of shutting off a plane\ntransponder.\nYou have to turn it off it it catchers fire or malfunctions. Why wouldn\u2019t you\nwant the ability to shut off a defective piece of equipment?\nFYI, here\u2019s why MH370 turned left after their flight attendant failed to\nsecure the door. Didn\u2019t I warn them?\nhttps://twitter.com/jasontaylor7/status/443432161987682304\nIf the transponder had been turned off, how did the military radar quoted as\ntracking the flight across to the Malacca Strait know it was the Malaysian\nflight? I suspect that this \u2018clue\u2019 is a mis-identification and there is no\nreal evidence that the flight made a big change in course.\nThe coincidence of ACARS messages ceasing when the plane\u2019s transponder signal\nvanished is highly significant in suggesting that a massive electrical failure\noccurred, taking out all communications channels. I would not have thought\nthat this was possible.\nYou don\u2019t need to have your transponder on to be seen by radar, as has been\ncovered over and over. However, you just appear as a \u201cPrimary Target\u201d with no\ndata next to it.\nChuck the transponder however confirms the target\u2019s identity, heading and\naltitude on a secondary radar display. Generally radar is only useful out to\nradar horizon and can\u2019t be relied upon much beyond 200 nautical miles. An\naircraft at 35,000ft can be seen by radar over 366nm distance, but radar\ncoverage is not used to control aircraft so distant.\nAlan you are right that massive electrical failure is more logical than\nhijacking or pilot suicide. Aircraft operating a faulty generator in parallel\nwith a healthy generator risk explosion and massive power surges from\nreversing the DC current direction if a diode burns out.\nNicholas \u2013 I am feeling even better about getting on my 10 hour flight on\nFriday after reading your post :/\nDon\u2019t be daft, air travel remains one of the safest modes of transport\ncurrently available. There\u2019s near to 50,000 flights every single year, the\nfact that one has mysteriously disappeared doesn\u2019t make any difference to your\nflight. You\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry.\nFifty thousand flights every DAY is more accurate.\nPatrick,\nMy overwhelming question is, even if a scenario that the transponder was\nturned off, or somehow all communications were somehow purposely disconnected,\nsurely the plane itself would not be completely invisible to any tracking\ndevice now everywhere in the modern world?\nIt seems inconceivable that if someone or some people had somehow managed to\ntake the plane out of its last confirmed location, there MUST be some trace \u2014\neven passengers\u2019 cellphones \u2014 don\u2019t they have automatic locators? If someone\nhad somehow managed to hijack the plane, there is NO WAY that all the\npassengers could be prevented from trying to use their phones. At least ONE\nwould have gotten through to somewhere.\nIf someone turned off the transponder and then immediately sent the plane into\na full nosedive with throttles on full, making the contact with the ground or\nsea so shattering that there would be very little left to find, STILL wouldn\u2019t\nthere have been something, ANYTHING that would have been tracking the plane?\nMilitary satellites \u2014 I can\u2019t go down a list because I have no idea what sorts\nof things are used to track aircraft \u2014 but for a plane to COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR\nwithout a single trace \u2014 it seems completely inconceivable to me.\njust read a very chilling report that the passengers\u2019 \u2014 and crews\u2019 \u2014\ncellphones CONTINUE TO RING but are not answered. What happens when one\u2019s cell\nphone is destroyed? It would continue to ring as normal, then go to voicemail?\nEven THAT seems inconceivable. n fact, everything about this case seems to be\nimpossible \u2014 everywhere you turn to look for some kind of explanation \u2014 and\nthese are, like you EXPERTS in all their fields \u2014 radar experts, military\nexperts, spy technologists \u2014 in short, every mind that can possibly be working\nto solve this has been completely stymied, and that is just \u2014 plainly \u2014\nINCOMPREHENSIBLE.\nIf it is actually possible for a large, modern airliner with all the latest\nthat technology can provide to vanish \u2014 literally DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY WITHOUT\nA SINGLE TRACE from a spot in earth\u2019s atmosphere 36,000 feet above the ground,\nWHY is it possible? WHY have the folks who build these things, sign off on\nthem, regulate them etc. etc. not built in some sort of INDESTRUCTIBLE system\nthat can not be tampered with from the plane itself that can at least tell the\nexperts whether or not the transponders went off because they were destroyed\nor whether they were switched off on purpose?\nThis is a monstrously worrisome turn of events that puts into question the\nENTIRE INTEGRITY of our commercial aviation system \u2014 it destroys any chance of\nthe credibility of the engineers, the technicians, the owners and operators of\ncivilian aircraft being trusted AT ALL.\nJust think about it. On a par with any other reality, it would be almost like\nsay, a village of 230 inhabitants situated in a major urban location were\nsomehow, overnight, in a few seconds, made to disappear with not a single\ntrace that they were ever even there to begin with \u2014 if you can believe THAT\nto be possible, then I suppose you can believe THIS to be possible.\nI hate to sound like a whack-job, but this is beginning to sound almost\nparanormal, almost Bermuda Triangle-like. Yeah I know, \u201cGet a life!\u201d but my\ngood God, does anyone else including all the finest minds that this earth has\nto offer have any other plausible explanation for this?\nAll I know is that it has severely shaken my confidence in the entire aviation\nindustry and the support network that props it up. There are some incredibly\nserious issues here that need to be dealt with on a MASSIVE SCALE involving\nALL the world\u2019s airlines and aircraft, literally and figuratively from the\nground up.\nThis points to some unbelievable black hole in the entire aviation system that\nneeds to be taken care of before ANYTHING ELSE like this happens again. To\nunderscore the seriousness of this, I would almost call for the immediate\ngrounding of all commercial aircraft, a la post 9/11, until this plane has\nbeen found.\nIf YOU, a top-grade, professional expert/specialist/technologist at the top of\nhis game cannot come up with anything that remotely sounds like a reasonable\nscenario \u2014 and I don\u2019t have to remind you that no one else has, either \u2014 then\nI would suggest taking severe and drastic measures within the entire industry.\nI don\u2019t care how many billions it would take. It is quite obvious that there\nare flaws in the system that are so incredibly serious \u2014 it reminds me of\nsomeone building a high-rise but forgetting to put in any elevators \u2014 that\neverything, from safety regulations to the way things work in the cockpit\n(video cameras that generate real-time images with sound to operations center,\nfor example, on all the time and unable to be switched off inside the plane,\nstreaming of realtime data from all FDRs to the ground throughout a plane\u2019s\nentire flight, *just for starters*) \u2014 all these things and more MUST be\nimplemented immediately no matter WHAT THE COST or \u201cprivacy issues\u201d of flight\ncrews \u2014 there should BE no privacy inside a cockpit of an aircraft holding\nhundreds of passengers, but I digress \u2014 all this must be done, and, like,\nstarting RIGHT THIS MINUTE.\nI don\u2019t care if this post makes me sound like an unreasonable panic-monger or\na nut job \u2014 the time has come to stop pussy-footing around with potentially\nmillions of innocent people\u2019s lives for the sake of the almighty dollar \u2014\nthings are only going to get MORE implicated, not less, with the travel sector\nnow expected to double in the next 20 years \u2014 or even more, and with the\naddition of hundreds, even thousands of new low-cost carriers with dodgy\nmanagement and maintenance a la Ryan Air coming into reality in the coming\nyears, this is a wake-up call of the utmost magnitude, quite possibly the most\nserious thing that has happened to commercial aviation since the first\npassenger plane left the ground.\nI don\u2019t know about anyone else, but I am flabbergasted, shaken to the core and\nshaking my head in disbelief that this whole thing is unfolding the way it is.\nAccuse me of anything you wish, even the most jaded and skeptical among you\nmust admit that this is a situation that must NEVER be allowed to happen\nagain.\nNicholas Robinson says:\n> It seems inconceivable that if someone or some people had somehow managed to\n> take the plane out of its last confirmed location, there MUST be some trace\n> \u2014 even passengers\u2019 cellphones \u2014 don\u2019t they have automatic locators?

Considering that\nin most cases this kind of device would only let searchers find the bodies of\npassengers sooner\u2026I mean\u2026.\n> does anyone else including all the finest minds that this earth has to offer\n> have any other plausible explanation for this?\nI would put some sort of crippling failure, bombing, and hijacking ahead of\nparanormal causes.\n> I don\u2019t care how many billions it would take.\nYou don\u2019t. Companies do.\nNicolas\u2013I think you have articulated the fear and shock many of us are\nfeeling, though there are answers for some of the points you make (the cell\nphones for instance) it is incredible the way this story is unfolding. I also\nfeel an urgency to see some sort of action taken to prevent this from\nhappening again. This event has shaken my confidence too, but I will continue\nto travel.\nNad\u2013Right there with you, I have some upcoming trips I\u2019m not super excited\nabout at this point (the flying part, that is).\nPatrick\u2013If there is any way you could do a dedicated post about flying over\noceans at night it would be greatly appreciated (I know I\u2019m not the only\none!). And thanks so much for updating. Your input is valued and helpful.\nhttp://postimg.org/image/uwmwxghch/ look here please, maybe is flight MH 370\nI agree, especially on #2. I think there would have been an enormous floating\ndebris field if the plane came apart at altitude.\nI wish they\u2019d tell us, \u201cEverything from ACARS was absolutely normal until the\nsignal vanished.\u201d That scrap of information alone allows you to eliminate some\npossibilities.\nWhat an awful thing, no matter what, and let us pray for restraint in the\npress.\nThe biggest mystery to me is the issue of ACARS. Very little has been said\nabout that. It appears that MH370 had the system and was transmitting, and\nthen suddenly stopped:\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-malaysia-airlines-\nidUSBREA291D520140310\nIn the early days after the Air France Flight 447 incident, ACARS was central\nto forming hypotheses about what happened. Over a couple of minutes ACARS\ntransmitted a string of failures and warnings. (Iced-over airspeed indicators\nprecipitated a disastrous crew response.)\nSpeculation on these things, at this stage, is to be despised, I know. But my\ntake is that you can draw just three conclusions: 1) Malaysia Airlines doesn\u2019t\nuse ACARS, or wasn\u2019t using it on this flight; 2) The airframe failure was so\ninstantaneous and catastrophic that transmissions were shut off like a light;\nor 3) Hijackers or saboteurs were able to turn off ACARS along with the\ntransponder.\nThis is a terrible tragedy. Many of us feel emotionally involved, and it would\nbe immensely helpful for Malaysia Airlines to comment on the status of MH370\u2019s\nACARS.\nJohn I think number 2) Instant and catastrophic airframe failure is now out of\nthe picture or extremely unlikely given the military satellite picked the\nplane up, it changed direction and flew anything from 100-500 more miles\nbefore it lost it again. Otherwise what are the chances of a hijacking taking\nplace then an airframe failure happening on the same flight. I mean we must be\ntalking 1 in 100000 billion or something. Unless of course during the\nhijacking explosives were set-off and caused an airframe failure..otherwise It\ncan now only be 1 of 3 things surely:\n1\\. Hijacking  \n2\\. Pilot / Co-pilot suicide  \n3\\. Loss of engines or electric and plane diverted to try and land although\ngiven the distance travelled I think origin airport was the same distance if\nnot closer and why wouldn\u2019t they call mayday?\nAre there any other circumstances that could have happened other that those 3\ngiven the plane changed course and continued to fly for at least another hour\nafter it was originally lost?\nNad.\nI think the most likely scenario is 3\u2026 the reverse of your post\u2026 There is no\nevidence for you 1 and 2\u2026. plenty of evidence for your 3\u2026\nI can\u2019t wait to board a Boeing 777-200 this Friday for a 10 hour flight :/\nGiven the military now say they tracked the plane for an additional hour and\nit changed course and flew at least 500 miles I am guessing it wasn\u2019t a\ncatastrophic mid air failure. This must mean the chances of it being a terror\n/ hijacking or pilot suicide have increased?\nI also see they have already started to discredit the pilot as a non-safety\nconscious guy who lets passengers into the cock-pit and posed for pictures in\nthere with them\u2026so the blame could be making its way to him v.soon!\nthe plane was flying at night \u2026 is it possible it flew straight into the water\nwith some kind of altitude malfunction ? WHat type of wreckage/debris would\nthat result in?\nIn case of an emergency, making a landing necessary, but not immediately\nnecessary \u2013 where would they have headed to? What would be the closest,\nsuitable airport known to them? I suppose they had no exact knowledge of the\nsurrounding land regarding alternative landing places apart from airports.\nSorry for my English.\nThey are seriously looking into the Malakka straight for a place to find the\nplane now ? That would be 2 hours in the opposite direction \u2013 does that make\nany sense to a pilot ?\nI flew as a First Officer with Patrick back in his days as Captain flying\nMetroliners out of Boston. As he said, it is aviate, navigate and then\ncommunicate. It is thus not necessarily to be expected that any communications\nwould be made before the emergency turned catastrophic.  \nLike Pat said, only in time will we hopefully learn what happened and can use\nthis knowledge to further aviation safety.  \nSad truth is we may never fully know what happened.\nThanks again Pat for your \u201cAsk the Pilot\u201d postings!\n[\u2026] Patrick Smith on Malaysia Airlines. At Ask The Pilot, airline pilot and\naviation writer Patrick Smith makes the frustrating but unavoidable point\nabout [\u2026]\nI fear the repeat of SilkAir 185 from December 1997. This was a flight from\nJakarta to Singapore. A flight time of just 75 minutes. Suicide was the most\nlikely scenario.the plane crashed into thick mud in a river half way. Only\nbecause Indonesia is densely inhabited, there were witnesses. Although the\nplane broke into pieces, all sank into the mud. AIRCRASH INVESTIGATION tv\nprogram looked at this and studied the black box outputs. Only manual setting\nof controls could have resulted in the flight path. Pilot had money problems,\nfrom playing the stock market, and had a double indemnity clause or somesuch\nif accidental death. Indonesia refused to sign off the cause as suicide as\nnational pride on their territory \u2026..Singapore, whose carrier this was, also\nleant heavily upon the investigation to prevent the cause being cited as\nsuicide. All switches etc manually turned off, cabin door locked\u2026.copilot, a\nbright ozzie young guy was asked to check on crew or to fetch some water\u2026then\ncockpit door closed from inside\u2026.sad. I knew people on this flight.\nFlew the route a few times in PMDG 777-200 on flight simulator. At 1 hour\nafter take-off the aircraft should be just south of Vietnam when supposedly\nradar contact was lost. Only way there is no debris field is transponder was\nturned off (by one of the pilots) and the survivor flew the plane in a\ndifferent direction and crashed it on purpose. No transponder, no\nidentification of aircraft.\nI\u2019m curious about your take on this article, Patrick.\nhttp://www.examiner.com/article/malaysia-jet-hidden-by-electronic-\nweaponry-20-ew-defense-linked-passengers\nhttp://www.flightradar24.com/38.06,-97/7#./7?&_suid=139451977358103042855783082931\nThis is the site for flight tracker. The one entry above shows the Maylaysia\nflight, altitude and everything\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5JpbZZKqxy0\nCheck this out from Flight Tracker.\n[\u2026] There have been a number of cases in which planes have fallen from the sky\n\u2014 from factors that include catastrophic failure and sabotage. As Patrick\nSmith, a commercial pilot who runs the popular Ask The Pilot website, writes:\n[\u2026]\nThe 777 is made of a composite material CFRB that should float, also it\ndeteriorates very fast with fire see shots of Asiana 214 before and after the\nfire.\nWikipedia\u2019s article on the Boeing 777 says:\n\u201cThe airframe incorporates the use of composite materials, which comprise nine\npercent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8X and\n777-9X).[148] Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor\nand rudder.\u201d\nSo the the other 93% of the 777-200ER\u2019s structure is not composite. The\nfuselage is conventional aluminum construction except for the cabin floor.\nAluminum structure does not do well in fires. If you\u2019ve ever put an empty\naluminum can in a campfire, you have a pretty good idea of why the Asiana\n777\u2019s fuselage was destroyed in the post-crash fire.\nThank you for this illuminating article. Given the lack of debris and lack of\ncommunication, what is the likelihood that this may be pilot suicide (like\nEgyptAir 990)?\nYou know as well as any of the rest of us does.  \nIt is one among dozens of possibilities.\nI understand why we should not expect to a hear a mayday or other call if the\npilots are in the throes of an emergency. Aviate, navigate, communicate \u2013\nunderstood.\nBut it seems like if MH 370 went down in the vicinity of where radar was lost,\ndebris would have been spotted by now.\nThat no debris has surfaced lends itself to the reasonable assumption that the\nplane flew for a significant period after the event causing the loss of radar\ncontact. Seemingly quite a significant period, at least based on where SAR has\nfound nothing and where the search has been expanded to.\nLet\u2019s assume this flying period was at least 15 minutes. I can understand no\nmayday or other communication in five minutes, but 15 or more?\nIt seems like the most likely explanation for a lack of communication during\nthat length of time is either that the pilots were incapacitated or all\ncommunications capabilities had failed.\nWhat would explain that? Which is to say, what would explain:\n1) Loss of radar contact,  \nfollowed by  \n2) significant flying time,  \nwith  \n3) no communications,  \nending in  \n4) a crash, ditch, or super secret landing\nTo me, and obviously this is pure speculation, but the most likely\nexplanations are:\n1) A fire that knocks out the transponder and comms (or the pilots) and\neventually brings the plane down  \n2) A highjacking.\nBut leaving my pure speculation to the side, given that the time between loss\nof radar and contact with the ground or ocean appears to have been far more\nsignificant than a few minutes, it seems very relevant that there was no\nmayday or communication.\nIn regards to an incapacitating fire, it\u2019s hard to forget the valiant efforts\nof First Officer Stefan Low (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Air_111 )\nAlthough that fire didn\u2019t impact communications, or the plane\u2019s position on\nHalifax radar.\nThere is a third option and that is oxygen and a lack thereof. There is\nprecedent for this happening with Helios 522.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Airways_Flight_522\nPossible, though i\u2019m not sure how probable.\nThis page has been more informative than any other I have read. Thank you!  \nI don\u2019t understand how the electronics/transponders/radars in planes work, or\nwhether it is possible for a plane to lose all it\u2019s electrical power and thus\nall communication, yet keep flying for over an hour.  \nHowever, I do know that mobile phones work fine from planes and that there\nwere about 160-180 of them on this flight.  \nIf all normal pilot communication was lost somehow, wouldn\u2019t someone have made\na phone call?  \nTo me, this indicates that either all the passengers were unconscious or dead\nat the time of the course change and loss of communication, or that they were\nprevented from using their phones.  \nI realise that the change of direction may not have been noticed by the\npassengers, but surely some of them were awake and using their phones at the\ntime?\nMobile phones only work in the vicinity of a radio tower. These radio towers\nhave a relatively short range, up to around 40 miles or so on flat terrain.\nThis flight was presumably hundreds of miles out to sea, where there are no\ncell towers. This is compounded by the fact that the plane was moving very\nfast and flying very high (35k ft). Nobody on board would have had service.\n[\u2026] There have been a number of cases in which planes have fallen from the sky\n\u2014 from factors that include catastrophic failure and sabotage. As Patrick\nSmith, a commercial pilot who runs the popular Ask The Pilot website, writes:\n[\u2026]\n[\u2026] Patrick Smith on Malaysia Airlines. At Ask The Pilot, airline pilot and\naviation writer Patrick Smith makes the frustrating but unavoidable point\nabout [\u2026]\n _you aviate, navigate, and communicate_\nWhere does get on oxygen fall?\nI notice the 777 has an outwardly opening cargo door.\nWhat if we had a United 811 like scenario.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_811\nIIRC the 777 will automatically compensate for an engine out \u2013 but does that\ntrigger the disconnect of the autopilot? I would assume it does\u2026. If not, it\nseems like a pilots could get preoccupied with a cascade of emergencies and\nnot get on oxygen and the aircraft would then try to fly itself until it ran\nout of gas.\nI\u2019d have to think an explosive decompression, followed by the #2 engine\ningesting the cargo door, would be an incredibly chaotic inflight emergency.\nIs it possible to manually turn off the ACARS system from the cockpit? This is\nthe system that sends limited flight data back to the airlines operations\ncenter. If this cannot be turned off manually from the cockpit, the fact that\nthe Malaysian Airlines VP of operations said the last info they had from the\nplane was that it was at 35,000 feet and not having any problems is very\nlikely the actual condition of the plane before all contact was lost. If this\ncannot be easily disabled, many of the hijack scenarios fall away.\nSimultaneously loss of all communications does not bode well.\n[\u2026] There have been a number of cases in which planes have fallen from the sky\n\u2014 from factors that include catastrophic failure and sabotage. As Patrick\nSmith, a commercial pilot who runs the popular Ask The Pilot website, writes:\n[\u2026]\nI have a hunch, that nobody I\u2019ve seen has brought up.\nComplete electrical failure. It has happened, United Airlines flight 854,\nalthough not in a fly-by-wire aircraft (767), and the plane landed safely. And\nthey has use of the battery, and of course since the engines were running fine\nthey had full flight control via the hydraulic system, where nothing was\nwrong. They also lost use of the radios.\nSo if the same thing happens in a 777, they have 30? minutes to land before\nthe battery runs dry and they completely lose the ability to control the\nplane. They might well have been too far from land to have a chance.  \nAnd if the battery goes, the plane would presumably be trimmed to fly straight\nand level, so it would continues flying almost straight and almost level,\nuntil fuel runs out, or more likely the plane slowly climbs and loses airspeed\nuntil it stalls and crashes into the sea/ground, or descends slowly until it\nhits something, or until something, perhaps sudden wind guest or turbulence,\nexceeds the passive stability of the airplane, and it rolls over and dives\ninto the sea/ground.\nIn any case, it could continue flying for quite some time, easily out of the\nsearch area. Possibly it did turn back toward land, but they didn\u2019t make it\nbefore the battery died?\nCan\u2019t believe that nobody on airliners,net has brought the possibility up.\nIf they lost engine 1 and 2 and the auxiliary power unit that would trigger\nthe automatic deployment of the ram air turbine.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_air_turbine\nThese are or seem to be the facts:\n1\\. American satellite indicates there was no explosion at high latitude\n2\\. The pilot(s) did not make any Mayday distress call\n3\\. Radar tracking indicates the plane appeared to have turned back. Some\nunconfirmed sources had shown on FB the police report lodged by two fishermen\ndeclaring that they have sighted a plane heading north at extremely low\naltitude at the time the plane had disappeared from the radar screen.\n4\\. Another pilot flying a Boeing 777 heading for Japan was requested by\nVietnam control tower to contact MH370 when the Vietnamese could not see the\nplane on their radar screen. The presumably Japanese pilot did manage to\nconnect with MH370, and he said he there were static interferences but he was\ncertain it was the co-pilot that was \u201cmumbling\u201d at the other end. Then he was\ndisconnected. But why was the co-pilot mumbling?\n5\\. The two passengers using Italian and Austrian passports were said to have\ninitially booked flights to Frankfurt and Amsterdam without making transit at\nBeijing. But they could not pick up their tickets on time. They then had to\nre-book a new flight i.e. this MH370 flight that was making a stop-over at\nBeijing. Therefore, if it is true they had no intention of stopping at\nBeijing, it would seem that they were more likely to be drug traffickers\nrather than terrorists, given the fact that Amsterdam is a notorious hub for\ndrug distribution.\nSo if it is true these passengers on faked passports were not terrorists and\nthere was no explosion, why did the plane quietly crash into the ocean?\n _But why was the co-pilot mumbling?_\nHypoxia?\nIn awe of the knowledge on this website, but Todd mentions something I was\nwondering about for a few days now, and the major media is not discussing, or\nI don\u2019t know really, but the authorities now seem to keep saying, the \u2018final\u2019\nwords of..the final words? The last words? I read some articles that said\nthere was a pilot, (who? which airline? aircraft? where?) who was asked to\ncontact MH370 and they got a response, but there was \u2018mumbling\u2019 and \u2018static\u2019?\nI am in no way an aviation professional, only an ordinary citizen who has the\ngreatest respect for those who take us and keep us in their care and safety so\nfar above the earth, but I heard this evening as well someone ask about the\ntime frame of when the final or last communication with pilots: well, the\n\u2018last\u2019 communication with the pilots would have been that communication that\nthe Viet Nam air traffic control asked to check on the MH370? Is that a true\nstatement, a true fact, at this point, there is so much out there about this\nand keeps changing, but I am a more vintage person, so maybe hard to keep\ntrack of all this, I don\u2019t know, maybe those are not facts, about that event,\nthe asking and the other pilot and the response, the mumbling response and so.\nTo me, ordinary person out here, wouldn\u2019t that really set things in motion to\ngo and find the plane?like right then? is that what happened?And if it didn\u2019t,\nwhy didn\u2019t it? I keep thinking back to that Payne Stewart incident: they sent\nmilitary planes to escort, as soon as they could tell there was some thing\nvery amiss, and also protect anyone else. So, I don\u2019t have an answer Todd, but\nfunny how this matter is not in the news, which is taken over now about the\nissues of the pilots and they might be bad guys and so forth. Hopefully this\nwill come to closure and soon for all those waiting for answers. And grieving\nfor their loved ones. Maybe we will hear more about the contact that was had\nby the \u2018other pilot\u2019 at request of the other country\u2019s air control. And what\nwas done after they got that message. To be sure, lots of very knowledgeable\nfolks here and maybe they can help more with this or dispel it. Thank you.\nAs to point 2\u2026 a lack of a mayday call is not at all unusual in air crashes.\nCommunicating with ATC is always secondary in an emergency.\nAs to point 3\u2026 we keep hearing about this \u201cturning back.\u201d Turned back to\nwhere? They were a long way from their departure airport. More likely, if the\ncrew was going to change course, they would be diverting to a closer suitable\nairport, not \u201cturning back.\u201d\nAs to point 4\u2026 Was it mumbling, or just typical radio distortion? (And why\nwould it have been the copilot, necessarily, and not the captain?)\nIs that you, Patrick? You said \u201ccopilot\u201d\u2026?!\nMore and more is obvious that something went wrong in the plain. How is\npossible that no one on plane call by mobile phone after plan was passing over\nthe land again on its direction west. Is it possible to track mobile phones on\nflight?\nWhat about the flight entertainment system it has a sat phone for use with a\ncredit card ? I believe it can be switched off in the galley and cockpit. We\nhave to assume it was .\nJust a thought\u2026\nAlmost any non-terrorist incident that would bearing down a 777 would invole\nmultiple points of failure in which the exact sequence of failure has a 1 in\n100,000,000 chance of occurring.. So, maybe we have a Hellios Airways like\nscenario?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Airways_Flight_522\nA pressurization problem coupled with a cabin pressure warning system failure?\nThat would explain why the wreckage is, thus far, so far from where they are\nlooking.\nTodd, I think you might be on the right track with a pressurization issue.\nPossibly the plane failed to pressurize as it gained altitude. The pilots\neither didn\u2019t get a pressurization warning or they chose to ignore it because\nthey suspected the indicator was malfunctioning. By the time they realised\nthere was actually a problem they would have been close to unconsciousness but\nwere able to turn the plane around but nothing much else.\nThis would explain no distress call and no debris in the initial search\nlocations because the plane came down on the west side of Malaysia. It also\ncoincides with the military radar returns.\nThis is doubtful. I read somewhere else (can\u2019t remember where) that the 777\nhas a much more modern system that would warn the pilots if the pressurisation\nwas off. Anyway it doesn\u2019t explain why the transponder suddenly turned off\u2026\n _Anyway it doesn\u2019t explain why the transponder suddenly turned off\u2026_\nWhere is the transponder control in relation to the cabin pressure control? I\nwould think the transponder is near the comm and the pressure is overhead\u2026 but\nif there were near each other\u2026\nAs to your point about the pressure warning system. Yes, it\u2019s state of the art\nas the 777 is a super reliable aircraft. As such, anything that brought it\ndown must have resulted from multiple extremly rare failures.\nI do agree with you guys that the transponder is the big mystery. Could a\npilot being starved of oxygen turn it off by mistake?\nTaken on its own merit, the transponder stopping suggests either a hijacking\nor explosion but there\u2019s no evidence for those. No debris anywhere near the\nplane\u2019s last known position and no public statements or demands from any\nterrorist organisation, and I presume publicity would have been the prime goal\nof any alleged bad guys.\nRegarding the Malaysian military denying the earlier radar reports, it might\nbe a case of them not wanting their neighbours to know what capabilities the\nradar has (or doesn\u2019t have).\nI still think the plane came down west, possibly far to the west, of Malaysia\nbut I suppose anything is possible.\nAnother point that may or may not end up being relevant in this case:\nThe \u2018black boxes\u2019 have audio locator beacons (i.e. they make a noise) which\nactivate after a crash, and last about 30 days on battery power. In a number\nof cases (e.g. Air France, Adam Air) recovery was much more difficult because\nthe beacons ran out of power before they could be recovered.\nWhy not change the design slightly, so that instead of pinging once every few\nminutes until the battery expires, have them ping less and less frequently as\ntime progresses? This would mean that even perhaps 12 months after the crash,\nthere would be occasional pings to listen for. With an onboard clock, the\ntiming of the ping could be predictable to searchers.\n[\u2026] There have been a number of cases in which planes have fallen from the sky\n\u2014 from factors that include catastrophic failure and sabotage.

You may\nfind this interview interesting. I have been compiling data on pilots passing-\nout in flight for the past 3 years. When I presented my data to a retired\nphysicist, he stated \u201cI would be much more concerned about planes starting to\nfall apart\u201d \u2013 Wigner Effect, from increased atmospheric radiation from the\nongoing Fukushima Accident. Wigner effect is the discomposition of metals and\ncomponents from neutron bombardment. This is what \u2018fries\u2019 robots working in\nhigh radiation areas.

I would love for you to one day do a post on\nflying over the ocean (esp. over-night flights), since this exact MH370\nscenario is the worst fear of many.\nThank you for weighing in, very interested in your input after we have more\ninformation.\nHere\u2019s an article in Popular Mechanics by Barbara Peterson that addresses\nseveral of our questions, and cites ATP in the process (by referring to her\nreferral, I\u2019ve just brought us fully into the internet age).\nhttp://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/aviation/crashes/malaysia-airline-\nflight-370-how-can-an-airliner-just-disappear-16578965\nSeems like it would be simple to make the black boxes capable of separating\nthemselves from the plane and floating.\nSince the black box is inside a massive pressurized steel canister weighing\nabout half a million pounds\u2026 and it\u2019s both inanimate and unable to think on\nits own\u2026 how exactly would it get out of the sinking plane to be able to float\nto the surface but still know to remain in the plane during normal ascents,\ndescents and cruising?\nEverything \u201cseems\u201d easy to the people sitting at home typing.\nThe Navy\u2019s P3 plane has a flight locator on the tail which automatically\nejects if the front of plane hits something\u2013think air bag, or if it is\nsubmerged in salt water. The locator then floats on the surface.  \nThe system seems a bit more troublesome than on other planes, but it works.\nIs it possible that the plane flying to way points might happen if the\nnavigation system rebooted itself and started flying a previous course\nprogramed in? Assuming the pilots were passed out from oxygen deprivation.\nCould the whole scenario happen from some electrical failure and/or software\nbugs and automatic responses from the plane\u2019s software.\nShut off cabin air packs, shut off alarms, shut off power to transponders,\nlocators, reboot the nav system, maintain erratic altitude? Seems\npossible\u2013just real unlikely.\nAlso usually radar gets altitude info from the transponders. I\u2019m guessing\nreports of the plane going to 45,000 ft. then down to 12,000 are based on\nsomething like angle over the horizon or something and may not be totally\naccurate.\nHello\nI just want to ask that how will a flight that is so big just dissapear. There\nis no contact, nothing. It\u2019s just PHOOFF and gone.\nOne more question. How do you know so much?\nIt seems like you\u2019d need a system that would \u201ceject\u201d the flight recorders in\nthe event of a crash, using explosives like a fighter jet\u2019s ejector seats. And\nyou\u2019d have to guarantee the explosives would not inadvertently go off under\nother circumstances and in such a way as to cause a safety hazard.\nI\u2019m not saying this is an impossible concept, but probably a difficult one,\nand also probably not one that airplane manufacturers want to spend the money\non, given the infrequency of plane crashes.\nHi Patrick! Congratulations on your exceptional work! I was just wondering if\nthese kind of accidents lead to a revision of the aircraft, in this case\n777-200ER if I\u2019m not mistaken, and if so, how long could Boeing take to issue\nany indication, should they discover structural issues that need to be fixed,\nparts to be replaced, or even if a recall would be necessary (I know it\u2019s\nquite extreme, but it has happened). The reason of my question being that\nthere are probably many (can\u2019t really tell exact figure) of those airliners\nflying at this very moment and I\u2019m not sure airlines will simply replace all\ntheir existing 777 scheduled flights with another airliner.  \nWell, congratulations once more!! Hope you\u2019ll enjoy the rest of your holiday\n=)  \nlucia\nAccording to a NOVA documentary on Air France 447, modern airliners are\nconstantly tracked by satellite, and data on aircraft systems are updated\nevery few minutes. This happens even when they are out of range of ground\nradar, and when no voice communications are made from the cockpit.  \nWas this the case with the Malaysian flight? If not, why not?  \nWould the sudden disappearance indicate a catastrophic failure with no\nwarning, like TWA 800?  \nThanks, Patrick, as always, for the professional perspective.  \nLink to NOVA program:  \nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/crash-flight-447.html\nI\u2019ve been wondering about this. I have seen no mention of this data stream in\nthe reporting at all. Even if it contains no other anomolies, it should tell\nus within a few minutes when communication systems failed, which is relevant\nto where to look.\nIs this engineering data stream optional and not implemented by Malaysia\nAirlines?\nUpdate:  \n\u201cMalaysia Airlines has confirmed its plane had a system called ACARS, or the\nAircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, which would also\nautomatically alert engineers at base of any mechanical failure.\u201d  \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/malaysia-airlines-plane-mystery-\ndisappear-off-radar\n\u201cThe Malaysian jet was equipped with ACARS but the airline has not yet said\nwhether any messages had been received.\u201d  \nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-can-mh370-disappear-in-the-ocean-\nit-s-not-hard-a-comparison-with-af447-case/article1-1193436.aspx?htsw0023\nI wondered about this as well. With the Air France flight, several messages\n(4, I believe) were sent by the plane with data and warnings just before it\ncrashed. Shouldn\u2019t there be similar data from MH 370? I did read that Rolls\nRoyce may have gotten some data from it, but I don\u2019t know if that source was\nreliable, and no mention was made of what information the data might contain.\nNew Developing story, Rolls Royce engines which send engine data every 30\nminutes actually were sending data for approx. 5 hours total, 4 hours after\nlast known good location. Google it for more info.\nAccording to what I have read Malaysian Airlines did not go for the optional\nBoeing, Rolls Royce and ACARS/TCARS monitoring systems. Meaning the airline\ndid not want to pay the extra bucks for these tracking and maintenance\noptions. Pretty much like a Lo-Jack or On Star for my Cadillac. I can go on\nOnStar at any time of the day or night, know where my car is Long and Latt and\nget engine tranny and electrical operating conditions for 100 bucks a year. To\ntrack and ping my cell phone to find out where it is or where it was when it\nwas last shutdown cost me 4 bucks a month.. I know this sounds condescending,\nbut these third world airline better get their crap together. It could have\nbeen suicide. Remember Egypt 990? Similar. But I am going with slow\ndecompression, hypoxia and death.\n-the writer is a private pilot and US Navy Vet with over 2000 hrs of FT\nWhat about the possibility of the plane being taken to a remote air strip\nafter a forceful take over and transponders being switched off?\nWhat about the possibility of crash landing in an abandoned strip of land?\nWhat about the doors not closing which lead to reduced cabin pressure like the\none that happened in A380 Landing in Azar Beijan.\nLanding (or even crash-landing) a 777 on \u201ca remote air strip\u201d in the middle of\nthe night?  \nAnd once you\u2019ve turned off the transponder, there\u2019s always primary radar.\nWhat was the mental & financial state of the pilot? Did he have debts?  \nWhy was transponder turned off at 35,000?  \nCould the plane then be flown below radar to North Korea?\ngood point! That happened to Flight 714 to Sydney.\nFlight 714 to Sydney? Are we talking Tintin here?\nYes, the case looks like similar to the Flight 714 case of Tintin. Even the\nharmless comics are not spared.  \nHope to God the passengers do return safely like in the Tintin comic\nFelt this was a highjacking 1st night when I heard how young the Copilot is\u2026\nI am curious what does age have to do with a hijacking or being a terrorist?\nMy thought was the copilot as well\u2026\nIn terms of why we think youth as related to terrorism in this case\u2013Islamic\nRadicalism, despite much press and popular opinion to the contrary, is a\nrelatively recent phenomenon. The younger population of countries like\nMalaysia, Iraq, Egypt, etc. tend to be more radical (and thus easier recruits)\nthan their parents or grandparents.\nIn addition, there\u2019s the rather obvious psychological idea that younger people\nare more generally risk takers and/or more willing to do dangerous things\u2013most\npeople, after all, enter dangerous careers (like the military, firefighting,\npolice, etc.) when young (and indestructible feeling).\n\u2026The above said as a man who joined the Army at 18, by the way.\nQuestion: I\u2019m surprised that authorities don\u2019t have flight data on hand, as\nisn\u2019t that auto-generated, regardless of whether there is voice communication\nfrom the cockpit? Don\u2019t airplanes \u201ccommunicate\u201d with ground facilities on a\nconstant basis, one system to another? When the Air France jet went down,\nweren\u2019t investigators able to immediately refer to a regular cadence of auto-\ngenerated data on engine speed, et al?\nIsn\u2019t that standard? Or just Airbus? Or only triggered when certain pre-set\nthresholds are crossed?\nAircraft to communicate with the ground at intervals. The aircraft has a\nspecial device to do so, called a transponder\u2026 which was off.\nYes, the 777 apparently has communicated with the ground, 4 hours after the\nlast known good location. Was a data update from the rolls Royce engines. New\ndeveloping story, google it. So they are claiming the engines were running for\n5 hours total. Draw a circle for distance, ITS HUGE. My guess, the kid flew\nback to Iran, almost.\nDebunked.\nWhoops! Weird page jump meant this was deposited in the wrong place.\nApologies.\nA definite funarama! A fortuitous True Detective gathering was swiftly\nrepurposed and we commenced bending our brains. Lots of wonderfully enjoyable\nclues \u2013 we particularly laughed at 17 down and 15 across, and filled 11 across\nin smugly since several of us wasted our youths that very way. Needless to\nsay, it was taxing. Very, very, taxing. 6 down in particular looked alluringly\nsimple but it took us forever until someone finally hauled it out of a memory\ncrevice. If you ever lie awake worrying you make these things too easy? DON\u2019T\nBOTHER.\n* Speculations: Not that I mind, but I think you just threw out a few speculations yourself, Patrick? At least its qualified speculations.\n* Pilots:  \nYou didnt say lack of hours is a factor (though it could be in any case), but\nyou mentioned hours required in the US to get a job like this. If the amount\nof hours was a problem in other countries we would have seen a lot more\naccidents. There are just too many pilots in the US figthing for the same job.\nOther countries have the same strict rules as the US when it comes to hiring a\nqualified pilot. Its just like any other demand: the more pilots to chose\nfrom, the more hours you need. Its obvious, they pick the ones with most\nexperience.\n*Human error vs mechanical failure:  \nThis is something that always baffles me when explaining accidents.  \n\u201cOh, it was a mechanical failure. The tail fell off. There was nothing we\ncould have done to prevent this from happening\u201d.  \nThat was just an example by the way.  \nEvery part on an aircraft is man made and its our job to make sure all parts\nare in good condition and replace them when they are not. When done right,\nthere are no mechanical malfunctions.  \nThus, as long as there is not a bomb or outside factors like extreme\nturbulence etc, all mechanical failures is a human error.\n*I know you asked us not to speculate, but here is mine;  \nPilot suicide. Its happened before and it would explain whey there were no\nmayday.\nThanks for this, Patrick; I was hoping to see your take on the situation. I\nwas particularly glad to read about what the lack of communication does or\ndoes not mean. I\u2019d assumed it might come last on the list when dealing with an\nemergency, but had no way of telling if that were true.\nNobody has even mentioned this, so it\u2019s probably a dumb question. Is it\npossible that MH370 had a mid-air collision with a private plane and that two\nplanes have actually gone down into the ocean? It happened once over the rain\nforest in Brazil, except the private plane, an Embraer Legacy 600 jet that was\nstruck by a Boeing 737, managed to land shortly after the strike. The people\non the Legacy 600 didn\u2019t know what had hit them until the authorities showed\nup to question them.\nAnything is possible, I suppose, but it seems unlikely. Apart from anything\nelse, there are no reports of a bizjet or whatever going missing at the same\ntime in the same general area.\nNot unheard of for a passenger jet to collide with another plane. A McDonnell-\nDouglas DC-9 collided with a Marine F-4B jet over the San Gabriel Mountains of\nSouthern California in June 1971. I heard the impact about 15 miles away.\nIndeed, I appreciate that \u2013 and Carole herself mentioned the collision in\nBrazil a few years ago.\nAll I\u2019m getting at was that had this happened on this occasion, we\u2019d probably\nhear about another missing plane.\nWhat if the plane was, say, a drug runner or something on those line? You\nmight not hear about it being missing. A stretch, of course.\n@JamieO\nYes, a drug plane or something similar is what I was thinking at that time,\ntoo.\nOr a big bird hits cockpit so hard and then decompresses the jet, everyone\ndies but jet on copilot flies, but gets diverted by high winds and ends up\nwhere no one knows. There have been times when birds got that high due to the\njet streams.\nCan a bird inhale oxygen at that high level?\nI believe this scenario is plausible, however, the analysis of the satellite\ndata by Inmarsat has determined the plane was on a southern trajectory. The\nsearch area was then based on the most southerly point of that trajectory\ngiven the amount of fuel the jet would have had.\nNothing flies that high except for other jets. A missing jet would be\nreported. Drug runners landing at outlying fields are flying light aircraft \u2013\njets need real airfields and a lot of support to land, takeoff, etc. Smuggling\nvia a jet would have to be a private flight through regular airports with a\nflight plan, clearances, etc., thus the missing aircraft (though not its real\npurpose) would be reported.\nUmm. Birds can\u2019t stay warm, much less breathe at 6 miles high.\nI\u2019d like to know how, in such a technologically advanced age, it\u2019s possible\nfor a plane to disappear.\nPresumably the black boxes are intact and would survive even an explosion on\nboard the plane.\nSo why isn\u2019t it possible for the black boxes to emit a signal continuously\nwhich would be tracked 24/7? If that were possible, and implemented, we would\nknow the precise route the plane took, whether it turned back or not, at what\nposition the black boxes started to fall, the route they took when falling,\nand where they are now!\nOne would think that a continuous satellite link, transmitting continuous GPS\ncoordinates, would not consume tremendous bandwidth, even for the tens of\nthousands of jets simultaneously in flight.\nArticle explaining the state of cockpit tech:\nhttp://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/aviation-is-stuck-in-the-60s-a-\nreflection-on-mh-370.html\nI read that article and while I\u2019m not an aviation expert, it doesn\u2019t pass the\nsmell test in several ways.\nThe overall problem with his assertions is that he values features over\nreliability. And reliability usually *decreases* with complexity. For example,\nhe wants to augment radio communication with internet-based communications.\nOut in the middle of the ocean, does he really expect internet communications\n(travelling over good old radio waves) to be more reliable than radio voice?\nSimilarly, I suspect the reason why pilots don\u2019t have Yahoo-based weather maps\nwith groovy maps is because they don\u2019t need it. Their company continuously\nmonitors weather with far better systems back at their central control rooms\nand will let them know if they should change course / altitude / speed / etc\nto prepare for weather ahead.\nI suspect airplane tech values reliability over everything else. After all,\nwe\u2019re upset that a plane in the middle of the ocean, possibly facing\ncatastrophic systems failure, was unable to communicate, while plenty of us\nhave to reboot our routers / phones / etc on a frequent basis in far less\nextreme situations.\nRegardless, the facts speak for themselves: despite being ancient tech, air\ntravel is still stunningly reliable. New technology has a very high bar to\nclear before being accepted as superior to current technology.\nIt\u2019s not easy to keep a continuous beacon on.\nFirst, it requires quite a bit of electricity, and you don\u2019t really wanna put\na big and possibly incendiary battery in your black box.\nSecond, when over the ocean the beacon has to communicate quite far, either to\na satellite or a ground based antenna that\u2019s possibly over a thousand miles\naway. That takes a lot of power in either case, and for satellites, requires\nthat there be a directional antenna pointing at a satellite. Those antennas\nneed to be dynamically adjusted to keep position with the satellite, which\nadds a lot of complexity and electricity.\nThird, once the black box sinks into the ocean, it will not be able to\nbroadcast. First, the probability of an electrical short is very high, and\nsecond water is absolutely brutal to radio waves, and it\u2019s pretty much\nimpossible to make a radio communication from the bottom of the ocean to the\nsurface, even with vast amounts of transmitting power.\nCouldn\u2019t a beacon from the black box be powered by the plane\u2019s electrical\nsystem during flight, and have a small battery to power for (what would be a\nvery) short time once it dislodged from the plane during a crash? Can\u2019t take\nthat much electricity to send your flight #, a timestamp and GPS coordinates\nevery 5 seconds or so.\nThis would have to always be on, and not be able to be switched off.\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m talking about, please feel free to demonstrate\nwhy this is difficult\u2026\nA little bit about how GPS works:\nThe reason almost anything can get a GPS co-ordinate is that all of the GPS\nsatellites are broadcasting at pretty high power all of the time. So your\nphone\u2019s GPS just receives their signals, triangulates based on the clock\ncontent of the signals from the various satellites it hears from, and then\nit\u2019s got its position.\nImportantly however, your GPS device has not communicated that information to\nanywhere else. **The problem is not getting the plane to know where the plane\nis, it\u2019s transmitting that to the outside world.**\nOver land, this is easy, we\u2019ve got cell phone towers over every bit of\npopulated Earth (except most of North Korea), which can be communicated with\nby a fairly low power radio. But when you\u2019re over the ocean, you have to\ntransmit hundreds of miles to hit the nearest receiver, either a satellite or\na ground based antenna.\nWhen you transmit, you can either transmit a broadcast in all directions, or\nuse a specially designed antenna to broadcast in a particular direction. An\nexample of a directional broadcast would be those TV trucks with the little\ndish thing on the top to send their signal to a satellite.\nWhen you broadcast a radio signal, your signal falls off by the square of\ndistance. So a signal that\u2019s interpretable to 30 miles in clear weather uses\n9x the power of one that goes to 10 miles. One that goes 100 miles would take\n100x the power, and one to 500 miles would take 2500x the power of a 10 mile\nsignal. Geostationary orbit, which is where communications satellites live, is\na bit over 22,000 miles above Earth. Because of this, you basically have to\nuse a directional antenna to communicate with those satellites, or else be\nusing an incredibly high power transmitter (which will interfere with every\nother plane near you trying to do the same thing as well as possibly the\nplane\u2019s comms and is a disaster). Even for the shorter distances to land based\ntowers, without directional broadcast, it will be an interference nightmare to\nhave planes making high power pings every minute or two \u2013 and there\u2019s no free\nspectrum for them to do it on anyway.\nSo, a directional antenna can be done on a plane. It\u2019s how you can get wifi on\nsome transoceanic flights (I believe American has been adding this to their\nfleet for one). And the TV systems in a JetBlue plane use one, though just a\nreceiver I believe. But it requires a lot of work to install, and can\u2019t really\nbe fitted within the black box. It would be an expensive mandate to put one of\nthese on every plane, probably a $100k-1000k retrofit. It might be worth\ndoing, but planes vanishing is, notwithstanding this current incident,\nincredibly rare. And even having the technology might not prevent (m)any of\nthese incidents \u2013 just help find the wreckage. I doubt the cost/benefit makes\nsense.\nThank you, well explained.\nSo what You\u2019re saying is that the Iridium Sat phone system is nothing more\nthan a brainchild or sci-fi. Iridium is capable of receiving ACARS\ntransmissions nowadays and it is used by airlines for that purpose. The sat\nphones I\u2019ve seen and operated are small mobile units that would easily fit\ninto a black box. However they are unable to transmit when submerged. That\nwould require a very long wave transmission and a long aerial.\nThe question of satellite communication uplinks using omnidirectional (or\nnearly omni) antennas has been definitively answered by the existence of small\n\u201cSpot 2\u201d systems and other low-power GPS coordinate uplink tracking devices\navailable to the commercial market. These use less than half a watt of\ntransmitting power (in burst mode), and can run several days with two AAA\nbatteries. There is no real directionality to the antenna system \u2013 it just has\nto be facing the sky (in general) to work. I regularly use one of these for\ntracking hikes and for a backup ELT for my airplane. These communicate with a\nset of relatively low earth orbit (GlobalStar) satellites \u2013 they are about 900\nmiles up.\nThe information re: \u201cJames Bond Remote Control Takeover\u201d is inaccurate. Boeing\nhas coded backdoors into their flight computer software since the late 90\u2019s,\nmostly for maintenance issues on the ground. However, with the ability to GPS\nspoof, the RQ-170 comes to mind, it\u2019s entirely plausible that a similar attack\nwas initiated on the gps rx and the aircraft remotely taken. Sounds far\nfetched until you start studying how Iran was able to gain control over one of\nthe most top secret US drones using MIL GPS\u2026  \nFurthermore I believe Keith Ledgerwood\u2019s account to be an accurate depiction\nof what happend. Radar Altimeter would not show another a/c in the vicinity if\nthe a/c was flying directly above and aft of SIA68. Again, that is entirely\nplausible and the radar data Mr. Ledgerwood overlaid is legit and factual\ndata.  \nI also, don\u2019t believe the aircraft ended up on Diego Garcia island\u2026 The Chagos\ntrench happens to be just to the east of DGNSF and attains a depth over over\n15,000ft deep. If I was in charge of that operation, I would not put MH370 on\nthe ground where prying eyes and twitter/instagrams could pose a security\nthreat. I\u2019d put it in the ocean where no prying eyes or snooping submarines\ncould see what I was up to. It wouldn\u2019t be hard for the USN to recover the\ncargo and blackbox in the amount of time the ac has been missing. There are\n4000 US and British military personnel on that island. I guarantee someone\nwould have seen something. Also, how does a fire suppression container from a\nBOEING 777-200ER wash up on an atoll in the Northern Maldive Islands?!?!?!\nBecause those fall out of commercial aircraft on the regular\u2026. lol\n\u201c\u2026 The information re: \u201cJames Bond Remote Control Takeover\u201d is inaccurate\u2026\nNo it is not. There is absolutely no way to fly a 777, or any other commercial\nplane, from the ground. Period. End of story. I love it how I am the one who\nflies Boeings for a living, meanwhile all the non-pilots out there are\nconfidently telling me how I\u2019m wrong I am.\n\u201c\u2026Boeing has coded backdoors into their flight computer software since the\nlate 90\u2019s, mostly for maintenance issues on the ground\u2026\u201d\nWhatever. That does not extrapolate to the easy ability to hijack a jetliner\nvia remote control. And what of the fact that the pilots would be sitting\nright there? The idea that the jet could be \u201chacked\u201d out from under them and\nflown off somewhere else is too ludicrous for words.\nShort question regarding plane position data transmission. Would it not be\npossible for future gps systems to use a relay datalink between airplanes.\nSort of like in a zigbee fashion? That would mean as soon as one plane is in\nsignal reach of another plane, data is transferred and relayed to the next one\neventually ending up at a ground station without the need for satellites. Of\ncourse if a plane is outside signal range of all other planes it would still\nbe lost but it would be yet another system that might keep track of the\nplane\u2019s position. And we know aviation loves redundancy. Mayby there is such a\nsystem already and I just haven\u2019t heard of it. Sort of passing the bucket in a\nfire-line instead of having to have a really long hose.\nAre they upgrading their systems under the cockpit on Malaysian 777, do you\nknow? I have a feeling that that may be the problem.\nYOU MUST BE CAREFUL HERE,MOST OF THE  \nCOMMENT ABOUT  \nJOINING ILLUMINATI ARE FAKE I WAS  \nRECEY OU VNTLY SCAM BY 3  \nPEOPLVVE CLAIMING TO BE ILLUMINATI AGENT.I  \nLOST OVVNTIL A FRIEND DIRECT MELEASE IF  \nYOU WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF ILLUMINATI  \nQUICKLY CALL  \n+2348130790663 OR you can send messages on  \nWhatsapp on  \nsame number +23408130790663 or email us at williamstomos4@gmail.com,you can\ncall our new head office in USA because  \nour head office is no longer in UK we are now located In USA for  \nconfirmations call our head office number  \nHEAD OFFICE NUMBER: +1(862)260-4433\nIt\u2019s true that broadcasting radio waves from underwater is unfeasible, but the\nblack boxes do have a sonar beacon that can broadcast from the ocean floor,\nand they work for 30 days continuously. Here\u2019s a quotation from an expert:\n\u201cUnder good conditions, the signal can be detected from several hundred miles\naway. If the boxes are trapped inside the wreckage, the sound may not travel\nfar. If the boxes are at the bottom of an underwater trench, that also hinders\nthe signal, which can also weaken over time.\u201d\n\u2013 John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe conditions for sonar must not be good; otherwise, I\u2019d think they\u2019d already\nhave been able to locate the black boxes.\nThe range for the underwater transmission by the black box is no more than a\nfew miles. If it lies in 15,000\u2032 of water, you would pretty much have to be on\nthe surface directly above it to detect it. We\u2019re talking about an expanse of\nocean larger than Texas, with depths in excess of 15,000\u2032 in some places.\nExactly why can\u2019t they do that I mean really it\u2019s not that hard\nWhat the need is all the flight info to be sent to satellites then bounced to\na center that tracks all flights and let the black boxes just be back ups.\nAnd then I added my own typo in the correction. Good times.\nAs a former journalist, what bothers me most about news media reporting of the\nMalaysian Airlines tragedy is the failure to explain certain speculative\npossibilities for the crash \u2014 primarily whether two passengers could have\nbrought down an airliner in flight. Journalists should include information\nfrom aviation safety experts, especially engineers, who might have some\ninformative perspectives. Unless there was an egregious security screening\nlapse, would it be possible for an individual, or two, to carry components of\nan explosive device aboard without detection? Then, how much explosive power\nwould be necessary to substantially damage a Boeing 777 in flight? Then, where\nwould the device have to be placed for maximum effect? (bathroom?) Of course,\nthis would be a response to a speculative question, but it is the nature of\nnews media, and human nature, to wonder why an otherwise safe aircraft might\ndisappear at cruise altitude. Media have an obligation to analyze speculative\nreasons by including information that would provide perspective.\nIf there had been an explosion, wouldn\u2019t there be debris scattered everywhere,\neasy to see? I think it\u2019s much more likely that the plane went into the water\nmore or less in one piece.\nI am not 100% sure but I would be thinking if it was coming out of the sky it\nwould be falling pretty fast\u2026 hence on impact into the water it would break\nup. Unless of course it was guided down nice and easily then different story.\nI am curious- what are the probabilities of it breaking up as opposed to\nstaying in one piece and sinking straight down? I was watching a documentary\nabout Ethiopian Flight 961 the other day. The pilot was forced to land it in\nthe ocean next to a beach after it ran out of fuel. According to the doc, some\nplanes have a smooth bottom, others have engines hanging beneath the wings.\nThe ones with a smooth bottom have a somewhat better ability to land in water\nthan ones with engines hanging below the wings, because the engines act like a\nscoop, fill with water, and cause the plane to cartwheel. That\u2019s what happened\nto the Ethiopian Flight, and it broke apart into 4 or 5 pieces. So if for some\nreason, the pilots tried to land the Malaysia plane on the water, it would\nhave probably broken apart, and I\u2019m guessing there would be more debris. I\nthink the only other possibility is that the plane plunged into the water at a\nhigh rate of speed, with no one attempting to slow it down to execute a\ncontrolled landing. Would it be more or less likely to break up if that were\nthe case? I really don\u2019t know, so I\u2019m hoping someone here could enlighten me.\nYou know what, nevermind, I answered my own question after thinking about it\nfor a bit. It\u2019s obvious, actually. Water is just as hard a concrete to an\nobject slamming into it. Of course the plane broke up, probably into lots of\nsmall pieces. I assume much of the debris has sunk by now, making it difficult\nfor anyone to find a trace of the plane.\nRachel, you make several good points: landing on water is like landing on\ngreen concrete, except it\u2019s wet. And, low wing-mounted engines might certainly\ncause the cartwheeling process you describe. Under that theory, a plane like a\n727, with its fuselage and tail mounted engines has a better chance of landing\nin one piece. Anyone care to chime in on that?\nBut the more important idea is that if the plane broke up, as is likely in a\nforced ditching in the open ocean, and even if every part of the plane sank,\nthere is still a huge amount of floating debris that comes off the plane; seat\ncushions, luggage, clothing, personal items, blankets, bodies, insulation,\nplastic panels, etc. The idea that all this stuff is nowhere to be found\nreally argues against a sea ditching, but where the hell in the suspected area\n(or the max fuel range) would/could you land something this big without\nsomeone noticing? You can\u2019t land a 777 on a grass strip or road or field or\nbeach, or even a little local airport designed for Cessna 172\u2019s. I\u2019m sure\nPatrick knows what the minimum runway is for a loaded 777 at that temp and\naltitude is, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me a bit if it was 7-8K feet or more.\nAlso, if you\u2019re doing this at night without ATC landing guidance then runway\nlights would be a good thing. Just where do you have all that and no radar?\nCirculating on email \u2013 \u2013  \nThe American is withdrawing from the Afghanistan, one of their command and\ncontrol system (used for controlling the pilotless drones) was hijacked by the\nTalebans when the American transport convoy was moving down from one of the\nhill top bases. The Talebans ambushed the convoy and killed 2 American Seal\npersonnel, seized the equipment/weapons, including the command and control\nsystem which weighed about 20 tons and packed into 6 crates. This happened\nabout a month ago in Feb 2014.  \nWhat the Talebans want is money. They want to sell the system to the Russian\nor the Chinese. The Russian is too busy in Ukraine. The Chinese are hungry for\nthe system\u2019s technology. Just imagine if the Chinese master the technology\nbehind the command and control system, all the American drones will become\nuseless. So the Chinese sent 8 top defense scientists to check the system and\nagreed to pay millions for it.  \nSometime in early Mar 2014, the 8 scientists and the 6 crates made their way\nto Malaysia, thinking that it was the best covert way to avoid detection. The\ncargo was then kept in the Embassy under diplomatic protection. Meanwhile the\nAmerican has engaged the assistance of Israeli intelligence, and together they\nare determined to intercept and recapture the cargo.  \nThe Chinese calculated that it will be safe to transport it via civilian\naircraft so as to avoid suspicion. After all the direct flight from KL to\nBeijing takes only 4 and half hours, and the American will not hijack or harm\nthe civilian. So MH370 is the perfect carrier.  \nThere are 5 American and Israeli agents onboard who are familiar with Boeing\noperation. The 2 \u201cIranians\u201d with stolen passports could be among them.  \nWhen MH370 is about to leave the Malaysian air space and reporting to\nVietnamese air control, one American AWAC jammed their signal, disabled the\npilot control system and switched over to remote control mode. That was when\nthe plane suddenly lost altitude momentarily.  \nHow the AWAC can do it ? Remember 911 incident ? After the 911 incident, all\nBoeing aircraft (and possibly all Airbus) are installed with remote control\nsystem to counter terrorist hijacking. Since then all the Boeing could be\nremote controlled by ground control tower. The same remote control system used\nto control the pilotless spy aircraft and drones.  \nThe 5 American/Israeli agents soon took over the plane, switched off the\ntransponder and other communication system, changed course and flew westwards.\nThey dare not fly east to Philippines or Guam because the whole South China\nSea air space was covered by Chinese surveillance radar and satellite.  \nThe Malaysian, Thai and Indian military radars actually detected the\nunidentified aircraft but did not react professionally.  \nThe plane flew over North Sumatra, Anambas, South India and then landed at\nMaldives (some villagers saw the aircraft landing), refuelled and continued\nits flight to Garcia Deigo, the American Air Base in the middle of Indian\nOcean. The cargo and the black box were removed. The passengers were silenced\nvia natural means, lack of oxygen. They believe only dead person will not\ntalk. The MH370 with dead passengers were air borne again via remote control\nand crashed into South Indian Ocean, make it to believe that the plane\neventually ran out of fuel and crashed, and blame the defiant captain and\ncopilot.  \nThe American has put up a good show. First diverting all the attention and\nsearch effort in the South China Sea while the plane made their way to Indian\nOcean. Then they came out with some conflicting statement and evidence to\nconfuse the world. The Australian is the co-actor.  \nThe amount of effort put up by China, in terms of the number of search\naircraft, ships and satellites, searching first the South China Sea, then the\nMalacca Straits and the Indian Ocean is unprecedented. This showed that the\nChina is very concerned, not so much because of the many Chinese civilian\npassengers, but mainly the high value cargo and its 8 top defense scientists.  \nDon\u2019t ask how true is this but Grt conspiracy theory \u2026\u2026 worth a read\nThis email is barely coherent to begin with (i.e. \u201cthe Talebans\u201d), but for the\nrecord\u2026\n>> How the AWAC can do it ? Remember 911 incident ? After the 911 incident,\nall Boeing aircraft (and possibly all Airbus) are installed with remote\ncontrol system to counter terrorist hijacking. Since then all the Boeing could\nbe remote controlled by ground control tower. The same remote control system\nused to control the pilotless spy aircraft and drones. << This is totally and\nunconditionally FALSE. There is no way to remotely control any commercial\njetliner. Not even CLOSE.\nHello Jim, landing on water in one piece, a remote maybe-could be done to a,\nsharp point of success, but at what speed ? too slow you fall too fast and\nbreak up, leaving debris, too slow you plummit, too fast you break up on\nimpact, hitting water even at 50 miles an hour is like hitting cement, since\nit can\u2019t be compressed it will resist like cement\u2013just the right speed to not\nbreak up and sink would be same odds as entering earths atmosphere from space\nwith not knowing at all what angle to enter for success, but that narrow angle\nis about exact window of 11 degrees i believe. no not the same for landing on\nwater especially with no skids. hope to hear from you \ud83d\ude42 Joe S. bc MI\nEasy way to join the illuminati brotherhood in the world.Kindly contact ( Mr\nRONY ) the illuminati online registration officer in USA through their email\nnow: illuminatiworldoffirm@gmail.com and you shall be given an idea chance to\nvisit the satan and his representative after registrations is completed by\nyou,no sacrifice of human life needed,illuminati brotherhood brings along\nwealth and famous in life,you have a full access to eradicate(eliminate\n)poverty away from your life now.So contact ( Mr RONY ) hook the online\nregister @:illuminatiworldoffirm@gmail\nWhat about all the passengers with cell phones? If I thought my plane was\nhaving trouble I\u2019d be sending out all of my \u201cgoodbye, I Love you\u201d messages.\nMaybe no cell signal at first but for 500 miles? Just seems odd to me not one\ncall or text rec\u2019d from passengers. Are there onboard telephones that crew\ncould have used?\nIndeed that is why every single one is absolutely dead, barring perhaps a lone\nmiracle or two who quite possibly could have survived the initial crash. There\nis zero chance the plane could have been sucessfully hijacked or otherwise\nsafely landed, as somebody would have gotten off a message.\nI was wondering the same thing..not ONE passenger of flight attendant tried to\nget a call out after they relized they weren\u2019t going to China & assuming that\none of the pilots was flying, why didn\u2019t they try to talk to them? What were\nthe passengers told, if anything? Someone would definitely have used an\nelectronic device to send the word out something was horribly wrong.\nIf the catastrophy happened so sudden and so violet, there wont be enough time\nfor the passengers to respond and have messages sent out.\nCell phones have a range of maybe 5 miles. They were a couple hundred miles\nout to sea. There isn\u2019t any way a cell phone could have worked.\nI\u2019m so glad someone finally addressed the question of passenger cell phones.\nMany calls and texts were sent out on 9/11. It\u2019s impossible for me to\nunderstand how not one message seems to have been sent or received. For this\nreason, I think the passengers perished FAST and before there was any hint of\ntrouble.\nNo. For this reason, the 9/11 story was b/s.\nI don\u2019t believe the story of phone calls from the 9/11 planes either.\nThis story and the author lost me when he mentioned the calls from 9/11  \nThere were no calls and this is just BS.\nThe planes on 9/11 were flying much lower, over land, and so could access cell\nphone networks. Seat back phones were also used.\nYou aren\u2019t saying that all those voice mails and messages on answering\nmachines were faked ? Families have saved the messages.\nExactly.. and the answer addresses an issue with the so called, official 9/11\nstory. But it didn\u2019t seem to be a problem on that day. Funny how that works!\n\u201d For position reporting and traffic sequencing purposes, transponders only\nwork in areas of typical ATC radar coverage. Most of the world, including the\noceans, does not have ATC radar coverage. Transponders are relevant to this\nstory only when the missing plane was close to land. Once over the ocean, it\ndidn\u2019t matter anyway\u201d.  \nNo.  \nAn additional radar, an ELT (emergency locator transmitter), is a radar\ntransmitter that is mandatory equipment in aircraft. Its primary purpose is to\nidentify the location of an aircraft that has crashed. An ELT signal wouldn\u2019t\nbe detectable after an aircraft had sunk in the ocean, in any case, but the\nELT was turned off when this flight disappeared.  \nIt\u2019s getting hard to see the disinformation through the chemtrails. The white\naircraft that spray these chemicals are required to report their position to\nthe FAA. In fact, they don\u2019t ever do so, and they\u2019re not visible on radar.\nThis is completely incorrect. An ELT (emergency locator transmitter) does not\nuse radar whatsoever. It is a simple device that transmits on a discreet VHF\nand UHF frequency for search and rescue purposes. It can be manually activated\nin the flight deck or automatically activated after recognizing a hard impact\nsuch as a crash.\nIf electrical power was compromised or a fire broke out its very possible the\nELT was not activated. Even if it was it would be unlikely that the signal\nwould be noticed if the aircraft was indeed in a remote location. Newer ELTs\nare designed to send a signal to a satelite or GPS location for accurate\ndetection. It is not known if this aircraft was equipped with that new system.\nChemtrails? Come back to reality. You self proclaimed experts do yourself more\nharm then good. If you are truly interested in Aviation do yourself a favor,\ngo to an airport and find a flight school. Take some lessons are learn\nsomething by actually doing it. Not reading crazy stories on the internet.\nDid you not read the \u201cWhy no cell phone\u201d section in the above article? Good\ngrief.\nJoanne you did not read the article did you\u2026the cell phones do not work.\nWHY NO PHONE CALLS? Some have wondered why, assuming the jet was hijacked,\npassengers did not place cell phone calls to loved ones, as occurred during\nthe 9/11 attacks. Does the absence of call records suggest the passengers had\nbeen incapacitated somehow, or that the plane had met a sudden end? No. Unless\nan aircraft is flying low and within range of a cell tower, cellular calling\nfrom a plane does not work. Your phone will not maintain a signal. Some\nairplanes are equipped with special technology that permits calling via\nsatellite or using radio frequencies to transmit cellular calls, but I\u2019m\nuncertain if Malaysia\u2019s 777s have this technology. Even if they do it could\nhave been intentionally turned off or suffered a power failure, no different\nfrom the plane\u2019s other communications equipment.\nnext time read before you make an ass of yourself\nOf course, the Knight says sarcastically. Because, as you know there are a\nbunch of cell phone towers in the middle of the Indian Ocean! Sheesh!\nYOU WROTE: Unless there was an egregious security screening lapse, would it be\npossible for an individual, or two, to carry components of an explosive device\naboard without detection? Then, how much explosive power would be necessary to\nsubstantially damage a Boeing 777 in flight? Then, where would the device have\nto be placed for maximum effect? (bathroom?)\n\u2026 God bless you are a FORMER journalist.. What do you think? If this was\nreally done by terrorists, why should any media solve questions like the best\nplace to put a bomb? For the next terrorist? You wanna produce a Podcast for\nthem too? THINK \u2026\nfrom a Malaysian point of view; i think this is a distraction but the\nconspirators underestimated the global attention.\nthe global community must press on with due diligence and take no words from\nthat govt for granted.\nIf malaysian military tracked an unknown aircraft over their country wouldn\u2019t\nthey send fighter planes to investigate? Surely they wouldn\u2019t just watch it\u2026\u2026.\nMaybe they shot it down.\nToday they acknowledged that there was a radar sighting of something but\ncouldn\u2019t say what it was.\nI smell a cover up here.\nDid the aircraft have enough fuel to hit the Maldive International Airport in\nthe Indian Ocean?  \nWall Street Journal gives me the impression that officials are entertaining\nthe notion of hijacked \u2014 and the Maldives seem to fit the bill geographically\nand sadly, politically. It\u2019s recently taken some heat for it\u2019s new and very\nlovely Islamic make-over.  \nJust saying.\nI\u2019m with you John on that location. Ask the clairvoyants \u2013 could prove more a\nsure thing than speculation.\nI\u2019m puzzled by the villager sightings of a large low flying plane on a\nsoutherly Maldives Island around 06.35 am Saturday morning, fits with theory\nof sudden catastrophic fault causing pilots to take immediate turn back but\nfailing to program in the whole \u2018new route\u2019 code before losing consciousness.\nThe plane then flys on (probably having soared in height due to\ndepressurisation) and continued on the input trajectory until the aircraft ran\nout of fuel, would have lost altitude over time due to fuselage damage. Makes\nsense, why was it dismissed? Why would a bunch of villagers on some remote\nisland make up something as vivid as that? I think the search crews are\nlooking in the wrong place and the sorrow I feel intuitively when I meditate\nis palpable and excruciating, almost as if a spiritual collective mind is\ntelling me: why can\u2019t they find us, why can\u2019t our relatives know where and how\nwe perished.\nI think the reason that has been dismissed is that the Maldives authorities\nhave ruled that out as a possibility. They said no such aircraft flew over\ntheir airspace.\nAlso note, Maldives is a shallow water tourist destination \u2013 lots of\nforeigners in a small space. If it landed, everyone near the airport would\nknow. If it went in the water, there would be a large number of eyewitness,\nand the wreckage / debris field would be visible from a boat on the surface.  \nThe same goes for Diego Garcia theories \u2013 US personnel are on the island year\nround. I have met people who were deployed there.\nWhy is nobody talking about this being related to all the other crisis going\non in the world?This airplane could have been used to test the satellite and\nradar capabilities of other countries as a strategic military exercise. Think\nabout it\u2026.fighter jets and submarines carrying around nukes during WW3! There\nare to many things going on everywhere to deny the obvious, the only question\nis when will the war be publicly announced and in full effect. We have China\nand Japan, North and South Korea, Israel and the Arab Nation, Russia and\nUkraine, Syria and all other crisis as well. These countries are way more\nadvanced and have enhanced strategic plans from experience during the first\ntwo world wars. The rumors of wars could be at the end to where the war is\nfinally here. Dont get me wrong by reading this, I am a decent human being and\ndo send my condolences to the passengers of the missing Malaysian plane. GOD\nHELP US ALL!!!!\nAnyone with funding, e.g., a government, could simply hire a charter aircraft\nto test the same thing. Drug runners and smugglers penetrate air defense ID\nzones successfully all the time. But that is no test of the ability to launch\na major war undetected \u2013 thousands of aircraft, equipment, personnel, etc.\nhave to be mobilized, and everyone with satellites watches for that, e.g., the\ncurrent crisis in the Ukraine. Besides, who is going to attack whom in your\nWW3 scenario? Only US and Russia have credible strategic bomber forces. Both\nalso have ICBMs and missile subs. Neither could attack the other without\npretty much destroying the entire northern hemisphere. Neither Putin nor Obama\nseems bent on national suicide. Calm down.\nThe weirdest thing of everything is when I asked an air plane technician about\nTHEIR opinions, they said \u201cIm very sorry i am not allowed to comment at this\ntime\u201d. What in the holy is going on! It is not weird people wonder about\neverything! Especially in the combination of the words of the co-pilot: \u201cAll\nright, good night.\u201d .. Why are not technicians allowed to answer a simple\nquestion??\n2 possibilities. Either the person you talked to is not a \u201cplane technician\u201d\n(don\u2019t even know what that means) or your story is a lie.\nPlease re-read Patrick\u2019s treatise above on this bit of conversation between\nthe flight deck(Capt or 1st Ofc?) and ATC. This is very common, a polite way\nof who ever\u2019s in communication with ATC for thanking the controller for\nhis/her help in leaving the Terminal Control Area and handing the flight off\nto en en-route controller, possibly in this case to Vietnam ATC, since that\nwas the planned route.\nAnything more cryptic and or even borderline rude would have been a source of\nwonderment by ATC as to why this person on the flight deck had a rag up\nhis/her butt. It\u2019s common courtesy between flight crew and ATC.\nMy advice to you is purchase a scanner radio that receives frequencies between\n108.00 & 164.00 MHz and listen. You will hear that ALL THE TIME. They need to\ncommunicate quickly basic information, then get off so others can use the\nfrequency, but they are human. It\u2019s just a basic courtesy. People act like he\nwas saying \u201cGoodbye cruel World!\u201d He just was being handed off and\nacknowledged that he wouldn\u2019t be communicating with that ATC anymore. He said\n\u201cGood Night.\u201d It is not ominous.\nI keep seeing everyone say the range of the pinger is 2 miles. Range in what?\nair? Water, What Type of water, etc.\nI would guess that sound travels as much as 5 x faster in water than air. Also\nfrom my science days I remember that in water with lots of different layers\nyou can get a sound wave to change direction by as much as 90 degrees. But TV\nstations like CNNN just keep saying 2 mile range.\ncan someone shed some more light on this?\nSavin\nBeen reading just about every possibility including explosives and have also\nbeen keeping up with the Korean Sewol ferry disaster when something clicked\nthat I haven\u2019t heard suggested, well not suggested like this. What is the\npossibility that the MH370 wasn\u2019t brought down by any type of explosive, what\nif just one of the two pilots were taken out and before the airline ran out of\nfuel, had a perfect water landing which left no debris as there was no damage\nto leave any. On top of what I just mentioned, could the pilot after landing\nthe plane kept it pressurized preventing the staff from opening the emergency\ndoors and on top of that gave instructions to stay put like the captain of the\nSewol had done? Could there be enough pressure to stop the doors from being\nopened and same time sink the plane where as it was then too late to open time\ndoors as the plane sank beneath the sea and if the plane sank while\npressurized even with people panicking as the plane went under, could it still\nhave held enough pressure to keep all doors stuck closed? Would an airplane\nstill sink being pressurized plus being far out at sea peoples cell phones not\nwork at all, no text, no email, etcetc. And last but not least, is it possible\nfor any of the flight crew to not only keep the airplane pressurized to not\nonly keep the doors closed, but same time depressurized the cockpit so a\nwindow could be broken so they could escape meaning one of the pilots leaving\nthe rest to perish? If this did happen, how long would it take for the plane\nto decompose and when it happened, would there be anything inside that one day\nmight float to the surface like cushion\u2019s being submerged so long that might\none day point to the area where the plane really went down? The above sounds\nmore realistic, though friend of mine who quoted the impossible of the plane\ngoing into space made a semi valid point. There isn\u2019t enough power to get an\nairplane into space but during that time there was an eclipse. Could there\nhave been a rare possibility that this eclipse interfered with gravity high up\nleaving a window of opertunity for the plane to actually break free of earths\nhravitional pull and that the satalites ping showing the path of the plane\nwouldn\u2019t be able to tell that the direction was coming from above it instead\nof below? I\u2019m more for the first scenario, though the second sounds like a\nsmall possibility as well.\nHave you been rejected, frustrated, and you think there is no hope for you any\nmore, or are you a business man or woman, an artist, student, pastor or do you\nwant to be rich, famous and be powerful in life or have you been looking for\nan opportunity to be a member of the great Illuminati.

But it wasn\u2019t able to\nanswer the fundamental question of what happened to the plane. French\nauthorities have even  started a new investigation into what really happened.\nHere\u2019s what we know, what theories have been put forward, and the questions\nthat remain.\nFlight MH370, a Boeing 777, left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 12:41 a.m. local\ntime on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board.\nMore than 150 passengers were Chinese. There were also 38 Malaysians, seven\nIndonesians, six Australians, and several passengers from a host of other\ncountries, including France and the US. Twelve crew members were on board as\nwell.\n![](/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg)\nThe final voice communication from the cockpit, less than an hour after\ntakeoff, was \u201cGood night, Malaysian three-seven-zero.\u201d\nThe plane then stopped communicating with ground control.\nIt deviated from its route two hours after takeoff, according to data from\nmilitary radar.\nFor reasons still unknown, the plane abruptly turned back toward Malaysia,\nthen on toward the Indian Ocean.\n![MH370's path before it\ndisappeared.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/07/07/5b5c81ab2be4ab1a008b481c.png)\nThere were no reports of bad weather or distress calls.\nThe plane traveled south and may have changed altitude at some point. It sent\na final, automated satellite communication that was received but did not\ncontain any information about where it was.\nOther aircraft communications had been purposefully disabled earlier or\nsomehow powered down in the flight, authorities said. The plane had\ndisappeared.\nSearch attempts were quickly launched, but investigators had little idea of\nwhere to start and a vast swathe of territory where the plane could feasibly\nbe.\nTeams from Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia were searching the water near\nVietnam \u2013 which is partway between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing \u2013 about 12 hours\nafter contact was lost.\nFBI teams and Interpol personnel flew in to assist, with nine countries\ncontributing to the initial search. Forty ships worked around the clock, and\n34 aircraft flew during daylight hours.\nA total of 26 countries eventually pitched in as the search area widened. They\nfound nothing.\n![](/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg)\nOn May 5, 2014, 79 days after the plane went missing, Malaysia, Australia, and\nChina announced their agreement to search underwater. At the request of the\nMalaysian government, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau led the\ninvestigation. But it discovered little.\nOn January 29, 2015, 327 days after the plane vanished, Malaysia  officially\ndeclared the disappearance an accident.\nA  report one year after the disappearance \u201cgave a detailed picture of delays\nand protocol violations\u201d before the search was launched, CNN said.\nIt said that five hours and 13 minutes passed between the last communication\nfrom the plane and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s first distress signal and that another five\nhours passed before the first search flights took off, according to CNN.\nThe Malaysian government\u2019s  final report, released on July 30, 2018, said\nauthorities \u201ccannot determine with any certainty\u201d why the plane disappeared.\nThe key finding was that the plane\u2019s sharp diversion at 1:25 a.m. was done\nmanually, but it is still unclear who was responsible for the maneuver.\n_**Read more:** The final MH370 report declares a critical turn by the doomed\nflight was made manually, but investigators don\u2019t know who did it_\nMalaysia\u2019s civil aviation chief  resigned after the report found that air\ntraffic control did not comply with standard procedures.\nThe first piece of MH370 took more than a year to find. The fragment of the\nplane\u2019s wing  washed up in July 2015 on R\u00e9union Island, thousands of miles\nfrom Kuala Lumpur.\nAfter a four-month hiatus for detailed mapping of the seabed, the search\nresumed in October 2015, but bad weather slowed the investigation.\nA report in March 2016, on the two-year anniversary of the disappearance,\nshed no more light on what happened.\n![](/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg)\nBy May 2016 more than 105,000 square kilometers (65,240 square miles) of\nseafloor in the southern Indian Ocean had been covered, leaving 15,000 square\nkilometers left to search in the area.\nIn July 2016, the Dutch company hired by Australian authorities to lead the\nsearch  said it may have been looking in the wrong area for the past two\nyears.\nThe fruitless search was  suspended in January 2017, after more than $140\nmillion was spent. Officials said it was possible the crash site was farther\nnorth. Families of passengers and crew members had become so frustrated that\nthey  launched their own search for debris in Madagascar.\nIn the year that followed, organizations like Australia\u2019s chief science agency\nreleased reports, while analyses of satellite imagery and debris continued\namid talks to formally begin a new search.\nThe Malaysian government started the latest search in January 2018 with Ocean\nInfinity, a private firm based in the US. It covered 112,000 square kilometers\nin the southern Indian Ocean, including a 25,000-square-kilometer target area\nthat hadn\u2019t been searched before.\nIt was  called off on May 29 with no new significant new findings, though\ninvestigators said they  still wanted to search farther north.\nIn five years of searching, the only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777\naircraft have been three wing fragments that washed up on Indian Ocean coasts,\nin Madagascar, R\u00e9union Island, and Tanzania.\nMalaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has said Malaysia would consider\nresuming the search if there were new clues.\nThe lack of answers even as more information comes to light, combined with the\nfruitless searches, means all that\u2019s left are theories of what might have\nhappened to the flight \u2013 and some are more plausible than others.\nSome theories have been dismissed by authorities, but others loom large.\nA theory considered by the Malaysian government and the Australian Transport\nSafety Bureau is that the passengers and crew of MH370 were  incapacitated by\nan oxygen deficiency.\nThey speculated that everyone on the plane, including its captain, Zaharie\nAhmad Shah, somehow fell unconscious. The plane would have been on autopilot\nuntil it ran out of fuel, then crashed into the sea.\nVersions of this theory include a hijacking in which someone damaged the\noxygen supply, or an accident that harmed the plane\u2019s mechanics and affected\nits oxygen levels.\nIn  another version of this theory \u2013 described by a team of analysts on the\nAustralian news program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2013 Shah was the only one awake, and in a\nsuicidal state he disabled communication before steering the plane into the\nocean.\nOthers have posited the theory that a pilot deliberately crashed the plane. A\nCanadian aviation expert and former airplane-crash investigator  told Canada\u2019s\nCBC News in May 2018 that he was certain it was a murder-suicide by a pilot.\nBut the July 2018 report offered evidence against the idea that it was a\ndeliberate act by the crew.\nThe 495-page document said neither the pilot nor the first officer showed\npsychological signs suggesting they could have deliberately crashed the plane.\nIt said that among the crew members, \u201cthere were no behavioral signs of social\nisolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse.\u201d\nInvestigators also said the crew members\u2019 movements captured on CCTV before\nthe flight and their voices on air-traffic-control recordings did not seem any\ndifferent from how they were on previous flights.\nKok Soo Chon, the lead investigator, told reporters at a press conference\nabout the report that the crew exhibited \u201cno anxiety or stress.\u201d He said that\nwhile the report was \u201cnot ruling out anything,\u201d it found plenty of evidence\nagainst the suicide theory.\n_**Read more:** The new MH370 report rejects the most horrific theory of all\nabout why the plane disappeared_\nChristopher Goodfellow, a former pilot,  has speculated that an electrical\nfire on the plane led pilots to turn it back toward Malaysia to find an\nemergency landing strip. He said the plane would have flown on autopilot as\nthe fire incapacitated the crew and passengers.\nBut another pilot, Patrick Smith,  said it would have been unlikely that the\nplane would travel for hours on autopilot after a fire. Other evidence against\nthat theory is that the plane also turned again after heading toward Malaysia.\nSmith told Business Insider in 2015 that the nature of the debris found also\nmight suggest the plane was under control when it crashed.\n![](/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg)\nThe plane might have landed gently in the water and  sunk in mostly one piece.\nExperts have said this theory is consistent with the debris found.\nAnother theory is that the search was in the wrong area and that investigators\nshould be looking north of Malaysia \u2013 perhaps the plane crashed, or perhaps it\nlanded and was hidden somewhere. But that was  rejected by Inmarsat, the\nBritish company that owned and operated the satellite that tracked MH370 until\nit dropped off the network.\nThe July 2018 report  pushed back on a theory that batteries and fruit in the\nplane\u2019s cargo had somehow formed an explosive mixture that brought down the\nplane.\n_**Read more:** The new MH370 report quashed a wild theory that the plane\u2019s\ncargo of fruit and batteries turned it into a giant, flying bomb_\nOther theories are that the plane was taken over remotely in a bid to foil a\nhijacking.

The 2018 report said there was no technology on the plane\nthat would allow control to be taken from the pilots remotely.\nDetails that emerged in early reports on the plane\u2019s disappearance \u2013 including\nthat two people  boarded with stolen passports and that no one seemed clear\nwhether everyone had boarded the plane \u2013 helped conspiracy theories swirl.\nConflicting accounts from officials and affected families  accusing the\nMalaysian government of withholding information added fuel.\nMore outlandish theories include a remote cyber-hijacking, the plane being\nshot down by perhaps the US military, the idea that Russian President Vladimir\nPutin knows the plane\u2019s location, a mystery extra passenger taking control of\nthe plane, a Bermuda Triangle-style area causing the plane\u2019s disappearance,\nand North Korea taking the plane.\nOther theories blame the CIA, Israel, and aliens \u2013 all traditional bogeymen\nfor conspiracy theorists.\nDespite the efforts of one of the  largest and most expensive searches, so\nmuch information remains unknown.\n![](/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg)\nIf the plane\u2019s route were to be established by a future investigation or the\nplane itself were to be found, it could provide clues about whether it was\ndeliberately heading somewhere, or whether there was an accident like a loss\nof oxygen.\nWe also don\u2019t know which of the pilots was flying the plane when it\ndisappeared, or whether it was someone else.\nIt may be that even if the plane is found, these questions would remain\nunanswered.\nRelatives of the passengers and crew members had pinned their hopes on the\nMalaysian government\u2019s latest report.

This gave the Leave side 52%, compared with 48% for\nRemain.\nThe EU is an economic and political union involving 28 European countries. It\nallows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without\nany checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to\nlive and work in whichever country they choose.\nThe UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community)\nand it will be the first member state to withdraw.\nThe UK formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, but there is still a lot to\ntalk about and months of negotiation to come.\nWhile the UK has agreed the terms of its EU departure, both sides still need\nto decide what their future relationship will look like.\nThis will need to be worked out during the transition period (which some\nprefer to call the implementation period), which began immediately after\nBrexit day and is due to end on 31 December 2020.\nDuring this 11-month period, the UK will continue to follow all of the EU's\nrules and its trading relationship will remain the same.\nThe transition period is meant to give both sides some breathing space while\na new free trade agreement is negotiated.\nThis is needed because the UK will leave the single market and customs union\nat the end of the transition. A free trade agreement will allow goods to move\naround the EU without checks or extra charges.\nIf a new one cannot be agreed in time, then the UK faces the prospect of\nhaving to trade with no deal in place. That would mean tariffs (taxes) on UK\ngoods travelling to the EU and other trade barriers.\nAside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will\nalso need to be decided. For example:\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists the transition period will not be\nextended, but the European Commission has warned that the timetable will be\nextremely challenging.\nThe transition period and other aspects of the UK's departure were agreed in a\ndeal called the withdrawal agreement.\nMost of that was negotiated by Theresa May's government. But after Mr Johnson\nreplaced her in July 2019, he negotiated some changes to it.\nPlease upgrade your browser\nUse the list below or select a button\nThe key change is that under Mr Johnson's deal, a customs border will\neffectively be created between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Some goods\nentering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be subject to checks and\nwill have to pay EU import taxes (known as tariffs).\nThese would be refunded if goods remain in Northern Ireland (ie are not moved\nto the Republic of Ireland).\nThe rest of the withdrawal agreement is largely unchanged from the one\nnegotiated by Mrs May. This includes:\nBrexit was originally meant to happen on 29 March 2019, but the deadline was\ndelayed twice after MPs rejected the deal negotiated by Mrs May, the prime\nminister at the time.\nAfter MPs voted down the deal for a third time, Mrs May resigned.\nMr Johnson needed a Brexit extension of his own after MPs failed to get the\nrevised deal passed into law.\nThis led to the new deadline of 31 January 2020.\nMr Johnson then called an early general election, to which MPs agreed.\nThe election, which happened on 12 December 2019, resulted in a Conservative\nmajority of 80.\nWith a sizeable majority in Parliament, it proved straightforward to pass the\nBrexit legislation.\n **What questions do you have about Brexit and the future?**\n ** _In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age\nand location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Never really got your head around it in the\nfirst place? Let us walk you through it.\nBrexit is short for \"British exit\" - and is the word people use to talk about\nthe United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU).\nThe EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each\nother and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work\n(click here if you want to see the full list).\nThe UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in\n1973.\nA public vote - called **a referendum** \\- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016\nwhen voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or\nremain in the European Union.\nThe Leave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m \\- but the exit\ndidn't happen straight away.\nIt was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been\ndelayed (we will explain in more detail below).\nThe 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking\nplace between the UK and the other EU countries.\nThe discussions have been mainly over the \"divorce\" deal, which sets out\nexactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards.\nThis deal is known as the **Withdrawal Agreement** _._\nThe withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points:\nIt also includes a **transition period,** which has been agreed to allow the\nUK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust.\nThat means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will\nbe no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020.\nAnother, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview\nof what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term.\nThis is the **political declaration** _._ However, neither side has to stick\nexactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks.\nThe deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to\nbe approved by British MPs.\nWell, no. They have voted against it three times.\nOn 15 January they rejected the deal by 432 votes to 202 \\- a record defeat.\nThen on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had\ngone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances, they rejected it\nagain.\nAnd on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU - MPs\nrejected it for a third time (this vote was slightly different as it did not\ninclude the political declaration).\nYes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask\nother EU leaders to delay Brexit.\nThe deadline was delayed until 31 October \\- but, unable to see a way forward,\nMrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson.\nThere is a broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to\ngive back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU.\nOne of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish\nborder.\nBoth the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's\nwhy), so something called **the backstop** \\- a sort of safety net - was\nincluded in the deal.\nThe backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island\nof Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations.\nIt would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still\nfollow some EU rules on things such as food products.\nTheresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used.\nBut it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to\nend it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for\ngood.\nOther MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it.\nAnd others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest\nof the UK.\nBoris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with\nthe EU - and remove the backstop.\nIf he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before\nbeing passed into UK law.\nHowever, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the\nwithdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal.\nIf the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal\nagreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31\nOctober.\nLeaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a \"no-deal\nBrexit\".\n\"No deal\" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement.\nIt would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU\nlaws would stop applying to the UK immediately (more on that here).\nThe government says it is preparing for this potential situation.\nIt expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could\ncost businesses billions of pounds. (Read the government's report here).\nIt has published a series of guides \\- which cover everything from mobile\nroaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies.\nHere is a list of 10 ways you could be affected by a no-deal Brexit.\nIt is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the\ndeadline has shifted.\nThe European Court of Justice has said the UK could cancel Brexit altogether\nwithout the agreement of other nations \\- but few politicians publicly back\nthis option.\nTwo million flights are cancelled as airlines are hit by plummeting demand and\nask for bailouts.\nHave you been getting these songs wrong?\nWhat happens to your body in extreme heat?\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.businessinsider.sg/peoples-vote-campaign-says-brexit-referendum-crunch-point-is-coming-2019-1", "content": "\nLONDON \u2013 The defeat this week of a series of amendments designed to\npotentially delay Brexit has led some commentators to suggest that the anti-\nBrexit campaign for a second referendum  is now dead.\nHowever, campaigners for a People\u2019s Votes still believe that the \u201ccrunch\npoint\u201d for forcing a new referendum still lies ahead, with the \u201cremorseless\nlogic\u201d of the Brexit process still pointing towards another public vote.\nMPs and activists who support the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a new referendum\nwere deflated this week after MPs rejected amendments designed to delay Brexit\nand allow discussions of alternatives to Theresa May\u2019s deal.\nSome MPs were also disappointed that the campaign didn\u2019t push for an amendment\nto be tabled in its name.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a grassroots push at every chance,\u201d an MP who backs the\ncampaign told Business Insider this week. \u201cWe can\u2019t be put off by being\nknocked back.

Stefan\nRousseau/PA Images via Getty Images\nThere was growing anxiety among pro-People's Vote Labour MPs this week that\ntheir leader Jeremy Corbyn is close to throwing his support behind a revised\nversion of May's deal with the EU.\nCorbyn and his closest advisors met with May and government figures this week\nto discuss what the prime minister could do to win Labour's support, primarily\nLabour policy of a permanent customs union.\nThe government is also trying to lure Labour MPs with promises to maintain EU-\nlevels of workers' rights after Brexit and cash injections for Leave-voting\nconstituencies in deprived regions on the country.\n\"There's a real foreboding sense of Corbyn wanting to deliver a compromise\nBrexit at some point in the next few weeks,\" one Labour MP and former shadow\nminister told BI.\nThey added: \"And MPs who aren't the usual suspects are saying in WhatsApp\ngroups that the backlash to supporting a People's Vote will be nothing\ncompared to that of facilitating a Tory Brexit.\n\"There's probably more chance of getting her [May] to back a People's Vote\nthan Corbyn right now.\"\nLabour's official policy is to consider supporting a public vote if their\npreferred outcomes of an early general election or forcing May into accepting\nLabour's alternative Brexit plan cannot be achieved.\nHowever, Corbyn's office is reluctant to back a referendum and would rather\ndeliver a revised Brexit deal.\nThe Labour leadership claims to have conducted polling which shows that there\nis little appetite for a new referendum among the voters that Labour must\nattract in order to win a majority at the next election, BI reported.\n\"I could see a scenario where May comes back with a slightly softer deal and\nwe say 'well that is the best we can do'.\" a senior aide to Corbyn told BI\nbefore Christmas.\n\"That nearly meets our objectives' and then we will try to renegotiate in\noffice.

The trouble is this crisis and\ngovernment\u2019s response to it are moving so fast that people are being left\nconfused and disoriented. I can\u2019t answer all the questions but will try to\nhelp where I can. I\u2019ve been especially busy helping constituents to interpret\nthe advice and instructions given by ministers and posted online (gov.uk).\nNaturally grey areas remain when rules are drawn up fast. Talking through\nindividual situations can often help to find a common sense solution\nespecially as I\u2019ve been in on the statements in the Commons and elsewhere in\nwhich ministers have elaborated on what they are requiring us to do.\nGiven that in a matter of days government has had to design a whole new\nwelfare and economic support structure, re-engineer the NHS to cope with the\nCOVID-19, recruit an army of volunteers and ensure that we have the means to\nensure resilience meaning society does not break down if this get a lot worse,\nit is hardly surprising there have been a few bumps along the way.\nFortunately, I think the confusion over work is now being dispelled. It\u2019s a\npity a distinction between \u2018essential\u2019 and, by implication, non-essential work\nhas been allowed to cause so much uncertainty. The gov.uk website makes clear\nthat if you\u2019re not isolating you can work, preferably from home but if that\u2019s\nnot possible you should maintain social distancing in the workplace. Employers\nare responsible for facilitating it. Where it\u2019s not possible they are shutting\nup shop, sometimes literally in the case of builders merchants for example,\none of which contacted me recently prompting a reference by me in the Commons\nearlier in the week.\nI have been contacted by tourists stranded abroad by the crisis who want\ngovernment to get them home. I do feel for them. Having served at the foreign\noffice recently I know the consular service will be doing its very best in\ncountry and in London, accepting that its diplomats too will be in various\nforms of lockdown, home working or sickness (we sadly lost a diplomat to\ncoronavirus this week). The foreign secretary, who made a statement on Tuesday\nin the House which is available online, is trying to facilitate safe return\nalong with his counterparts in similarly affected countries. Importantly he\u2019s\ntrying to unblock hub airports whose closure has meant long haul flights are\ncurrently not happening. However, it would be good if people, however\nfrustrated, avoid the temptation to take it out on officials - and MPs\u2019\noffices. We\u2019ve had some unpleasant emails here, sadly. Government, whose main\npriority right now is ensuring citizens are safe and well, at home and abroad\nis, along with other countries, trying to get UK citizens back.\nI would be careful in interpreting the interesting Oxford study which purports\nto show that the virus is much more prevalent in society than we thought. The\nimplication being, of course, that it\u2019s less lethal than we thought since\nlegions of subclinically infected would greatly increase the numerator in the\nmortality rate calculation, the denominator (the number of dead people) being\naccurately know, obviously. We have to proceed on the basis of the Imperial\nCollege paper from a couple of weeks ago which predicted that if the current\nmeasures were not put in place we would be facing a quarter of a million\ndeaths and a completely overwhelmed health service.\nThe good news is that in two or three weeks with the antibody test we should\nknow which, Oxford or ICL, is closest to the mark. That will have quite\ndramatic implications for lifting lockdowns, flattening curves etc. Bring it\non!\n\n\n**24 March 2020**\nEverything\u2019s changed. Yesterday I took part in the second reading debate of a\npiece of legislation the like of which I never imagined in this country. The\nCoronavirus Bill is a horror that will revolt all freedom loving citizens, all\nwho hold our hard won liberties dear and all who love our western liberal\ndemocracy and way of life - but it and the PM\u2019s broadcast last night are\nnecessary responses to the dire circumstances we face.\nI\u2019m amazed at the bovine stupidity of people crowding together in public\nplaces over the weekend. Please, everyone, comply with advice, which as of\nyesterday are instructions. Make sure you stay home, go out only when strictly\nnecessary and stay at least two metres from those not in your household. Read\nthe coronavirus advice on the gov.uk website. Wiltshire Council\u2019s page\n_www.wiltshire.gov.uk/public-health-coronavirus_ is useful too.\nI have been in demand by the national media who want a medic MP to opine on\nthe current situation. There are a number of doctors in the House but I think\nI\u2019m the only one with a qualification in public health so people think I might\nhave a special insight into what\u2019s going on. The trouble is this is a novel\ncoronavirus which means we\u2019re learning about its behaviour and epidemiology\nall the time. That makes predictions very difficult and strategy for dealing\nwith it even more so.\nMy mailbag has exploded as constituents contact me worried about coronavirus\nand the consequences of the public health measures the government has had to\ntake. I hope many of the concerns have been addressed by last week\u2019s\nextraordinary money pledges by the Chancellor. There is though still work to\nbe done to protect the self employed and I expect further measures shortly.\nI am socially distancing like mad. However, it is right that MPs should be\npresent in the Commons at a time of crisis like this. I take my duties to\nrepresent my constituents here and hold the government to account very\nseriously. On Monday I took part in the Coronavirus Bill debate asking about\nthe support of returning healthcare workers, urging what has become known as\nlockdown and raising the delayed appearance of personal protective equipment\nin care settings. The latter followed concerns raised by the Leader of\nWiltshire Council and discussion with my Wiltshire MP colleagues and was\nfollowed by a conversation with the council leader, officials at county hall\nand the national coordinating PPE helpline. I will work on this some more\ntoday. This virus is already in our care settings. It\u2019s vital we protect key\nworkers at the care frontline as it extends its grip.\nOn PPE my understanding is the NHS is being prioritised but that sufficient\nmasks etc are available too for care settings. The issue apparently is getting\nthem to the right places. There are also, I understand, fears that we will get\nthrough stocks quickly although with China, the major producer, now coming out\nof lockdown supply should constraints should ease. I am told that we are\nbetter placed than many countries because we had already been stockpiling\nagainst the possibility of a serious seasonal flu epidemic and, of course,\nBrexit. For the future we need to ensure that we can generate more stuff at\nhome and be less reliant on imports. This is particularly true of vaccines.\nThe U.K. leads the world in vaccine research and development yet we have very\nlittle manufacturing capacity. One of the lessons of this outbreak is that we\nhave to be able to make vaccine here in sufficient quantities for healthcare\nworkers and at risk groups. When a vaccine or the drugs to treat COVID-19\nemerge, I want the UK to be at the front, not back, of the line. I raised this\npoint in the House last week.\nI\u2019m still a Navy Reservist so liable to be called up. Last time was under very\ndifferent circumstances - the 2003 Iraq war. I\u2019ve contacted my Navy bosses to\nsay I\u2019m available immediately, conscious that my medical skills, such as they\nare, could be useful. I suspect Parliament won\u2019t be returning immediately\nafter the Easter recess so I\u2019ve no doubt MPs will be volunteering to help\nwherever they can.\nWe will get through this. But I suspect there will be several months of\nrestrictions, perhaps eased a bit in some parts of the country from time to\ntime. Drugs to treat COVID-19 will emerge, either repurposed ones or new\nretrovirals. We will be able to test people for antibodies to the virus\nmeaning key workers then people more generally will be able to move about\nmore. Finally, we will have a vaccine.\nMeanwhile, mud slinging has begun in earnest. Who\u2019s to blame? Why weren\u2019t\nactions taken sooner? Where\u2019s the personal protective equipment? Leading the\nchange, need you ask, the good old BBC. Oh yes, the Corporation\u2019s curled upper\nlip brigade is on the march again. Evidently this now extends to its little\nplatoons, local radio.\nNow, there will come a time when we have to examine, formally and\ndeliberatively, decisions made and actions taken, or not taken. Now is not\nthat time. But that didn\u2019t stop BBC Radio Wiltshire, for goodness sake,\ngrandstanding this morning with me trying to get public health messages across\naround staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives. Off the glib\ntongue of our young BBC sage tripped the same old stuff; who\u2019s to blame for a\ncrisis apparently due to \u2018vast NHS cuts,\u2019 too little too late and failure to\nprovide equipment. Well, BBC Radio Wiltshire - with its existentially low\nlistener figures - needs to decide whether its in the business of peddling\ntabloid cynicism about those doing their level best in a crisis or help\nmitigate the effects of an impending public health catastrophe that will carry\noff a significant number of our elderly neighbours. I phoned the editor to\ndraw stumps - after 20 years of appearing on BBC Radio Wiltshire he won\u2019t be\ngetting me on his station again. I\u2019ve advised my MP colleagues to give him the\ncold shoulder too. There are other ways of getting our messages across these\ndays, better ways of engaging with the public.\nAs we progress through this particular emergency we need to be conscious that\nanother will likely, at some point, follow. The pity is that the lessons of\nthe SARS epidemic in 2003 and subsequent outbreaks were not absorbed fully by\nthe global community. These bugs are global security threats that far exceed\nother forms, for example terrorism. Next time we may be faced with an even\nmore infectious, more deadly pathogen. Our defences must start to be built\nnow.\nWiltshire Council and the Local Resilience Forum are working hard in the\ncommunity. They, with town and parish councils, are coordinating effort to\nensure people are looked after as best they can. What can we do as\nindividuals? Well, good neighbours have never been more important. Please\nphone or text people you know who may be isolating or isolated. Sometimes a\nsimple call can make all the difference.\nAbove all my friends, PLEASE stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.\nGod bless.\n\n\n**12 March 2020**\n **Keep calm and carry on**\nIt is all about coronavirus.\nAs I write, governments are having to close things down in a way that is\nunprecedented outside wartime. Even in our own stiff upper lip capital city\npublic transport seems strangely quiet.\nIt\u2019ll get worse here folks, but I\u2019m guessing the disruption will be relatively\nshort term \u2013 maybe weeks not months - but I can\u2019t be sure. All we can do is\nkeep calm and carry on. We will get through this and our ability to deal with\nfuture, possibly even nastier, epidemics will emerge stronger than before.\nIt was the Coronavirus Budget with \u00a330BN (for starters) signed off for dealing\nwith the consequences of COVID19. As I write we\u2019re about to enter the second,\nso-called Delay, phase of what is now officially a pandemic.\nHave we left it too late? Time will tell but I don\u2019t think so. If we close\nthings down too soon, people\u2019s tolerance to the restrictions will wear off.\nWe\u2019re not China - our western liberal democracies are poorly suited to the\nkind of authoritarian measures Beijing is able to take. And once the boot\nslips from the carotid of this disease it\u2019ll likely whip back and bite, hard.\nHence the strategy being pursued, on advice, by ministers. I agree with it.\nIn my view, so far, the government has been very surefooted with Health\nSecretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty impressing\nparticularly. Admittedly its early days but a balanced, measured, evidence-\nbased approach to coronavirus, getting Brexit done and now a well-received\nbudget has propelled the governing party to new highs in the opinion polls.\nIt\u2019s good that the public has confidence in the administration at this time\nbut equally the Speaker is right to insist on the importance of keeping\nParliament open so ministers can be held to account.\nAs my constituents would expect, I\u2019ve been speaking quite a lot about\ncoronavirus in the Commons and in the national media. In my last days a\nforeign office minister I attended one of the very first COBRA coronavirus\nmeetings. I think I\u2019m right in saying I\u2019m the only MP with a postgrad\nqualification in public health and will certainly be rolling up my sleeves if\nand when we move into the Mitigate phase with its need for extra medical staff\non the frontline. Meantime, I\u2019m washing my hands with a ferocity I haven\u2019t\nknown since working in operating theatres!\nIt\u2019s too early to play the blame game. However, although China\u2019s speed in\ndealing with its crisis, once acknowledged, has been truly remarkable, it was\nslow to come clean with the global community. Had it been more up front we\nwould all have had more time to prepare.\nWe now have to live with the consequences.\nChina is seeking to insert itself across the world dominating, for example,\ntrade and infrastructure in swathes of Africa. Well, this crisis and the way\nBeijing has conducted itself has dented credentials it may have been nurturing\nas an open, cooperative and trustworthy global citizen. Though not directly\nrelevant, the atmospherics are likely to impact on the way we view things like\nHuawei and 5G, a very live debate.\nWe can\u2019t just rely on vigorous hand washing and appropriate social distancing\nto deal with coronavirus. Looking to the past for clues to how this pandemic\nwill unfold we have to move at pace to find a vaccine or vaccines and\nsupportive pharmaceuticals, mainly repurposed existing drugs. That will mean\nwe can whack this bug on the head more definitively later in the year or early\nnext. In 1918/19 it was the second phase of Spanish flu that did the damage. A\nhundred years later we need to be ready for something similar. However,\nthere\u2019s a limit to how much we can short-circuit clinical trials and expedite\nthe licensing process. That\u2019s because mortality from COVID19 is relatively low\nmeaning appetite for serious side effects is far less than in, for example,\nEbola.\nIn the UK we\u2019re great at research but our ability to make vaccine is quite\npoor. So, it\u2019s all very well pumping money into research but if factories in\nother countries then make the vaccines we can be sure those countries will\nappropriate early batches for their own publics. The UK government would be\npunished if it had not ensured we had vaccine when it becomes available, at\nleast to protect key workers and the most vulnerable. For this outbreak and\nany future, possibly worse epidemics, we must grow our own means of\nproduction. Without that there is a clear national security risk. If I had a\ncriticism of government, it would be that it isn\u2019t appearing to approach\nindigenous manufacture with sufficient alacrity. I\u2019ll continue to argue the\nimportance of growing it at pace.\nRishi Sunak\u2019s first budget has propelled him to undisputed wunderkind status.\nI confess to being agnostic on HS2 but am generally in favour of big\ninfrastructure projects \u2013 true investments that can be legitimately borne on\nthe public balance sheet. That\u2019s part of Boris\u2019 appeal. I\u2019m definitely pleased\nwith the intent signalled on Wednesday to get on with the dualling of the A303\nwhich will please my constituents \u2013 though after so many years they\u2019ll reserve\njudgement until the first sod is actually cut.\nThe new Chancellor did rather (and quite adroitly) skate over social care.\nEvidently it\u2019s still firmly in the all too difficult box and the spending\nsplurge on Wednesday means there will be even less cash to ease in a fairer\nmechanism for delivering adult social care. However, he\u2019ll have to come up\nwith something more concrete next time he presents his budget.\nLots of good green commitments in the budget. I note the extra cash for\nimproving air quality and local road schemes. I look forward to Westbury in\nparticular benefitting and will be exploring with stakeholders how we can\nexploit lines in the budget for improving the local environment. This means a\nwestern bypass taking traffic out of the middle of Westbury and routing it\nthrough the business district on that side of town.\n\n\n**28 February 2020**\nI\u2019m conscious I haven\u2019t posted much recently. Been a bit busy - rather a lot\nhas happened! I\u2019m now back on the backbench which is fine as I always said my\nfirst duty was to my constituents.\nWe\u2019ve left the EU. That was the clear instruction of the voters in December\nand it\u2019s done. To the distress, I\u2019m guessing, of those who are still not\nreconciled with Brexit, the sky hasn\u2019t fallen in and there\u2019s been no plague of\nfrogs and locusts. In fact the economy continues to outperform continental\nEurope, there\u2019s a record number of full time jobs and real wages are rising.\nBut no complacency. An EU bureaucracy spurned will not bust a gut to be\nhelpful in crafting a follow-on free trade agreement. Those who say it\u2019s\nobviously in the EU\u2019s commercial interests to do a deal miss the point.\nBrussels is all about advancing Brussels, that is to say the edifice of the\nEU, not the daily lived experience of Europeans. If the U.K. is seen to\nthrive, other member states with serious doubts about the outfit may be\nemboldened. And that would never do.\nSo, expect a fairly peppery few months as we work through the Implementation\nPeriod.\nIn other news, I\u2019ve been talking quite a lot in the Commons and elsewhere\nabout coronavirus. I think I\u2019m the only MP with a postgrad qualification in\npublic health but as this is a novel virus that hardly helps. I\u2019ve been\nfollowing this nasty little bug closely both when I was a foreign office\nminister and since. It seems to me that it has the potential to cause very\nserious mischief, both in terms of mortality and morbidity worldwide and\neconomically. However, building on experience of SARS, MERS and swine flu, our\nNHS and public health systems are relatively well equipped to cope. We can be\nless sure about countries with poorly developed healthcare systems and where\nextreme poverty means people are more susceptible.\nI\u2019m mystified by talk of promoting another Melksham bypass before dealing with\nWestbury. Let\u2019s be clear, Westbury has a big air pollution problem, Melksham\ndoesn\u2019t. Anyone can see the traffic problem in Westbury is acute. It really\nisn\u2019t of anything like the same order in Melksham. Onto it.\nLooking forward to the upcoming budget and arguing for our fair share of\ninfrastructure funding locally. Have been in touch with ministerial colleagues\nand others about roads - A303, A36 and, obvs, A350 through Westbury - and\nlocal SEND provision particularly.\n\n\n**21 October 2019**\n\u2018Super\u2019 Saturday\n![Brexit](/sites/www.andrewmurrison.co.uk/files/inline-\nimages/brexit%20parliament.uk_.jpg) ****\nWhat an utter waste of time and \u00a358.20 of taxpayers\u2019 money for a standard\nreturn ticket to London.\nIn my view, Prime Minister Johnson made a truly outstanding opening speech -\ngracious, generous, compelling. Please look it up, and of course the Leader of\nthe Opposition\u2019s, by googling Hansard.\nIn sharp and grating contrast, our miserable, disingenuous, conniving\nparliament once again ratted on its duty to represent the long suffering\npublic it purports to serve. This has been the problem throughout - a Remain\nparliament pretending to execute the instructions of a country that voted\nLeave.\nThe solution isn\u2019t another referendum - look at the contempt Parliament showed\nfor the first one and for the \u2018wrong\u2019 result it delivered. No, the answer is a\ngeneral election. All those MPs in Leave voting seats who once again today\ntrooped through the Remain lobby will then have the opportunity to explain\nthemselves on the doorstep. Good luck with that. Those who are standing down\nin any event and thus free agents will have plenty of time to reflect on their\nlegacy - this horrible divisive business going on and on sucking all the\noxygen out of politics and public affairs.\nIf you\u2019re still tempted by the prospect of another 6 months of this, and\nprobably worse, whilst we have a second referendum take a look at the\naggression of the Remain mob on Saturday. I\u2019ve had to put up with being bawled\nand hollered at on my way into the Commons and into government buildings along\nWhitehall for many months now but we\u2019ve reached a sorry pass when MPs walking\nhome have to be protected by a phalanx of police officers.\nInterestingly the strongly pro Brexit DUP has decided to oppose the deal. I\u2019m\na former NI minister and until I returned to the front bench in May I had the\nhonour and privilege of chairing the NI select committee. I remain a keen\nobserver of NI matters and have a deep and abiding affection for the people of\nthat fair corner of the British Isles. What I would say to my good unionist\nfriends is this. Demographic change means there may well come a time when, in\naccordance with the Good Friday Agreement, there will be a case for a border\npoll to determine if NI leaves the UK and joins the Irish Republic, or not.\nBeing NI, opinion will likely split down sectarian lines but superimposed on\nthis will be the perception that life for people and families is better or\nworse on one side of the border or the other. In other words on how NI is\ndoing economically and socially compared with the Republic, and by extension\nthe EU. Until fairly recently this was something of a no brainer. However, an\nunexpected increase in social liberality and economic advance has made the\nRepublic a more enticing proposition.\nBoris\u2019 deal appears to offer NI the best of both worlds. In my view the key to\nkeeping NI in the UK isn\u2019t the absence of a few more checks on goods crossing\nthe Irish Sea but increased economic prosperity for people living there.\nBoris\u2019 deal makes this more likely.\nThe so-called Letwin amendment today was, in my judgement, simply an attempt\nto delay the deal Remain MPs thought Boris would never get in order to\ngenerate more opportunity for overturning Brexit altogether.\nOf course the Opposition is rubbing its hands. In an attempt to construct a\nnarrative beyond opportunism, Her Majesty\u2019s Loyal Opposition seems to be\narguing that the Boris deal threatens human and animal rights and environment\nstandards. We hear from its leaders that the deal is a \u2018Trump Brexit\u2019 aimed,\napparently, at privatising the NHS. The logic, so far as I can see any, is\nthat the UK needs the EU as protection from trashing its own standards, rules,\nregulations and institutions. But any government would and could tinker with\nthese things only if it had a mandate. It seems a tad unlikely that the people\nof this country would vote to deny themselves rights, destroy the environment\nand sell off the NHS at a general election. We\u2019re also at risk of overlooking\nthe fact that it has often been the UK driving up EU standards, often in the\nteeth of opposition from other member states. Indeed, if we are to be\nconcerned about falling standards after Brexit, we might worry, as well-\nmeaning neighbours, for the EU rather than the UK since, given our record,\nit\u2019s standards in the EU going forward, not the UK, that look to be at risk.\nI can\u2019t accurately predict where all this is going but I do expect more\nshenanigans next week. Although I have every confidence in the PM who did a\nfantastic job getting a better deal from Brussels, my expectations of this\nthoroughly rotten parliament are very low.\nIt\u2019s time we saw the back of it. We need a general election.\nPronto.\n\n\n**27 September 2019**\nSo, Parliament resumed this week to no good effect. Just more of the same.\nExpecting more of it next week.\nOn the Supreme Court ruling, we should reflect on the new law that has just\nbeen created and the impact it has on our constitutional arrangements. I\naccept the ruling, as I\u2019m bound to do, but I don\u2019t agree with the SC and\nneither evidently does the Master of the Rolls, Lord Chief Justice, the Law\nOfficers or the judges of the lower court. On that basis the PM was entitled\nto believe it was perfectly in order to prorogue parliament after the longest\nsession in living memory and, as is customary, before a Queen\u2019s Speech setting\nout a new programme for government.\nIt has been lost on many that we were due to be in recess in any event for\nmuch of the prorogation because of the traditional conference season. Labour\nand Lib Dem\u2019s had theirs earlier this month then yesterday in an act of pure\nspite voted to spike the Conservative event in Manchester.\nSo much for a new kinder politics.\nAs the Attorney General has said, it looks like the unexpected SC ruling has\nset us on a path to a more politicised judiciary involving, ultimately, US\nstyle confirmatory hearings in Parliament in the interest of full\ntransparency. Indeed, it would be naive to expect the status quo to endure\nafter such an important shift in our arrangements.\nOn language, I would always encourage temperance. However, I was appalled by\nthe confected outrage at the PM\u2019s oratory on Wednesday. The poor man had just\ngot off the red eye from New York, where we had both been flying the flag for\nthe U.K. at the United Nations General Assembly, to be faced with contorted,\nspittle-flecked vitriol from Her Majesty\u2019s charming Opposition. If you doubt\nit rerun the footage available online.\nI\u2019m bemused, but not for the first time, by the Bishops of the Established\nChurch who have all chimed in on this language bandwagon. Apparently they\nconsider references made by Boris to things like the \u2018Surrender Bill\u2019\noffensive and likely to encourage violence. But I haven\u2019t heard a squeak from\nthem when opposition politicians talk routinely about lynching or decapitating\nMr Johnson.\nThe fact is that the Bill in question does surrender an important card in any\nnegotiation - the ability to walk away. Who would unilaterally do that? Only\nthose who want to frustrate Brexit but are unwilling to say so in plain terms\nfor fear of upsetting their voters. Most, but not all, of them are the very\nsame people who refuse to back a General Election. Their cunning ruse is to\npile on the agony, dragging it out, in the hope that it will increase the\nchances of the government being associated with chaos and ultimately being\ndefeated.\nIn my opinion, the prospect of an avowed Marxist and Maoist as PM and\nChancellor is a thousand times worse than anything on the Brexit spectrum for\nboth the U.K. and its neighbours.\nI just hope that at the EU Summit on 17 October our European partners come to\ntheir senses and offer something that stands a chance of peeling off\nsufficient moderates in the Commons from the entrenched extremes, party\npolitical perceived interests and the ranks of the dispossessed and\ndisaffected to get this done. Otherwise this will continue to be a running\nsore indefinitely, sapping political energy, trashing the UK\u2019s reputation and\nleaching business confidence.\nI want to leave with a deal that delivers on the referendum and allows the\nU.K. to flourish as cordial and a cooperative neighbour with EU member states\nand with countries across the world. I want a deal that enables the U.K. to be\na sovereign state again and not sucked into \u2018ever closer union\u2019 and a Guy\nVerhofstadt style European federation that is now generally accepted as being\nwhere the EU is heading.\nSo does Boris.\nWe find ourselves in a Remain dominated parliament with a Remain Speaker and\nmetropolitan institutions that are sympathetic to Remain. But there\u2019s a fly in\ntheir ointment - the public. They are the masters, not us, they have spoken\nand they expect the establishment to bend to their will.\nI will continue to do all in my power to ensure it does.\n\n\n**13 September 2019**\nI\u2019ve been doing quite a lot of traveling over the summer and conference\nrecesses in my capacity as a Foreign Office minister. There\u2019s a lot of\ninterest overseas in Brexit and I\u2019m forever being asked what\u2019s going on.\nRight now I\u2019m in Geneva, a very European but distinctively non E.U. country.\nIt looks pretty good to me.\nI\u2019d say that some of the language around the deal, or a deal, coming from key\ncapitals is beginning to sound a bit more positive.\nWe have also seen the emergence of a cross party group of MPs who appear to be\nsuggesting that they may now support a deal that looks a bit like the one they\nvoted against three times when Mrs May introduced it. Had they done so then we\nwould now be out of the E.U. and getting on with our new relationships, with\nEuropean countries and others. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing a better deal\nwith the more problematic bits deleted or dialed down, especially on the\nNorthern Ireland so-called backstop. Hopefully enough MPs will see sense and\nback it so we can all move on.\nThere should be a path back for the 21 so-called rebels who have had the whip\nwithdrawn and are thus technically no longer Tory MPs - but they have to\nrecognize the will of the people expressed at the referendum and stop blocking\nBrexit. They must surely recognize the greater danger which, in my view, is\nthe Leader of the Opposition in Downing Street.\nWhat approaches hysteria about the potential impact of no deal on their part\nand their inability to accept that a negotiator never removes the threat of\nwalking away (even if he doesn\u2019t intend to) are playing into the hands of\npeople they have spent their political lives trying to deny the keys of Number\nTen.\n\n\n**4 September 2019**\nThe stated purpose of the Bill passed through the Commons today is stop the UK\nleaving the EU without a deal on 31 Oct 19. It\u2019s actual purpose is to stop the\nUK leaving at all. The reason for the subterfuge is that MPs don\u2019t want to be\nseen to negate the majority view of the public expressed at the referendum,\nespecially those representing heavily Leave seats.\nMeanwhile Mr Corbyn baulked at the offer by Boris Johnson to go head to head\nat a general election, thus becoming the first Leader of the Opposition to\nturn down a punt at becoming PM. Clearly he doesn\u2019t fancy his chances of\nwinning right now. What he wants of course is for Brexit to fail, for the\ngovernment to be blamed and for him then to hoover up the votes.\nIn my view Boris was right to take the whip from MPs who were not prepared to\nback him on this central issue of the day. We have to get Brexit done. It\nwould be nigh on impossible and certainly undesirable to have candidates at\nthe upcoming election who could not back a manifesto that will have Brexit as\nits centrepiece. I\u2019m sorry if that seems harsh but that\u2019s politics for you.\nSo, tonight the prospect of no deal has effectively been removed; assuming the\nLords don\u2019t block the Bill we\u2019ve just passed. Indeed the Bill passed tonight\neffectively gives the EU the say on the length of any extension. It\u2019s no\nexaggeration to say it\u2019s a bill of surrender. It means a Brussels that can\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s luck will be heaving a sigh of relief. It\u2019s most unlikely now to\nbudge on terms for a withdrawal agreement. If it doesn\u2019t we\u2019re stuck.\nEventually a means to have a general election will, I suspect, be found.\nSadly, right now I cannot see any other way of resolving this. Bring it on.\n\n\n**3 September 2019**\nI\u2019ve just got back from a week in the Gulf region talking to my ministerial\noppos and others, mainly about the crisis in Yemen. Meanwhile back home rather\na lot has been going in British politics.\nThe current session of parliament is one of the longest on record. Arguably\nprorogation and a refreshed government plan articulated in the normal way in a\nQueen\u2019s Speech is way overdue. That\u2019s particularly the case given the change\nof government.\nNothing that has been done is unconstitutional or contrary to normal\nparliamentary procedure. Those who are trying to frustrate Brexit are\npredictably claiming that it\u2019s a scandalous abuse, that it\u2019s antidemocratic, a\nruse to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 Oct despite their best efforts.\nThat\u2019s a bit rich given that by their own admission they\u2019ve been using every\ntrick in the book to reverse the decision made by the people in June 2016.\nThese folks are intent on continuing to act in this way and the Speaker has\nindicated that he will help, an odd take on impartiality you may think.\nSo we will now have the long delayed Queens Speech in which I look forward to\na slate of new policies on all the issues that affect my constituents\u2019 lives -\nhealth, education, law and order and so on. As far as I can see this will also\nleave plenty of time before 31 October to debate Brexit. Beyond all the huff\nand puff and theatrical outrage of those unreconciled to Brexit is the truth -\nby my calculation the prorogation announced this week shaves off just 6 days\nof debating opportunity.\nI sincerely hope the EU will now offer a deal that can get through the\nCommons. That\u2019s in all of our interests . However, it has to know that if it\nrefuses the UK will leave on WTO terms on 31 October.\nBoris has always had my support. He has it now.\n\n\n**19 August 2019**\nOn Friday I ran a bumper advice surgery. A wide range of problems and issues\nwere raised.\nI\u2019m also tackling a number of local infrastructure issues. High on the list is\nthe ongoing congestion through Westbury made worse just recently by road\nworks. I\u2019m not best pleased by news that the council is prioritising another\nA350 bypass for Melksham but not Westbury. I have lobbied for a Westbury\nwestern route bypass for a very long time, noting that the air quality is now\nso bad in the centre of town that it has been designated an Air Quality\nManagement Area. I\u2019ve written to the council to find out what\u2019s going on and\nam perfectly happy to take the matter up with transport ministers who will\nhave the final say.\nOn the proposed (and wholly unnecessary - see previous blogs) Westbury\nincinerator, the focus now shifts to the Environment Agency. I\u2019ve contacted it\nto insist on rigorous controls if the wretched thing goes ahead that will\nremove very small particulates under the precautionary principle.\nIncidentally, if the horrible monstrosity sees the light of day it will put\nfurther pressure on the A350 making a western bypass for Westbury even more\nnecessary, a point I\u2019ve made in my letter to the council.\nAh, now here\u2019s a thought - maybe, since Melksham is evidently being put up for\na bypass and Westbury is not, maybe Melksham might like the incinerator too?\nIt is, after all, much easier to get to from the motorway network that will be\ncarting in much of the waste. The point is that when I knock people\u2019s doors in\nWestbury I find the abiding sense that the town is forever being dumped on -\nunwanted incinerators, hospital closure, no bypass and so on. Delighted for\nMelksham, but its a stretch to imagine that its needs are greater than\nWestbury\u2019s.\nUncertainty remains over Special Educational Needs plans for Wiltshire, in\nparticular the future of Larkrise school Trowbridge. Readers may recall my\ndebate in the Commons on the issue in March and welcome signs that the council\nwas listening to the strongly held views on the matter locally. My own view\nremains that the council is right to be spending serious money in upgrading\nprovision but that children with special needs deserve, as an absolute\nminimum, primary school education as near as can be achieved to their homes\njust like everyone else - that means keeping Larkrise. Let\u2019s at least bank\nthat proposition and we can then have a discussion about where to place post\n11 and a new sixth form.\nOn Saturday I went to the Imber open day. I\u2019ve been involved with the deserted\nvillage on and off over the years and particularly when we were persuading the\nfantastic Churches Conservation Trust to take on the only remaining building\nin one piece which is St Giles.\n\n\n**16 August 2019**\nOne of the joys of the summer as a newly reappointed minister has been to\nattend those cabinet committees that have been tasked with making key\ndecisions around Brexit and they have been coming thick and fast.\nBefore entering the committee bear pit, you\u2019d better mug up on the piece of\nthe jigsaw in hand. The process is facilitated by voluminous briefing notes\nfrom the very clever civil servants who populate Whitehall.\nThe change of government has infused the corridors of power with energy and\nurgency on Brexit. The source is Boris himself, charging up government like a\npolitical Sizewell B. Nobody should doubt his resolve to deliver Brexit in\naccordance with the outcome of the referendum. I feel deeply privileged to be\nin the supporting cast.\nNo deal planning is paradoxically part of the planning for a deal since only\nif you\u2019re demonstrably intent on leaving with or without a deal by a\nparticular deadline will the other party seriously engage. Most people with\nany kind of negotiating experience will readily understand that.\nGiven the time elapsed since our original Article 50 departure date in March,\nwe are in much better shape to leave without a deal. It\u2019s important to\nunderstand that if we did so it wouldn\u2019t be long before we reached a deal with\nthe EU in any event. After all, why on earth would Brussels not want a deal\nwith such a major trading partner and one to which it sells much more than it\nbuys?\nAs the UK economy outpaces it\u2019s major EU competitors, it appears that business\nis taking a frosty view of the apocalyptical forecasts of those who want to\nignore the referendum and, using all sorts of cunning ruses and subterfuges,\nseek a path that they believe will lead to a reversal of Article 50 and the UK\nreturning like a lamb to the EU fold. But what if they get their way? What\nthen?\nWell, I doubt we would have widespread civil unrest or blood on the streets\nalthough there would be ugly scenes. However, we could expect further\ncoarsening and division in our politics with , I suspect, the rise of\nunpleasant populism, nativism and nationalism. All the toxic ingredients to\nbreak up the UK, an outcome that I think is much more likely if we don\u2019t\ndeliver Brexit than if we do.\nFar better to deliver Brexit and move on. The sky really won\u2019t fall in. That\njob done, we can then get cracking on our new, better relationship with EU\nmember states and with the rest of the world.\n\n\n**15 July 2019**\nThere isn\u2019t much to report on the Brexit front as we wait for a new PM. I hope\nthe new man will energize the process and persuade Brussels that it\u2019s possible\nto tweak the backstop (maybe even using my eponymous amendment on a time limit\nwhich the Speaker frustrated) in a way that\u2019ll enable the Withdrawal Agreement\nto pass through the Commons.\nThat\u2019s the best option since WTO or \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, the default position,\nwill usher in a \u2018Nike Tick\u2019 with an avoidable short term downturn. Any sane\nperson would want to avoid the Nike down tick bit.\nLooks like Mr Corbyn has been doing his electoral maths and decided that his\nparty\u2019s interests are now best served by backing a Remain position, sort of.\nMaybe he\u2019s right on his own short term interest but, in my view, it\u2019s the\nwrong decision in the national interest.\nIf we had another referendum and if the result was about the same we\u2019d be no\nfurther on. If it went the other way the issue is hardly likely to be resolved\nand this whole grisly saga would just go on and on and on.\nFor goodness sake let\u2019s end this, recognize there are risks and opportunities\nin anything we do and make the best of Brexit. For hard-over extremists in\nthis debate, Remainers or Leavers, I would say prepare to be disappointed. For\nthe rest of us, pragmatists who recognize the democratic outcome of the\nreferendum, let\u2019s hope for a Withdrawal Agreement that will, finally, get\nthrough the Commons and the ability then to get on with issues that improve\nlife in the UK.\n\n\n**24 June 2019**\n **Thursday's Vote**\nNobody should be surprised by the names on the shortlist of two for my party\u2019s\nballot of members that will result a month from now in a new leader and\ntherefore Prime Minister (since, given the numbers in the Commons, only the\nleader of my party can form a government). Boris and Jeremy Hunt are both\nexcellent people. Both have committed to Brexit. I\u2019m hoping we will have a\nmonth of serious discussion about policy that will enliven and invigorate the\ncurrent party of government.\nI\u2019m proud of what\u2019s been achieved since 2010. The various economic, wage and\nemployment stats I believe speak for themselves. However, it\u2019s difficult for\nthe incumbent to present itself as bright and fresh after nearly a decade at\nthe helm. Maybe this is the opportunity it needs to seize the torch as the\ndriver of change.\nI am a serial Boris supporter - supported him in his aborted campaign of 2016\nand voted for him in every ballot this year. Because he\u2019s the frontrunner, the\nleft-leaning press has tried to paint him as something he is not. They have,\nand will continue to, big up mistakes and indiscretions he has made in his\ncareer in order to discredit him and remove the candidate best equipped to win\nagainst its alternative, Mr Corbyn. That\u2019s politics - to be taken with a\nwheelbarrow of salt.\nThe thing about Boris is he reaches places other politicians just don\u2019t.\nYou\u2019re drawn to him like a moth to a lightbulb. He has that wonderful,\npriceless ability to connect with people. He does human.\nI feel sure Boris will use the next four weeks to burnish his credentials as a\nsocially liberal politician of the centre ground, which is where most people\nare. Widely acknowledged at home and abroad as the two term Mayor of London\nwho really got things done and raised our great capital city\u2019s standing on the\ninternational stage, his moment is now.\nI\u2019ll be cheering him on, all the way to Downing Street.\n\n\n**17 June 2019**\n **BREXIT AND WHY I\u2019M BACKING BORIS**\nSome people say that whoever is elected to replace Theresa May nothing will\nchange on the Brexit front because the numbers in the Commons will remain the\nsame. They have a point. But, much as I admire Theresa May, new leadership\nbrings fresh impetus and the chance to reboot a process that has run up\nagainst the buffers.\nI hope Brussels will quickly understand that we either leave without a deal on\nbarebones WTO terms - which is far from ideal on either side of the channel -\nor we depart with a version of the Withdrawal Agreement tweaked to deal with\nthe deeply problematic, potentially forever, so-called Northern Ireland\nbackstop.\nUp for a challenge, a veritable constellation of truly excellent candidates\nhave put themselves forward for the top job. It is worth pausing to compare\nand contrast with their equivalents on the Opposition front bench - a mixture\nof Maoists, Marxists, people who can\u2019t add up and breakers of bread with any\ncrackpot regime opposed to the western values and way of life we and our\nallies hold dear. People who are perfectly content to laud Venezuela, parlay\nwith the IRA, Hezbollah and Hamas and get togged up for a white tie dinner\nwith President Xi but choose to snub the President of the United States of\nAmerica.\nIn my view this country right now needs a \u2018big beast\u2019 in Downing Street, a\nplain-speaking big personality who does human and has a proven track record in\nrunning things, a capital city for example. I want someone who has appeal way\nbeyond my party\u2019s traditional demographic since I want to win the next\nelection, and win with a good working majority. I want a mainstream, One\nNation, social liberal who may not necessarily be a details person but is\nsavvy enough to assemble people around him who are. Above all, at this time,\nmy choice has to be someone committed to Brexit, someone who believes in it,\nsomeone who will not tolerate officials approaching it as an exercise in\ndamage limitation.\nLadies and Gentlemen that person is Boris Johnson.\n\n\n**24 May 2019**\nThe EU has sunk yet another Prime Minister. In my view Theresa May has done\nher level best to carry out the wishes expressed at the referendum. She has\nbeen let down by hard-over purists in her own party who have now potentially\nlost us Brexit altogether and those Remainers across the House who have\npiously been saying that they will honour the referendum whilst doing all they\ncan to subvert it.\nPeople are right to be angry. I am angry. When the EU proxy referendum results\ncome out on Sunday we can expect Mr Farage\u2019s protest party to do very well\nindeed.\nWe will not now see the EU Withdrawal Bill. That means we can\u2019t withdraw. We\nwon\u2019t leave without a deal as the Commons has ruled it out and the EU in\nOctober will be perfectly happy to extend once again since that\u2019s in their\nbest interest. Parliament on past form will ensure an extension.\nWhoever wins the contest to come will still have the same arithmetic to deal\nwith as Mrs May. It\u2019s a classic poisoned chalice.\nI will back the candidate who comes up with the most credible roadmap for\nhonouring the democratically expressed instruction of June 2016 and offers a\nprospectus that has a fighting chance of giving most people most of what they\nwant.\n\n\n**20 May 2019**\n **Bring on the WAB**\nWell, there\u2019s a surprise. The cross party Brexit talks have now broken down.\nRead Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Theresa May and his reasons and draw your own\nconclusions. In my view, Mr Corbyn never intended to come to an agreement. His\naim, in my view, has always been to maximise disruption because he\u2019s working\ntowards just one thing - a general election that he would hope to win. Classic\nopposition stuff, jockeying for partisan advantage, which should surprise\nnobody.\nWhere does that leave us? It seems that early next month the Withdrawal\nAgreement Bill (WAB) will be introduced in the Commons. This, if passed, would\nenable to UK to leave before the end of the extension period granted by the EU\nwhich expires at the end of October. We would then continue negotiating with\nthe EU on future arrangements in accordance with the Political Declaration in\ntime for the end of the Implementation Period at Christmas next year.\nIf the WAB isn\u2019t agreed we are in unknown territory although \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit\nin October seems highly unlikely as the Commons will block it. A vote against\nthe WAB is a vote to block Brexit and for sticking two fingers up at the\nchoice made democratically by the people in June 2016. This last should worry\nyou even if you want to remain in the EU.\nThe Commons has already voted against a second referendum, and for good\nreason. There are those who hope and believe a second-go referendum would be\nwon at the second time of asking by Remain. If so, it would be a Pyrrhic\nvictory as I think this week\u2019s EU elections will show. You see, people don\u2019t\nlike being taken for fools. They voted in June 2016 in good faith, expecting\nthat government would do what it was darned well told. It will not appreciate\nbeing asked to think again. And the anger of those who voted Leave will know\nno bounds. They will not meekly slips away. No, this whole business will go on\nand on and on.\nNobody should be slating the Withdrawal Agreement without having read it. Now,\nits 585 pages aren\u2019t exactly a gripping read but you get a sense of something\nthat will work and give most people most of what they want. It will get us\nformally out of the EU and into the next phase in which we determine our\nfuture relationship with, for now at least, our biggest collective trading\npartner. It would settle us down, draw the poison of this horrible, divisive\nBrexit process, kill off the uncertainty that has been bedevilling business\nand result in an immediate uptick in our already robust economic fortunes.\nSadly, Mr Corbyn (see his letter) has chosen to reduce Brexit to a debate\nabout chlorinated chicken, a proxy for a visceral loathing of the US. Good\ngrief. Surely it\u2019s time for grown ups on all wings of the Brexit debate and\nMPs of all parties who have the national interest at heart to stop playing up,\nsupport the WAB and get this done.\n\n\n**12 April 2019**\n **Last word for a bit?**\nThis week I was meant to be in North Africa drumming up trade for UK\nbusinesses in my role as one of the PM\u2019s trade envoys. Instead we were doing\nBrexit.\nWe now have an extension of Article 50 until 31 October-ish. In reality that\ncould be flexed even more with a de facto limit in March next year I suspect\nwhen the EU Multiannual Financial Framework from 2021 gets signed off. In\nBrussels, money talks.\nI have supported the Prime Minister in her Withdrawal Agreement because since\nthe government lost its majority in the disasterous general election of 2017\nI\u2019ve seen Brexit running away from us faster than Darius from Alexander.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve trooped through the lobbies to vote for extensions, the last\ntime in order to give the government space to talk with Labour. Now, I suspect\nthat\u2019s a forlorn quest but, especially at this time of the year, hope springs\neternal. Let\u2019s give it a chance.\nMr Corbyn believes he would persuade the EU to give him a Customs Union in\nwhich the UK is a co-equal decision maker. Good luck with that. All I\u2019d say is\nI gave up believing in fairies at the end of the garden when I was about 4.\nHowever, as I put to the PM during her statement on Thursday, since the\ngovernment, the Irish PM, Michel Barnier and Angela Merkel have all said there\nwill be no hard border in Ireland even in the event of no deal we can safely\ncan the Northern Ireland potentially forever backstop in the draft Withdrawal\nAgreement that\u2019s so upsetting the DUP and Brexiteers on my side, including me.\nIn return for the backstop we should work on mitigating an up-front customs\nunion since Mr Corbyn has made it plain that Labour\u2019s custom union (details to\nbe supplied) is the condition of his corporation. Without that I fear Brexit\nwill never happen thanks to twenty or so unreconcilable zealots on the Remain\nand Leave wings of my party. Personally I have no difficulty reaching out for\nsupport wherever it can be found to get a workable deal across the line.\nCrucially, any deal involving an explicit customs union has to have an exit\nmechanism. Two reasons for that. Firstly, economic conditions may change. On\ncurrent forecasts the value of our trade with the EU will decline over the\nnext few years as that with developing and middle income countries outside\nEurope increases. We need to be able to unshackle the world\u2019s fifth largest\neconomy from a declining Eurozone as and when its necessary or expedient to do\nso. Secondly, a customs union of the sort Turkey, for example, has with the EU\nmeans trade deals Brussels does with non EU countries give the EU, but not\nautomatically Turkey, access to their markets, whilst Turkey is obliged to\nopen its doors to goods from those countries. We would be exposed potentially\nto all sorts of hideous goods dumping and would be powerless other than by\nthreatening to pull out of the customs union we had signed up to. That ability\nto withdraw would keep the EU honest because, as they say in Brussels, if\nyou\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu.\n\n\n**10 April 2019**\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what the Prime Minister will secure in Brussels but I\u2019m\nguessing it will be a long extension with some sort of early termination\nclause. I\u2019ve done everything I can to be supportive of the government (or more\nprecisely Downing Street since some ministers haven\u2019t been loyal at all) up to\ntonight when I reached my limit, voting for an extension of Article 50 to 30\nJune on the offchance that the current talks with Jeremy Corbyn come to\nanything. Of course its likely he\u2019s just stringing the PM along. Should we be\nsurprised? No, of course not. After all, Oppositions oppose and Mr Corbyn is\non a mission.\nIf we go beyond 30 June we are basically kicking Brexit into the long grass as\nthere will be nothing more to be debated in Parliament and no realistic\nprospect of progress. So I will oppose any further extension, even if offered\nby the EU, beyond 30 June.\nThe bind we\u2019ve got ourselves into is that we can\u2019t leave without a deal, on\nWTO terms, as a Remain dominated Parliament and the Speaker will block it. So\nwe are left with revoking Brexit, something that I will rigorously oppose. It\nwill then be for Labour MPs in Leave voting constituencies to explain why they\nblocked Brexit. Good luck with that.\nI think the time has come to smoke out those who have been saying they want to\nhonour the referendum but in fact have been beavering away to frustrate it.\nI\u2019d have a vote using the single transferable system. The options before MPs\nwould be;\n1\\. The deal agreed with the EU with any customs union changes that can be\nagreed with Labour\n2\\. Revoke Article 50 - ie Remain, contrary to the referendum\n3\\. Leave with no deal\nI think the first option would win. We would then ratify the deal with the EU\nand formally leave. I would even be sympathetic to the pre-announcement of a\nconfirmatory referendum rather like the Common Market one in 1975 at which\npeople would be asked if they are happy with it or not. I could be persuaded\nto have a rejoin option on the ballot paper, confident that it wouldn\u2019t by\nthen attract much support.\nWould Mr Corbyn cooperate with my sensible proposal? Not likely. It may be in\nthe national interest but, as I say, he\u2019s on a mission to get into Downing\nStreet. So its academic.\nCan you see how hair-tearingly frustrating this is? ****\n\n\n**4 April 2019**\nNone of the options in the so-called indicative votes that were meant to plot\na way forward on Brexit managed to get a majority. I voted against taking\ndeparture on WTO terms off the negotiating table since in the negotiations\nI\u2019ve ever been part of you don\u2019t announce in advance that under no\ncircumstances would you ever walk away.\nYesterday a Bill was rammed through by the Commons in just a few hours and\npassed by a single vote the effect of which is likely to be to kick Brexit\ninto the long grass. I voted against it.\nMeanwhile the PM has invited Mr Corbyn in for talks. What will the outcome be?\nWell, if you take him at face value Mr Corbyn wants, beyond what is already in\nthe Withdrawal Agreement, a customs union with the EU. OK, let\u2019s swallow hard\n- since it would mean being a rule taker and heavy constraints on our\nindependent trade policy - and see what we can do around that if it\u2019s the only\nway of persuading the Opposition to support departure from the EU in\naccordance with the referendum. If we do end up caving in on a customs union,\nwe have to retain the ability to change or annul any such union at some future\ndate, according to the national interest.\nIt is far more likely in my view that Mr Corbyn\u2019s demands won\u2019t stop at a\ncustoms union. To be fair to him - and I like to be fair when I can - he has\nbeen extremely successful in formenting chaos and bringing us closer to his\nheart\u2019s desire - a general election. Other than concern for the national\ninterest, is it really likely he\u2019ll stop now?\nHowever, politics has a way of surprising you.\nI imagine a Bill will be introduced by the government on Monday (the first\nweek of the cancelled Easter recess) to implement the UK\u2019s departure. It is\nquite likely the Withdrawal Agreement that Mr Speaker is trying to thwart will\nbe contained within it. If Mr Corbyn gets his form of Brexit with its closer\nalignment to EU rules, thinking perhaps and with good cause that it may\nirreversibly split the Conservative party, maybe it will get through. The U.K.\nwould, at last, be able to leave, the stated wish of 57% of South West\nWiltshire voters and one that I have for months, I hope pragmatically and with\nsensitivity to the 43% too, been trying to advance.\nMaybe as we approach Holy Week we\u2019ll have some calm, common sense and good\nwill applied to this matter at last.\n\n\n**28 March 2019**\n **Update on Thursday\u2019s indicative votes.**\nWell, I told you so! Indicative votes aimed at parliament \u2018taking back\ncontrol\u2019 ended in farce. None of the options passed. No deal, various\npermutations on customs unions, single market adherence, annulling Brexit\ncompletely, second referendums - all were rejected. So, we\u2019re left with the\nWithdrawal Agreement negotiated by the UK and EU. As it happens, I voted for\nthe \u2018no deal\u2019 option and nothing else, and that only because I think\nvoluntarily surrendering it whilst we can still be said to be negotiating is\ncrazy. I also voted for the statutory instrument to extend Article 50 to 22\nMay which is the logical consequence of supporting the Withdrawal Agreement\nwhich, in turn, is the only workable way we have to remove the UK in an\norderly way within a reasonable timeframe iaw the referendum.\nTomorrow we have a sort of vote on the Withdrawal Agreement that does not\nratify the agreement but is good enough apparently for the EU to accept a\nshort extension to 22 May and to prevent both a longer delay to our departure\nand our need to go through European Parliament elections.\nMessy? You bet. But amongst all the rancour, bitterness and plain nastiness\nthere is a real interest in process, getting to grips with complex stuff and\npolitical engagement. That\u2019s a good thing.\nI\u2019ll keep you posted.\n\n\n**27 March 2019**\n **End of the beginning/beginning of the end?**\nWell, this is fun.\nToday we have so-called indicative votes. The idea is to determine what MPs\nthink we should be doing about Brexit. But if its not clear that there is no\nconsensus among MPs after months of debate, motions and amendments, its never\ngoing to be.\nPersonally, I will continue to vote in accordance with the manifesto on which\nI stood in 2017, the last General Election. That manifesto was entirely\ncommensurate with the outcome in my constituency of the 2016 referendum - that\nis to say 57% leave.\nIf there is any doubt about what leave means, I\u2019d refer people to the handy\nbooklet posted to every household by the government in advance of the\nreferendum. As it happens, I am ashamed to say, it was a piece of publically\nfunded propaganda advancing Remain. However, it has done Brexit supporters\nsome service as a reference document for what leave is and isn\u2019t and offers an\nantidote to those who say the public wasn\u2019t told what leaving actually meant.\nThere it is, in black and white.\nI will oppose a second referendum. I didn\u2019t much like the first one and the\nprospect of this ghastly business being dragged out for the thick end of\nanother year with all the attendant rancour, bitterness, sheer nastiness\n(meaning I\u2019ve stopped reading my Twitter notifications) and business\nuncertainty makes me feel physically sick. Those advocating what they call a\nPeople\u2019s Vote (as if the first wasn\u2019t) of course just want another pop at\ngetting what they want - to stay in the EU - but they must know that even in\nthe unlikely event of them winning the issue will hardly just evaporate.\nIt should be clear by now to all but the most hard-over unreconcilable\nRemainers that the UK never has been and never will be an easy fit in the EU\nproject. Surely its better to be a close, amicable, cooperative neighbour than\na scratchy, difficult partner.\nIt seems the Speaker doesnt agree. He\u2019s up to his old tricks. He\u2019s just popped\nup to try to use a procedural wheeze to stop the government putting a third\nmeaningful vote (MV3) on the PM\u2019s withdrawal agreement to the House. What\u2019s he\nscared of? Ah, that\u2019ll be the momentum building up in favour of Mrs May\u2019s deal\nwhich, for those that have bothered to read its 585 pages and accompanying\nPolitical Declaration, actually gives most people most of what they want.\nThat, I\u2019m afraid, is about as good as it gets and, in that spirit of\ncompromise, is why I\u2019m supporting it.\n\n\n**15 March 2019**\n **Brexit - the tipping point?**\nAfter a week of Brexit votes where are we?\nWell, the second vote on the government\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement was lost but\nnot by as much as before. We then had a series of votes that concluded that\nthere should be no departure without a deal - i.e. no so-called hard Brexit. I\nopposed taking no deal off the table as it seemed to me that only the most\ncredulous negotiator would voluntarily rule out the option of walking away.\nOn Thursday we voted on having a second, so-called people\u2019s, vote, a second-go\nreferendum which is supported by those who actually want to reverse the\noutcome of the first. It was convincingly rejected. Then we had a free vote on\ndelaying Brexit to give the government more time. I would have been happy with\na few weeks but the motion potentially delays our departure for a year or more\nand then we might not have Brexit at all. That would be a betrayal of the\nreferendum. I voted against but the motion was passed.\nThe government will now ask the EU for a delay. I suspect it will grant one if\nit sees the likelihood of progress towards a deal.\nThe mood in the House is that we\u2019re approaching endgame and that next week\u2019s\nthird, so-called meaningful, vote (MV3) might just make it over the line. The\nreason is that MPs are worried about either an abrupt no deal departure on 29\nMarch which remains the default position, or shortly thereafter depending on\nwhat the EU says, or a long extension which may well mean Brexit is kicked\ninto the long grass for good.\nThe Attorney General has clarified the legal position and I feel more\ncomfortable that the U.K. will not be held in the so-called backstop and the\ncustoms union therein against its will. I do, however, accept that there\nremains some political risk.\nDespite this, right now the Withdrawal Agreement looks to me like the best\noutcome realistically achievable. It would get us out of the EU more or less\non time and allow negotiations to start on the future trading relationship\nwithout making assumptions about including a customs union in whatever\neventually transpires. It genuinely gives most people most of what they want.\nConsequently, I will be supporting it next week.\n\n\n**28 February 2019**\nOpposition parties and unreconciled Remainers on my side have been gradually\nchipping away at the negotiating hand available to the PM in her talks with\nthe EU. Hugely frustrating - some of them are my friends but you do wonder\nsome times whose side these folk are on.\nWe now have effectively taken no deal off the table. Now, very few of us\nreally want no deal but the threat of it has been the only thing concentrating\nthe minds of our EU interlocutors. As a result of this week\u2019s shenanigans I\u2019m\nless optimistic that our wonderfully Rumpolesque Attorney General will be able\nto loosen the legal handcuffs that is the Northern Ireland backstop. That\nmakes it is less likely the draft Withdrawal Agreement will get through the\nCommons. If it does by a whisker it means potentially the U.K. will remain in\nthe Customs Union forever given the legal risk the AG has identified.\nSome want us to remain in the Customs Union anyway, like the Labour Party. I\nput this to its spokesman Kier Starmer yesterday and asked, rhetorically, why\nhe wasn\u2019t then supporting the Agreement.\nIf the Agreement passes on 12 March we leave on 29th. If it doesn\u2019t, there\nwill be a vote next day on whether we want to leave with no deal. I suspect\nthe no deal option will be rejected by our predominantly Remain parliament.\nThere will then be a vote on extending Article 50 which will be amendable in\nterms of the length of the extension and of course it will depend on the EU\nagreeing. If agreed, legislation would be brought forward to revoke or amend\nthe Article 50 trigger that MPs on both sides overwhelmingly backed 2 years\nago. In my view, this is the route being sought by those who are still saying\nthey want to honour the 2016 referendum but in fact are trying to reverse it,\nin other words to keep the U.K. in the EU.\nMeanwhile the Leader of the Oppositions - whose acronym \u2018LOTO\u2019 is deliciously\nappropriate right now - has decided on a second referendum which, again, is\ncode for reversing the outcome of the first. In my view that would mean most\nof this year taken up with ongoing bitterness and rancour and with an\nuncertain outcome. Business would be denied the clarity it seeks. It is the\nheartsink option.\nMy constituents are telling me to just get on with it. I\u2019m doing my best to\ncomply.\n\n\n**19 February 2019**\n **No frogs and locusts**\nWe knew this would happen \u2013 all sort of calamities being blamed on Brexit.\nForget the fact that the predicted plague of frogs and locusts never\nmaterialised, that the number of jobs in the economy has been going up, not\ndown, since June 2016 and that the UK is the biggest recipient of foreign\ndirect investment. No, whenever a firm relocates or folds its down to Brexit,\napparently.\nWell, I would gently observe that company executives of outfits whose failure\nis related to their stewardship of course would look for something else to\nblame. Brexit\u2019s very handy. I note that Honda made it clear that its highly\nregrettable departure from Swindon to Japan in 2021 isn\u2019t Brexit related. But\nthat has not stopped Remain insisting it is.\nI genuinely take no pleasure in Labour\u2019s rupture. It is a great political\ninstitution and its duty as official opposition is to be the alternative, the\ngovernment in waiting. As a democrat I am bound to wish it a speedy recovery.\nIndeed, at the moment a small number of my own party are ramping up the\nrhetoric, confecting a case no doubt for their own departure. I predict their\nnarrative will be that the Conservative party is being taken over by right\nwingers. I can\u2019t see it sticking and one has to ask why, if they are so\nunhappy, they were content to stand on the party\u2019s manifesto under the current\nLeader less than two years ago. The same goes for MPs who have quit Labour.\nEither way, my view is that those who have or may quit the parties whose\ntickets they were elected on are in recall and by-election territory. The best\ntest for their convictions is the white heat of the ballot box. Good luck with\nthat.\n\n\n**14 February 2019**\nToday I went to see the PM with a dozen colleagues to discuss Brexit. Later\nshe was on the phone to EU leaders on the same subject. Nobody can doubt her\ndetermination to deliver a Brexit deal that gives most people most of what\nthey want. She has my full support.\nAnother day, another Brexit debate in parliament. I have resisted contributing\nin the last couple for two reasons. First, its like Groundhog Day - going over\nand over the same ground. Second, Speaker Bercow and his practice of ignoring\nthose he has taken against. I do so hope his successor - may he or she come\nsoon - is more like the great Betty Boothroyd.\nI am utterly frustrated by the partisans who insist we should rule out a no\ndeal Brexit. To be clear - I want a deal because I\u2019m risk averse and\nappreciate the importance of the EU as our biggest trading partner. But only\nthe most inept negotiator would publically announce that they would never\nleave on barebones WTO terms. The Opposition today were moaning that there has\nbeen no movement on the Withdrawal Agreement in Brussels. Just how much\nmovement do they think there would be if the PM stood up and said that she was\nruling out no deal? Precisely zero.\nSomebody wrote to me expressing their dismay that a recent migrant from Poland\nwas distressed by Brexit and her future in Britain. I get really cross with\nunreconciled Remainers who are cynically putting it about that EU citizens\nwill no longer be welcome here. They really should not be setting hares\nrunning and upsetting people like that. This government was pressing the EU\nfor months for reciprocal citizens\u2019 rights whilst Brussels demurred. It was\nmore interested in squeezing more money out of the UK. Finally, in the\nWithdrawal Agreement we have safeguards that people need to be confident in\ntheir future here. The PM herself has used every opportunity to reassure EU\ncitizens living and working in the UK that we want them to stay. Absolutely.\nIn Trowbridge the Polish community long predates the UK\u2019s membership of the\nEU. It\u2019s an intrinsic part of what we are in our little corner of England. I\nwould also point out our valued Moroccan community. I pride myself in knowing\nit really quite well. Its established place among us owes nothing at all to\nBritain\u2019s membership or otherwise of the EU for the obvious reason that the\nKingdom of Morocco is neither in the EU or, last time I looked, in Europe.\nSo, that\u2019s it for another fortnight. The February recess next week is\ncancelled so we can get Brexit related statutory instruments through (boring\nbut necessary procedural stuff) and ministers will be hard at it with their EU\ninterlocutors. Then we\u2019ll have another outing like today but hopefully\nreflecting newly minted legally binding limitations to the Irish backstop\nwhich is now the only impediment to the Withdrawal Agreement, albeit an\nexistential one.\nEnjoy what looks like, from my vantage point overlooking the sunny River\nThames, the first stirrings of spring. Ever the optimist.\n\n\n**11 February 2019**\nTalks continue with European leaders about changes to the Irish backstop in\nthe Brexit deal. It now seems the backstop may, in any event, turn out to be\nillegal. It seems that, as currently written, it challenges the Good Friday\nAgreement. My view is that the backstop might be a temporary expedient if it\nhelps the EU to get the Withdrawal Agreement across the line but it has to be\ntime limited. That\u2019s because it\u2019s actually about holding the U.K. into the\ncustoms union, potentially forever.\nI do think people like Donald Tusk need to cool it. Inflammatory remarks are\nnot helpful at this juncture and just put people\u2019s backs up. In contrast, Mrs\nMay\u2019s patience and good manners are remarkable. Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar too is\ncoming under pressure from businesses in Ireland for his unneighbourly\napproach to the U.K. and apparent refusal to look at alternatives to the\nbackstop in avoiding a hard border. Since the U.K. is now and will continue to\nbe Ireland\u2019s biggest trading partner, I wonder if that\u2019s wise.\n\n\n**31 January 2019**\n **From the Eurostar in snowy France**\nOn the train to Brussels I\u2019ve got a few minutes to jot down what I think will\nnow happen. I\u2019m in a bad mood as my 0647 departure from St Pancras was\ncancelled ?cause. Not great.\nTwo weeks ago I put down an amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement that would\nhave time limit the so-called Irish backstop. This you\u2019ll remember was said to\nbe designed to avoid a \u2018hard\u2019 border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. In\nfact, as most now accept, the border on which as it happens I was standing on\nMonday between Strabane and Lifford, could be kept like it is today using up\nto date customs and technology.\nWhy then is the EU being so intransigent? Well, the so-called Irish backstop\nis actually a Trojan Horse that gives the EU the option to bind the UK into\nits customs union, potentially indefinitely. Apart from the obvious political\nleverage this gives Brussels, it means that it can say to third countries and\nblocs its trying to do trade deals with that, in addition to access to its own\n450 million consumers, any trade deal on tariffs and quotas means access to 65\nmillion U.K. consumers for free. A valuable and enticing bonus! Unfortunately\nIreland, or at least its PM Leo Varadkar and his party, has been suckered into\nthis ruse, I fear at enduring cost to U.K./IR relations.\nAs a minimum, the backstop with its customs union clauses established a\nbankable position on which EU negotiators will expect to build the future\nrelationship. It implies we will remain in the customs union. That\u2019s a bit\nripe since the EU has been insisting all along that it won\u2019t do trade talks\nuntil we\u2019ve ratified the Withdrawal Agreement.\nTo be fair to Jeremy Corbyn he has, belatedly, spotted this. Whilst his\namendment this week insisted on a \u2018permanent customs union\u2019, a perfectly\nrespectable position if not one I\u2019d recommend, its clear from what he\u2019s said\nsubsequently that he sees this as one that the U.K. can withdraw from on\nserving notice, just like any other trade treaty commitment.\nWhich brings me back to my amendment which I suspect will return, at least in\nspirit, in the days ahead. What I expect to happen after the current Euro\nwindiness has passed over is for a closer description of what is envisaged for\nthe Irish border to be devised and for this to be inserted into the legally\nnon-binding, if serious and weighty, political declaration.\nBut the central, and easiest, device to make progress that will get the\nsupport of Parliament as indicated this week is for there to be a time limit,\nor sunset, on the backstop after which the U.K. or the EU can withdraw on\ngiving notice. In the meantime we will certainly have put in place customs\narrangements relating to the border that will ensure it looks and feels as it\ndoes today.\nIf the EU says no to this we must draw our own conclusions about its\nwillingness to act in good faith.\n\n\n**30 January 2019**\n **Tuesday\u2019s complex series of votes**\nAfter the comprehensive thumbs down given to the EU Withdrawal Agreement a\nfortnight ago, the government won by a decent margin on Tuesday. What this\nmeans is that Mrs May must now go back to the EU and say that the WA, if\namended with limits on the backstop, is likely to pass and ultimately be\nratified \u2013 before our departure date on 29 March. There won\u2019t be dancing in\nthe streets but the outcome should give most people most of what they want. It\nwould also allow us to move on, reunify a society that has been badly bruised\nand start talking about important public policy things again.\nThe ball is now in the EU\u2019s court. But it should be in no doubt that what\u2019s\nneeded at this stage is something judiciable, not a flimsy exchange of waffle\nin the form of letters or windy political declarations.\nThe votes yesterday rejected dragging the process out. More delay would just\nbring more rancour and uncertainty. Precisely what business says it doesn\u2019t\nwant. It rejected a string of indicative votes (haven\u2019t we had enough debate -\nhours and hours of it?). It did support no \u2018no deal\u2019 but in a non-binding way.\nNote that even if you know you will never depart with no deal it would be\nplain stupid to take it off the negotiating table.\nIn two weeks the PM must come back to the House with an amended deal.\nNaturally I tried to speak in Tuesday\u2019s debate since I\u2019ve been heavily\ninvolved in trying to get a sensible way forward on Brexit but, again, the\nSpeaker did not call me. More on this in due course.\n\n\n**28 January 2019**\nThis Sunday and Monday I\u2019m in Londonderry and Strabane with my Select\nCommittee. Both of course are hard up against the land border that\u2019s front and\ncentre of the Brexit debate.\nOn Tuesday we will be voting again on the Withdrawal Agreement. I discern a\nsoftening of opinion on both sides of the debate which is good.\nMy amendments deal with the main impediment to getting the agreement over the\nline, if selected by the Speaker, if passed by the Commons and if the E.U.\nshows a bit of flexibility. Lots of \u2018ifs\u2019 but fingers crossed!\nWe need to ensure most people get most of what they want. An amended WA would\ndeliver that.\n\n\n**17 January 2019**\nNobody seriously anticipated the scale of the government\u2019s defeat on Tuesday.\nBut, as with everything in the Palace of Varieties, its important to dig\nbeneath the crude headline figures to work out what the actual sentiment is.\nI spent much of the weekend phoning round colleagues to get a sense of what\nMPs wanted. I have a particular interest as I chair the Northern Ireland\nAffairs Select Committee and the so-called Irish backstop seemed to me to be\nthe big sticking point. All the rest, including citizens rights, even the\nmoney appeared to be manageable, but not the backstop. So, on Monday I tabled\nan amendment that would have put a time limit on the backstop. Considerable\nmomentum was building up behind it. Then Mr Speaker Bercow decided not to call\nit.\nI then voted for a lesser amendment he did call that might have delivered some\nof the same effect but which stood little chance. I went on to support,\nwithout enthusiasm but neverthess, the unamended motion in the so-called\nmeaningful vote.\nClearly I was on the losing side - a moderate, pragmatic Leave MP in a\npredominantly Remain parliament with a significant number of Leave MPs who are\nstill convinced they can have the purist and most absolute of Brexits, even\nnow. I respectfully suggest they will leave this process with nothing unless\nthey change tack fast, things being what they are. I don\u2019t want to be\nassociated with anything that results in no Brexit at all.\nTo be clear, the whole thing is now on a knife-edge. A version of Mrs May\u2019s\ndeal may squeak through with a single digit majority (the vote of no\nconfidence yesterday was a triumph for her) but to do so she must deal with\nthe backstop along the lines of my amendment.\n\n\n**14 January 2019**\n **THE BIG VOTE**\nTuesday is crunch day. Finally, I will, without much enthusiasm but\nnevertheless, be voting for the Withdrawal Agreement. A tough decision. I\nvoted to leave the EU but sincerely believe it\u2019s the right thing to do given\nthe circumstances that apply right now.\nHere\u2019s my big worry - after last week\u2019s shenanigans the Speaker, hard-over\nRemainers and an Opposition sniffing political opportunity will succeed in\nreversing Brexit or achieve an outcome that would have the same effect. That\nwould be an appalling indictment of the state of democracy in this country. I\nam clear that those forces would definitely make impossible departure on WTO\nterms. People who hanker after the creative destruction \u2018no deal\u2019 would bring\nneed to understand that.\nI will tonight be tabling an amendment to the motion on which we have our\nmeaningful vote that would sun-set the Irish backstop which, as drafted, could\nhold the U.K. in a relationship against its will indefinitely. That is the\nmain objection MPs have to the Agreement and my amendment will seek to deal\nwith it. The date on which the backstop expires is less important but our EU\ninterlocutors need to understand where the sticking point is for most MPs and\naccept the principle of the backstop falling away. Incidentally, the so-called\nbackstop is not needed to prevent a hard border as it\u2019s become increasingly\napparent that there are now or will be by the end of the Implementation Period\nin December 2020 technical and procedural mechanisms for allowing the NI\nborder to look and feel very much as it does today.\n\n\n**10 January 2019**\nThe Speaker\u2019s antics on Wednesday showed just what those of us who want to\nhonour the outcome of the referendum are up against. There are too many up\nhere who piously assert they\u2019re only wanting to carrry out the public\u2019s\ninstructions but without \u2018crashing out\u2019 as they put it. What they\u2019re actually\nup to is using every trick in the book to overturn the referendum and stay in\nthe EU.\nThat needs to be clearly understood.\nWhat also needs to be understood is that Brexit may, as I write, not happen at\nall since its purists are intent on making the excellent the enemy of the\ngood. We are in uncharted waters with a Speaker who has shown that he will be\nas helpful as he possibly can be in greasing the way for Remainers to achieve\ntheir outcome. If they succeed, goodness knows what will then happen. They\nneed to be careful what they wish for.\nI have added my name to the Swire amendment to the motion that will be voted\non next week that seeks to unite the sensibles on either side of this debate.\nThis basically would limit the Irish backstop. It isn\u2019t perfect but would take\nus further in ensuring we are not bound into an arrangement that is contrary\nto our interests and over which we have no control.\nMy big fear is that we will not leave the EU on 29 March through the various\nsubterfuges that are being deployed by the Remain side and will continue to be\nunearthed, apparently with the help of Mr Speaker. Delaying Article 50 would\nadd to the uncertainty businesses say they\u2019re suffering from and just kick the\ncan down the road. It is to be avoided.\nI suspect the government will lose the vote next week. I hope not by too much\nbecause the PM will then be able to go back to the European Commission for\ntheir best and final offer, which intel suggests they have prepared already.\nIn short, I believe we will have a deal by the end of March. If not, exit on\nWTO terms won\u2019t be great but it won\u2019t mean a plague of frogs and locusts\neither.\n\n\n**20 December 2018**\nI have never been so grateful to reach the end of term.\nThose who want a second referendum need to understand what that would mean. It\nwould mean the better part of 2019 locked in bitter, rancorous dispute before\na divisive further vote. That vote may give the second-goers what they want\nand overturn, just, the outcome of the 2016 ballot but equally it may not.\nLet\u2019s just get on with Brexit, with all its risks and opportunities, and make\nthe best of it. Who knows? Perhaps those now actively trying to overturn the\nreferendum may, with gritted teeth, come to appreciate the better, more\nprosperous, independent Britain the 57% of local voters had in mind when they\nvoted to leave in June 2016, a vision shared by the many who tell me they\nvoted to remain but would now vote to leave.\nI look forward to the Withdrawal Agreement, modified or caveated to make it\ncrystal clear the UK won\u2019t be tied into the backstop, being agreed and to the\nUK entering the transition phase in March. I also look forward to MPs being\nable then to refocus on all the normal things we focus on - healthcare,\nschools, infrastructure, defence and so on. That would be really good.\nIf I can end with a plea to nobody in particular. The \u2018stupid woman\u2019 debacle\nepitomises how nasty our political discourse has become. We can debate the\ncauses, but very few engaged in public life at any level are actually stupid,\nvenal or avaricious (there are exceptions to every rule). Perhaps those who\npurport to offer leadership in politics should cool it in 2019. Maybe then the\npublic who understandably take their cue on what\u2019s acceptable from rude,\nshouty, boorish political figures who cavort like pantomime dames through the\nmedia will too.\nHave a very happy Christmas and can I wish everyone, whether you\u2019re a leaver\nor remainer or somewhere inbetween, a peaceful and prosperous New Year.\n\n\n**18 December 2018**\n **Neverendum anyone?**\nOne referendum is bad enough, a second would be a calamity. I am strongly\nopposed to a second-go referendum. We had the people\u2019s vote on 23 June 2016\nand the government, facing down an Opposition scenting blood and its big\nchance and a minority of very shouty people at the extremes of Mrs May\u2019s own\nparty, is doing the best it can, the parliamentary arithmetic being what it\nis.\nSo what happens if those still not reconciled to having lost that vote get\ntheir way and we have another? What\u2019s certain is more months of increasing\nrancour and bitterness. Businesses will not achieve that \u2018certainty\u2019 they tell\nus they want for the best part of another year. And the result? Well,\nremainers need to be careful what they wish for. It seems to me, anecdotally,\nthat the leave vote is firming up. Nobody likes sour grapes. But, in the end,\nI suspect the result would be much the same as in 2016.\nWhat if it\u2019s narrowly the other way, that\u2019s to say 52/48 Remain/Leave? Some\nstarry eyed remainers no doubt think we\u2019ll just all kiss and make up and that\na benevolent EU will welcome us back like the Prodigal Son. I doubt it. The EU\nand our competitors in it will have us by the cojons. And they will, sooner of\nlater, extract their price from a diminished, recalcitrant neighbour. At home,\nLeave will cry foul and demand best of three - a neverendum would ensue. The\nmatter would never be settled.\nThose seeking a second referendum in order to have a pop at reversing the\nfirst need to put aside the condescending curled upper lip and put themselves\ninstead in the minds of those who wanted to leave. How would you feel? We have\nseen what happens when people believe they have been spurned, ignored and\nsidelined by elite metropolitan liberals in Paris recently. There has to be a\ncompact between the administration and the administered. That relies on trust\nand not being led up the garden path.\nThere are no honeyed words or clever phraseology that will be capable of\ndressing up a second-go referendum as anything other than the elite giving the\nplebs - poor unenlightened souls - a chance to reach the \u2018right\u2019 decision. It\nwould be a gross betrayal of a solemn undertaking in the biggest exercise in\ndirect democracy ever held in this country. For the first time it would make\nme ashamed to be in British politics.\n\n\n**13 December 2018**\nIn my view Mrs May\u2019s position has been strengthened by Wednesday\u2019s vote. Those\nMPs who \u2018put their letters in\u2019 prompting it were unwise and their timing was\nappalling. She won convincingly because the Withdrawal Agreement is getting\nclose to the best of the various outcomes - none of which will satisfy\neveryone - that are reasonably achievable.\nMrs May said before the vote that she was trying to get political and legal\nchanges that would satisfy those of us who remain concerned about what the\nIrish backstop could potentially do. The attitude of Dublin is crucial. Her\nfocus must now be on helping the Irish government deal with its own political\ndemons so that a time limit on this unnecessary backstop can be achieved and\nwe can move on. If she can, I think she will have cracked it.\n\n\n**11 December 2018**\nMrs May did the right thing in pulling Tuesday\u2019s \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the EU\nWithdrawal Agreement since she would clearly have lost it. As I write she\u2019s\ngone back to Brussels to seek a form of words that would clarify how the U.K.\ncan get out of the Irish backstop.\nI\u2019ll wait and see what she comes back with but essentially I\u2019ll support her\ndeal if there\u2019s a time limit to the backstop that the lawyers think will work.\nWithout it Britain is potentially over a barrel as the Attorney General\u2019s\nlawyerly opinion makes clear. The only way to get out of the backstop customs\nunion would then be to persuade the EU it isnt in its interests for us to stay\nor by offering key members concessions - such as access to fish, as the French\nPresident has already made clear.\nIf no progress on this is made, we will need to see Plan B which I very much\nhope doesn\u2019t involve delaying Brexit.\n\n\n**5 December 2018**\n **BREXIT - ARE WE NEARLY THERE YET?**\nI\u2019m grateful to people for writing to me about Brexit. Most messages have been\nfine but some haven\u2019t, which is sad. I think the rancour this process has\ncaused has taken many of us by surprise. I can\u2019t remember the public being so\nshouty since Mr Blair\u2019s activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, hugely divisive\nundertakings which continue to cast a long shadow. Mrs May is right to say\nthat whatever now happens we are going to have to heal the wounds.\nThe Attorney General\u2019s appearance in the Commons to explain the legal position\nof the proposed Withdrawal Agreement on Monday was well received. The bottom\nline is that under the agreement we will probably not be tied into the E.U.\ncustoms union long term but he can\u2019t rule it out. That\u2019s what lawyers do,\nadvise on the basis of risks of particular outcomes and it\u2019s then for the\nclient to make a decision. Here that means government and, ultimately,\nParliament. Anyway today the AG\u2019s full legal advice to government on the\nagreement must be published. I suspect like most smoking guns it will\ndisappoint those clamouring for it. But publication also means from now on\nlawyer-client confidentiality will not be guaranteed in respect of government.\nThat will have consequences as the now opposition may well discover to their\ncost in the fullness of time.\nYesterday Mrs May made a really good, highly thoughtful speech in which she\nasked MPs to back the deal. I have yet to decide finally on how to vote next\nTuesday and will be weighing up the risk of no Brexit and leaving on barebones\nWTO terms both of which are undesirable, in my view. My chief reservation at\nthis stage is the absence of a time limit on the so-called Irish backstop. The\nunfettered backstop will mean legal risk of being a rule taker for a very long\ntime, as the AG made clear. I\u2019d like to see a time limit, perhaps 5 years,\nafter which the backstop would fall away if it hasn\u2019t been made redundant by\nother means. If Mrs May\u2019s plan fails in the Commons on Tuesday, as seems\nlikely, I believe she will have to go back to the E.U. and say that the only\nway she can get the deal over the line is if they amend the agreement to\ninclude a backstop time limit. It will not have been lost on her that if there\nis no such time limit the Scottish Nationalist will demand a similar\narrangement for Scotland. Belgium and Spain with their own separatist problems\nmay like to give that some thought.\n\n\n**27 November 2018**\n **BREXIT DEAL UPDATE**\nYesterday the PM did another two and a half hours at the dispatch box fielding\nquick fire questions from MPs - the third time in ten days.\nThe Guardian has listed MPs according to how they might vote when the Commons\nhas its \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on 11 December. I\u2019m listed as \u2018unconfirmed\u2019 from\nwhich the Guardian has drawn the conclusion that I\u2019ll support the government.\nWell, my instinct is to be supportive knowing how hard the PM has worked\nagainst the intransigence of Brussels. However, I still have an issue with the\nso-called Irish backstop. It\u2019s actually not needed to avoid a hard land\nborder. However, a combination of Irish domestic politics running up to\nelection year and the desire, mainly by the French, to build in a lever in the\ndeal to extract further trade concessions from the U.K. in the future -\nMacron\u2019s jaw-dropping admission of this yesterday in connection to fisheries\nhelped to shed light - means that potentially this country could become a\nclient of the E.U., held into an adverse customs union against its will. I do\nt see how I could support that.\n **IF** an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement was inserted to remove the\nbackstop or even put a time limit on it, even a long one, the Guardian could\nlist me as likely to vote for the deal, without enthusiasm but nevertheless.\n\n\n**17 November 2018**\n **BREXIT (again)**\nI\u2019m ploughing my way through the 585 page draft E.U. withdrawal agreement and\nassociated papers. Its available online if you\u2019ve got a spare few hours, or\ndays.\nMost of it is OK-ish. Good, for example, on rights for UK and EU citizens\nafter Brexit. What I\u2019m worried about is the mechanism for leaving the so-\ncalled Irish backstop which is meant to ensure there is no so-called hard\nIrish land border. In reality, the EU is using this as a means of ensuring we\nstay in the customs union, without a voice, after December 2019 if we haven\u2019t\nnegotiated a better arrangement. Of course with the so-called backstop as\ndrafted in place the EU would have no incentive to agree a better (for us)\ndeal. So, backstop it would be pretty much permanently. Great as far as\nBrussels is concerned but it would be vassalage for the UK with the inability\nto engage autonomously with the rest of the world. Under those circumstances\nthe EU, that is to say a bloc of 27 competitor nations seeking all the time to\ntake business off the UK, would have us precisely where they want us,\neconomically and politically. It is bound to exploit its advantage.\nHowever, the agreement talks of an Indpendent Arbitration Panel that would\ndetermine when the backstop isn\u2019t needed anymore and whether the parties had\nbeen negotiating in good faith or not.\nIn my view, any independent arbitration process is bound to reflect the\nperfectly good customs procedures and technical arrangements that could be\nestablished to remove the need for a hard border. The Select Committee I chair\nhas been hearing from customs experts about this. Thus, if the EU refused to\nfree the UK from a demonstrably unnecessary backstop, let us say in two years,\nit would be deemed to be acting in bad faith. The mere existence of that\nthreat would encourage the EU to engage in the future trading arrangements it\nsays it wants.\nWhat I will be looking for in the days ahead is legal clarification that my\nunderstanding is correct and for firming up of the wording in the agreement to\nthat effect in the last stage of the negotiations.\nIf that is not possible, I maintain that we should pivot to so-called Norway\nFor Now (NFN) whilst we negotiate a Canada +++ style deal of the sort offered\nby President Donald Tusk (ie Norway Then Canada or NTC). I have written a\njoint letter with Frank Field MP about this in the Daily Telegraph recently.\nWhat then about Mrs May\u2019s leadership? Firstly, I salute her doggedness, sense\nof patriotic duty and sheer perseverance which is an example to us all.\nSecondly, I do not think its wise to change the ship\u2019s captain when you\u2019re in\nthe middle of a storm. I hope that under her leadership we will turn the draft\ninto something the majority of MPs will be able to support when it comes to\nthe meaningful vote next month. If not, I would want her to own the change to\nNFN/NTC. Either way, she has my support.\n\n\n**21 October 2018**\n **STILL BANGING ON ABOUT EUROPE!**\nI\u2019m flying to Belfast to chair an evidence session of my select committee in\nthe currently empty Stormont parliament building. So, a few minutes in flight\nsafe mode to tap out some thoughts on the unfolding drama that is Brexit.\nFirst off, can I express my despair at the MP \u2018colleague\u2019 who is attacking\nPrime Minister May in lurid terms, of course anonymously. Shameful,\ndisreputable, dishonourable. Whatever you think of Brexit, Mrs May is so\nclearly doing her best and deserves better than that.\nI do not think there is any appetite outside the M25 beltway for spinning out\nBrexit. Obviously the EU would like to because it would mean more money and\nthe possibility the U.K. may run out of puff and recant. Unlike the Prodigan\nSon though I doubt there would be any dispensations for the wounded penitent.\nMore like harsh terms, perhaps very harsh. Those wanting another referendum\nneed to temper their enthusiasm with that and the white fury of the majority\nwho believe the matter was settled in June 2016. If its U.K. influence they\u2019re\nworried about, they might consider whether a humbled, brought to heel U.K.\nwould be more effective than an assertive, independent partner that Brussels\nwould like to persuade to be alongside most of the time. I think I know the\nanswer.\nThe government is right to be preparing for departure on WTO terms. It also\nneeds to be explaining to the public what it would mean, which means\naddressing head on the wilder prognostications of the Remain rearguard. I want\nto see the Chancellor announce in the budget next week draft plans for turbo\ncharging the economy on the day we leave the EU in the event of so-called \u2018no\ndeal\u2019. This will mean for starters immediately suspending payments to the EU\nwhich, in the event of no deal, will have acted in bad faith and in an\nunneighbourly fashion contrary to Article 8 of the Lisbon Treaty. It will mean\ncutting VAT and corporation tax. The latter will act as a magnet to companies\nand announce that the U.K. is open for business. Import tariffs, except on\nfood we produce here, will be removed. He should take the opportunity to\naffirm that the Northern Ireland land border on the U.K. side will have no\nmore infrastructure on it than exists today and we will challenge the EU and\nIreland to behave similarly, managing the tariff consequences. If we are\ndriven to this by the obduracy of the EU and the passive-aggressive stance\nbeing taken by France in particular, 2019 will be tough but ultimately we will\nprevail.\nI do feel for the people of the Irish Republic and it\u2019s businesses who are, to\nbe honest, hardly being helped by the attitude to achieving a smooth and\namicable Brexit chosen by the current political leadership. Now Ireland didn\u2019t\nask for Brexit and, other than some potential benefit from a thriving\nneighbouring economy, will get all the downside with none of the uptick. It\u2019s\ntransformative low corporation taxes are likely to be canned by an EU lacking\nU.K. pro-business counsel (it\u2019s already planning this) but, even if they\u2019re\nnot, a no deal outcome is likely to see a freed up U.K. cut its own business\ntaxes in order to tempt companies from Ireland and the continent to offset the\neffects of Brussels\u2019 punishment beating.\nIt\u2019s a tough old world, I\u2019m afraid, and when the going gets tough you remember\nyour friends - and those who have not been as helpful as they could have been.\n\n\n**12 October 2018**\n **MORE EUROPE**\nOn Wednesday the PM kindly gave me a one to one meeting to discuss Brexit. It\nis good to know that she\u2019s willing to listen to an obscure backbencher with\nviews on the issue of the day that may not necessarily overlap completely with\nher own. I admire her strength and fortitude in trying to navigate a way\nthrough Brexit. She deserves huge credit and has my full support in delivering\nthe aims and aspirations laid out clearly in her well received Lancaster House\nspeech.\nMy chief worry at the moment from my vantage as Chair of the Northern Ireland\nAffairs Select Committee is that the land border in Ireland is being used,\nrather cynically, by the European Commission and it\u2019s unreconciled Remain\nfollowers here to subvert one of the most viable Brexit options. It\u2019s the one\nthat Donald Tusk, no less, has been pushing all along and it involves a deep\nand comprehensive free trade agreement, so-called Canada+++. The problem is\nTusk offered it for GB, not U.K., meaning NI would remain in the EU customs\nclosed shop, single market and European Court of Justice jurisdiction. It\nwould, in other words, be separated from its biggest market by far, GB, and\neffectively annexed to the EU.\nSurprise, surprise, up with that the DUP won\u2019t put, and neither will Mrs May.\nLike me a committed unionist, she will be mindful not only of the consequences\nfor NI\u2019s status within the U.K. but the boost any sort of new border down the\nmiddle of the Irish Sea would give the SNP in its crusade to build a frontier\nseparating Scotland from the rest of the country.\nBut it turns out the NI land border isn\u2019t quite the problem that many,\nincluding me as it happens, initially feared. Indeed, customs experts - that\nis to say people who really understand borders and live them as opposed to\npoliticians and hacks who pontificate about them - are increasingly calling\nout the Barnier orthodoxy around the creation of a hard border with attendant\napocalyptical security consequentials. They\u2019re doing us a great service a bit\nlike Hans Christian Anderson\u2019s character who pointed out the Emperor has no\nclothes. The supreme irony is that one of these experts was commissioned by\nthe European Parliament to opine on frictionless, near-invisible, high tech\nborders. How disobliging of him to deliver a report that makes it abundantly\nclear that the NI border could continue looking and feeling very much as it\ndoes today in the event of a Tusk style EU-UK free trade deal. No border\nguards, no flags, no watchtowers, no humourless officials stamping passports,\nno barriers or revenue men. Rather dull, in fact, just like now, exactly as we\nlike it.\nFor those looking for a relatively simple blueprint, can I recommend Lord\nDavid Owen\u2019s account published in his blog with which I largely agree. By the\nnext election I want to be able to look my voters in the eye and say that we\nhave done what we were told to do - decorously remove the U.K. (all of it)\nfrom the EU and its constituent parts - the customs union, single market and\nECJ. If we can\u2019t get a Tusk-style deep and comprehensive free trade deal by\nthen we would deserve to be kicked out.\n\n\n**17 September 2018**\n **TAKING A SPIN TO NUMBER TEN**\nI arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday with some broadly Eurosceptic MP\ncolleagues for a meeting over supper with Number Ten staffers. Outside the\npolice checks was a gauntlet of TV cameras wanting to capture this moment of\napparent crisis that they wanted to spin as evidence of a move against the PM.\nIf, like me, you\u2019re a Harry Potter fan you\u2019ll be familiar with the hack Rita\nSkeeter from the Daily Prophet. She spins faster than a whirling dervish.\nWestminster doesn\u2019t just look like Hogwarts, it often feels like it too. Too\nmany of those who record and interpret the utterances of politicians seem to\nbe using the appalling Rita as their role model. Anyway, we didn\u2019t discuss\ncoups or leadership bids for one reason - there aren\u2019t any. At the risk of\nbeing disappointingly dull, I reckon it would be a culpable act of collective\ninsanity to attempt to topple Theresa May at such a crucial time. She\u2019s got my\nfull support. Good luck Rita in spinning that.\nI take a long term view of our departure from the EU. If something very close\nto the Chequers plan gets us over the line and removes us from the political\nunion of the EU on 29 March in accordance with any reasonable interpretation\nof the referendum, unfettering the larger part of our economy, I\u2019ll be\ncontent. If we do depart on those terms, I want sufficient flex to be able to\nupdate the agreement in due course, mandated by commitments contained in\nfuture election manifestos.\nThe Kremlin continues to pump out child-like, ever changing, bare faced lies\nregarding its Novichok attack in Salisbury and Amesbury. That\u2019s it\u2019s stock in\ntrade. In fact it\u2019s quite effective as, however fanciful, it does spread seeds\nof doubt. Of course, there will always be the credulous, but Russian state\npropaganda like this more insidiously assists a spectrum of anarchists,\npersons who have made their life\u2019s work the pulling down of Britain and what\nthey imagine to be the \u2018establishment\u2019 and an overlapping assortment of\npolitical extremists, \u2018useful idiots\u2019 if you will.\nSo, this week the Kremlin asks us to believe that the two GRU hoods being\nfingered for murder and attempted murder in Wiltshire are just a couple of\nnice guys, tourists with a passion for ecclesiastical architecture. That\u2019s\ncleared that one up then.\nOil industry boss turned high priest Justin Welby has turned again, this time\nto politics. Not a good or sensible move, in my humble opinion.\nRecent exposure has me wondering what the CofE is these days or, to be\nbrutally honest, what it\u2019s for, but it is certainly no longer the Tory party\nat prayer, if it ever was. Actually, there\u2019s no way I would wish it to be, but\nif the Chief Exec of the established church together with those who owe him\ncanonical obedience continue to blather on about earthly matters in such a\nthoughtless way, their path to irrelevance will end up being even shorter than\nthis month\u2019s revelations about CofE adherence suggest.\nIt\u2019s true I\u2019m no bleeding heart liberal and I don\u2019t do virtue signalling but I\nhope I work as conscientiously to better the condition of those I was elected\nto serve as any in the House, regardless of party. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point\nof being in politics? Whilst the clergy must remind us all of our individual\nresponsibility to care for others, a duty that is by no means entirely\ndischarged by provisions we make collectively though the welfare state, I\nworry about the appropriateness of the Primate aligning himself with a\nparticular political tradition and by implication castigating from a\nmetaphorical pulpit those whose roadmap for remediating suffering differs from\nhis own.\nLittle wonder that so many, including those of us whose faith remains\nundiminished, no longer feel at home, or even particularly welcome, in the\nAnglican churches we grew up with. What a pity that for so many England\u2019s\nparish churches have become no more than charming venues for weddings and a\nconvenient place to solemnise our eventual departure to the gates of St Peter.\n\n\n**September 2018**\n **SUMMERTIME BLUES**\nNormally in August politicians and journalists pipe down. Not this year.\nRancour over Brexit and rows over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party have given\nthe gloriously sunny summer of 2018 an unfamiliar, harsh, unwelcome edge.\nDisappointingly, it is looking increasingly unlikely that Brussels is minded\nto accept the Chequers deal. I say disappointing because I thought, as it\nstood, it was a fair proposition - not my ideal, but pragmatic and potentially\nbeneficial to both sides. I wrote to the PM to assure her of my support.\nDespite some recent rhetorical softening, the European Commission is taking an\nabsolutist line on Chequers. It appears to be scared stiff that any\nflexibility will erode its constituent parts, advantage the U.K. and make\nother nation states more likely to demand \u2018me too.\u2019 That would, they fret,\nbring the whole grand project tumbling down. A project, let us remember, that\nhas yielded by far the greatest benefit to its biggest economy, Germany.\nNational leaders - with the exception of President Macron who seems to be\nploughing his own furrow - are taking a more nuanced view since their\nattachment to Brussels is less existential, less ideological. That\u2019s where\nhope of a sensible Brexit outcome lies. We know that Brussels is completely\nimpervious to public pressure. That\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s the problem.\nNational governments aren\u2019t. So as we close with 29 March 2019, the point of\ndeparture, businesses across Europe are going to be pointing out to their\nelected representatives the people consequences of no deal beyond WTO rules.\nThe government is right to say _publically_ that defence and security are\nsacrosanct. I hope a very different conversation is being had privately.\nEspecially since the EU is now claiming the U.K. can\u2019t be partners in the\nGalileo satellite project because we\u2019d some how become a security risk. Well,\nlaugh out loud at that! But if it is serious about the Brits being a security\nrisk, that would extend surely to the rest of our military, security and\nintelligence assets. The same ones that provide cover Europe enjoys but\nrefuses to pay for.\nHelp me out here Mr Barnier because I don\u2019t see a way of persuading my\nconstituents they should continue to prop up the security of EU states whilst\nBrussels is intent on being unhelpful on precisely the economic matters that\nmake such largesse possible. To say that defence, security and economic\nprosperity are somehow separable is obviously bonkers.\nLots of talk about a second referendum but it\u2019s just hot air. The fact is\nwe\u2019ve had our referendum and the disappointed can\u2019t have a second go. Article\n50\u2019s been triggered. We\u2019ve run out of time. Europe won\u2019t stop the clock and\neven if we recanted and asked to return to the fold it would be as penitents.\nThere would be no prodigal\u2019s welcome. Harsh terms could be expected.\nWhen Cortez landed on the beach in the New World the first thing he did was\nburn his boats to the waterline thus encouraging his men to look forward, not\nback. That\u2019s where we are right now with the EU, looking to maximise\nopportunities whilst mindful of the risks.\nAm I alone, by the way, in being mildly irritated by the term \u2018Peoples\nReferendum\u2019 to suggest a right-on, radical edge to the campaign for a re-run?\nThe \u2018people\u2019 in this case are not the poor, dispossessed and downtrodden\nconjured by the the term but, disproportionately, the liberal metropolitan\nelite and big business interests who are doing quite nicely from the way\nthings are.\nOn the other big political news story of the summer, anti Semitism in the\nLabour Party, I genuinely admit to being bewildered. The Labour MPs I know and\nrespect are so much bigger than this. I really hope the party of Opposition\nsorts this out, quickly, as it is the most appalling stain on politics\ngenerally.\n\n\n**August 2018**\n **BORIS AND THE BURKA**\nMessages continue to arrive from constituents about Boris, mostly supportive.\nI would say that nobody should be holding forth on this matter unless they\u2019ve\nactually read the article in full. It was, as I would expect from the liberal,\nmetropolitan Boris I know, arguing against banning the burka whilst saying, in\nterms that I would not have used, that he disliked it.\nNot just because of opinion in my very female household, I too find myself\ndisliking the idea that women in Britain today should feel obliged to cover\nthemselves up save for a narrow eye slit under a set of rules and norms\ndictated by men without even, it seems, any real theological underpinning. I\nvery much regret the wearers\u2019 consequent isolation from wider society. Indeed,\nany politician should be worried by it, and question it. However, unlike a\nstring of Western European governments, I would not ban the burka. That\u2019s\nbecause fear of trespassing on personal freedom outweighs, in this case and on\nbalance, concerns about subjugation of women and wider societal ills that may\nbe caused by the garment. So the burka stays.\nOf course, Theresa May\u2019s detractors have tried to turn this into a story about\na conspiracy to halt any leadership ambitions Boris might be harbouring. I\u2019d\nbe very surprised if any such witch hunt was underway. The truth is, as usual,\nlikely to be much more prosaic - the party\u2019s complaints procedure has be\ntriggered and the Party Chairman under the rules has to act.\nThat said, I and many of my colleague would react badly to anything in the\ntreatment metered out to Boris that looked disproportionate or heavy handed. I\nam confident that it will not be.\n"}]}, {"sentence": "Things could have been even better if the whole chip industry wasn't constrained by chip foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and United Microelectronics getting swamped under more orders than they can handle.", "truth_flag": "1", "texts": [{"source": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323312-tsmc-too-big-to-beat", "content": "\nTo ensure this doesn\u2019t happen in the future, please enable Javascript and\ncookies in your browser.  \nIs this happening to you frequently?

Mark Liu serves as Chairman and C. C.\nWei serves as CEO and Vice Chairman.[10]\nMost of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as Advanced Micro\nDevices (AMD), Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., Marvell, MediaTek, Nvidia, and\nQualcomm are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging companies such as\nAllwinner Technology, AppliedMicro, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and Spreadtrum.[11]\nLeading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also\nmake or made use of TSMC's foundry services.[12] Some integrated device\nmanufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities like Intel,\nSTMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments outsource some of their production to\nTSMC.[13][14] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers\nthrough its ASIC design services and design IP-portfolio.\nThe company has been increasing and upgrading its manufacturing capacity for\nmost of its existence, although influenced by the demand cycles of the\nsemiconductor industry. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and\ndevelopment expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion in an effort to fend\noff growing competition.[15] The company also planned to expand capacity by\n30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[16] In May 2014, TSMC's board of\ndirectors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to establish,\nconvert, and upgrade advanced technology capacity[17] after the company\nforecast higher than expected demand.[18] In August 2014, TSMC's board of\ndirectors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[19]\nIn 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC\nand A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[20][21] According to\nreports,[22] as of May 2014, Apple is sourcing its new A8 and A8X SoCs from\nTSMC[23][24] and later sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung (to\nincrease volume for iPhone 6s launch) with the A9X being exclusively made by\nTSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different\nmicroarchitecture sizes. Apple has become TSMC's most important\ncustomer.[24][25]\nTSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4\nbillion) in December 2010.[26] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013\nlist of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of\nUS$86.7 billion,[27] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[28] In March\n2017, TSMC's market capitalisation surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel\nfor the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's\nat US$165.7 billion.[29]\nOn August 26, 2019, GlobalFoundries filed patent infringement lawsuits against\nTSMC in the US and Germany. GlobalFoundries claim TSMC's 7 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm,\n16 nm, and 28 nm nodes have infringed on 16 of their patents. Lawsuits were\nfiled in the U.S. International Trade Commission, the U.S. Federal District\nCourts in the Districts of Delaware and the Western District of Texas, and the\nRegional Courts of D\u00fcsseldorf and Mannheim in Germany.[30] GlobalFoundries has\nnamed 20 defendants: Apple, Broadcom, MediaTek, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Xilinx,\nArista, ASUS, BLU, OnePlus, Avnet|Avnet/EBV, Digi-Key and Mouser.[31] On\nAugust 27, TSMC announced they are reviewing the complaints filed, but are\nconfident that the allegations are baseless and will vigorously defend their\nproprietary technology.[32]\nOn October 1, 2019, TSMC filed patent infringement lawsuits against\nGlobalFoundries in the US, Germany and Singapore. TSMC claim GlobalFoundries'\n12 nm, 14 nm, 22 nm, 28 nm and 40nm nodes have infringed on 25 of their\npatents.[33]\nOn October 29, 2019, TSMC and GlobalFoundries announced a resolution to the\ndispute. The companies agreed to a new life-of-patents cross-license for all\nof their existing semiconductor patents as well as new patents to be filed by\nthe companies in the next ten years.[34][35][36][37][38]\nOn 12-inch wafers TSMC has silicon lithography on node sizes:\nIt also offers \"design for manufacturing\" (DFM) customer services.[48]\nIn press publications, these processes will often be referenced, for example,\nfor the mobile variant, simply by 7 _nmFinFET_ or even more briefly by 7FF.\nTSMC is at the beginning of 2019 advertising N7+, N7, and N6 as its leading\nedge technologies.[47]\nApart from its main base of operations in Hsinchu in Northern Taiwan, where\nseveral of its fab facilities are located, it also has leading-edge fabs in\nSouthern Taiwan and Central Taiwan, with other fabs located at its\nsubsidiaries TSMC China in Shanghai, China, WaferTech in Washington State,\nUSA, and SSMC in Singapore,[49] and it has offices in China, Europe, India,\nJapan, North America, and South Korea.[50]\nThe following fabs are in operation as of 2018:[49]\nFab under construction as of 2018:\nTSMC has four Backend Fabs under operation: Fab 1 (Hsinchu), 2 (Tainan), 3\n(Taoyuan City), and 5 (Taichung)\nThe investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 12-inch (300 mm) wafer\nfabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally\nannounced in 2010.[51] The facility was expected to output over 100,000 wafers\na month and generate $5 billion per year of revenue.[52] TSMC has continued to\nexpand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[53]\nOn 12 January 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip\nSemiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300\nmm fabs to cope with increasing global demand,[54] which would result in Fab\n12B.\nWaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry located\nin Camas, Washington, USA. It is the second largest pure-play foundry in the\nUnited States. The facility employs 1100 workers.[ _citation needed_ ] The\nlargest is GlobalFoundries Fab 8 in Malta, NY, which employes over 3,000\nworkers with over 3 million sq. ft. under rooftop.\nWaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera,\nAnalog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies along with minor\nindividual investors invested US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at\nthe time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The\ncompany started production in July 1998 in its 200 mm (8 inch) semiconductor\nfabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[\n_citation needed_ ]\nTSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control,\nand currently operates it as a fully owned subsidiary.[55]\nWaferTech is based in Camas, 20 miles (30 km) outside of Portland, Oregon. The\nWaferTech campus contains a 1 million square foot (90,000 m\u00b2) complex housed\non 260 acres (1 km\u00b2). The main fabrication facility consists of a 130,000\nsquare feet (12,000 m\u00b2) 200 mm (8 inch) wafer fabrication plant.[ _citation\nneeded_ ]\nTSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical\nnature of the semiconductor industry. During upturns, TSMC must ensure that it\nhas enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand. However, during\ndownturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand, and\nthe high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[58] As a\nresult, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of\na few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the\ngeneral trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally\nalso been seasonal with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.\nIn 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-\nperformance, low-power applications,[59][60] leading major smartphone chip\ncompanies such as Qualcomm,[61][62] Mediatek[62][63] and Apple[23][25] to\nplace an increasing amount of orders.[59] While the competitors in the foundry\nindustry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation)\nhave encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[63] the\nleading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to\noffer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the\nrequirements for advanced mobile applications.[60]\nFor most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased\ndemand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its\nfinancial guidance in March 2014 and posted \u2018unseasonably strong\u2019 first-\nquarter results.[18][64] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with\n28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous\nquarter.[65] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight\ncapacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting\ntheir sales expectations or shipment schedules,[66] and in August 2014 it was\nreported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was\nalready almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years,\nwhich was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU\norders from Apple.[67]\nHowever, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in\nNovember due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its\ncustomers.[68] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous\nyear, while TSMC has forecast that revenue for 2015 will grow by 15 to 20\npercent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm\nFinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand\nfor less advanced chip fabrication in its 8-inch fabs.[68]\nIn October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the\ndevelopment of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[69]\n\n"}, {"source": "https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/the-geo-technological-triangle-between-the-us-china-and-taiwan/", "content": "Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific\nTaiwan is caught in the middle of a technological trade spat, one that might\nupend its all-important semiconductor industry.\nIn the 21st century, the battlefield between superpowers relies more on the\ntrade of bits, bytes, and computers than bombs, bullets, and coal.\nTechnological dominance is a key factor in power struggles, replacing \u201carms\nrace\u201d with \u201cAI race\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d with \u201csilicon.\u201d The software armory of\nsophisticated technology running on artificial intelligence is birthed from\nhardware chips no larger than a postage stamp. The entire digital ecosystem\nruns on silicon, made fragile by highly interconnected semiconductor supply\nlines.\nThe media view China-U.S. technology competition as a bitter rivalry. Apple\nand Huawei, two sparring tech companies, fight for ground, jostling for\nbetter, faster, and smarter phones, representing their nations in the\ntechnology battle. Despite seemingly stark differences, Apple and Huawei have\nended up with an identical problem: They rely on Taiwan for outsourced\nmanufacturing of all-important silicon components. With increasing trade\ntensions threatening to disrupt semiconductor supply chains and sanctions\ninhibiting the sharing of technology between the United States and mainland\nChina, Taiwan has been thrust into a difficult geopolitical (or more aptly,\ngeo-technological) situation. Were the technology economies of the world\u2019s two\nstrongest powers to fully decouple, Taiwan may ultimately have to choose which\nto trade with.\nDespite its small geographic size, Taiwan is a global giant in semiconductors.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSMC) supplies 48 percent of the\nglobal chip market. For many years, Taiwan has been the top player in silicon\nfoundries, entrenching its pivotal role in the semiconductor industry and its\nimportance to the value chain of firms globally. For years, TSMC has\nflourished through a studious neutrality, playing both markets by\nmanufacturing Chinese and American designed chips and subsequently supplying\nthem to competitors such as Apple and Huawei.\nIf supremacy in silicon chips wasn\u2019t enough to mark Taiwan as a country of\ncritical importance in U.S.-China competition, it is likely that the market\nwill become even more complex in coming years. As technologies become more\nspecialized, custom chips will be needed to meet the computationally intense\nneeds of machine learning. TSMC\u2019s ability to design and manufacture the most\nadvanced chips capable of hosting artificially intelligent applications puts\nit in a very strong position in a market that is estimated to reach $16\nbillion in the next three years.\nA second area of strategic importance is wireless communication technology. In\nSeptember 2020, Taiwan\u2019s economics minister, Shen Jong-Chin, unveiled plans to\nturn Taiwan into a key player in the supply chain for 5G technology with the\ndevelopment of smart semiconductors. In the past, the combustion engine,\nfuelled by coal and oil, was the cornerstone technology of the industrial\nrevolution. Today\u2019s information age and tomorrow\u2019s technological revolutions\nwill be fuelled by artificial intelligence and 5G.\n **Enjoying this article?** Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a\nmonth.\nAlthough the United States has its own domestic prowess in chip manufacturing,\nthe explosive growth in the U.S. personal computer industry was enabled by\nTaiwan from the outset. Much of the success enjoyed by companies such as\nNvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm came about as a result of Taiwanese silicon\nplants. The recent push from U.S. tech giants to secure R&D partnerships with\nTaiwanese companies is indicative of America\u2019s response to increasing tension\nwith the mainland. Companies like Google and Facebook, barred from entering\nthe Chinese market, are excluded from accessing over a billion potential\ncustomers. In response, Google has designated Taiwan as a gateway location to\nAsia\u2019s artificial intelligence market. American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)\nDirector Brent Christensen told attendees at the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship\nCongress in Taipei he had \u201cevery confidence that Taiwan can become to AI in\nAsia what Wall Street has become to finance in North America.\u201d Mirroring this\nconfidence, Google announced in early 2018 that Taiwan would be its biggest\nAsian R&D hub. To reach this goal, the American tech giant committed to hiring\n300 AI engineers and to training over 5,000 AI experts and 50,000 digital\nmarketing personnel. Google\u2019s investment in Taiwan may be the largest from any\ninternational company but it is not unique. Other leading American companies\nsuch as Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Uber, and Qualcomm have established AI R&D\ncenters in Taiwan, or have expressed future plans to expand there. Confidence\naside, America\u2019s choice of Taiwan as a strategic technological base close to\nthe mainland signifies the island\u2019s greater tactical importance in the broader\nU.S.-China competition.\nMainland China remains highly reliant on others for high-end chips, including\na strong dependence on Taiwanese imports. Efforts to develop domestic industry\nhave been slow; China notoriously spends more each year importing\nsemiconductors than oil. SMIC, the largest and most advanced chip foundry on\nthe mainland, has an annual revenue only one-tenth of TSMC\u2019s and is\napproximately five years behind in technology capability. The majority of\nconsumer technology products that bear a \u201cMade in China\u201d label depend on\nTaiwanese semiconductors, introducing the risk of rippling damage if supply\nchains are compromised.\nTaiwan is likewise dependent on demand from the mainland. In TSMC\u2019s most\nrecent annual report, exports to China accounted for 17 percent of revenue, a\nshare only set to grow in the coming years. After Apple, Huawei is their\nbiggest customer. Taiwanese supply lines may be tightly integrated with U.S.\nfirms, but parts of the Taiwan\u2019s chip industry actually operate within the\nborders of mainland China. In line with the trend of increasing globalization\nof the previous two decades, Taiwan\u2019s largest companies have been building\nfactories in the Yangtze and Pearl River deltas, integrating the semiconductor\nindustry more and more across the Taiwanese Strait.\nIn terms of human capital, the regions are codependent. A staggering one-tenth\nof Taiwan\u2019s labor force work in the mainland, and the mainland is intimately\ndependent on Taiwan\u2019s AI talent pool. China has been headhunting AI engineers\nfrom leading Taiwanese semiconductor firms, including the new CEO of SMIC. The\nmutual dependency between Taiwan and mainland China introduces complexities\ninto sustaining the working relationship. Amid burgeoning trade war tensions,\nHuawei\u2019s top executives made a trip to Taiwan to secure the supply lines of\nthe most advanced chips manufactured by TSMC.\nThe escalating trade war has seen Taiwan caught in the cross-fire both\ndirectly and indirectly. Taiwanese companies have been hit directly by U.S.\nsanctions. Washington\u2019s growing fear of Beijing-born technology has resulted\nin the United States using the stick, not the carrot. In July 2018, U.S.\nCongress passed a bipartisan bill known as the Microchips Act precisely to\ndefend against external threats to the semiconductor supply chain. Subsequent\nrounds of tariffs and sanctions have further pressured technology companies in\nboth countries, with Taiwan stuck in the middle.\nThis came to a head in May 2019 when U.S. President Donald Trump blacklisted\nHuawei and 70 other affiliated companies, acting under the belief that\ninterconnected supply lines posed serious threat to U.S. national security.\nAmerican firms like Intel and Qualcomm are forbidden to sell chips to any\nblacklisted companies. It was also rumored the United States reprimanded TSMC\nfor continuing to sell chips to Huawei. The U.S. considers Taiwan, the third\nplayer in the supply chain, as the weak link for Chinese interference in\ntechnology bound for America. TSMC denied the allegation, claiming their\ndecision to continue supplying to Huawei was supported by their supply-chain\nmanagement systems, which ensure that exports to Huawei do not contain enough\nAmerican intellectual property to fall under the ban. Despite this loophole,\nit is also likely that TSMC wants to maintain a strong relationship with\nHuawei given how much business their big neighbor brings.\nThrough loophole or loyalty, Taiwanese companies continue to operate in grey\nareas when it comes to sanctions. Quanta Computer, the world\u2019s largest\ncontract notebook computer and server builder, and Pegatron, a key iPhone\nassembler, both announced plans to move their company operations back across\nthe straits in order to avoid being hit by trade war tariffs.\nGet **first-read access** to major articles yet to be released, as well as\nlinks to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-\nPacific correspondents.\nWhether or not Taiwan finds ways to avoid the impact of direct sanctions,\nsevering shared manufacturing by blacklisting Chinese companies disrupts the\nsystem as a whole, creating long-lasting shock waves. The Trump administration\nnarrative is thus a dangerous one. Despite claims of protecting national\ninterests, antagonism may ultimately harm America, dragging Taiwan into the\nfray. Conversely, the disruptions may help China in the long term. Restricting\nChina\u2019s dependence on imported technology nurtures independence. As a case in\npoint, U.S. trade bans seeking to cripple ZTE Corp, a Chinese state-owned\ntelecommunication equipment company, only intensified the firm\u2019s pursuit of\nself-sufficiency as part of a nationwide response to eliminate risky\ndependencies. An address from President Xi Jingping professed self-reliance\nand yet more money was plowed into the National Technology Team. Pressure\nfalls on the shoulders of Alibaba, Baidu, and Huawei to bring their supply\nlines home.\nEven before U.S.-China relations began to worsen, China had begun a drive for\nself-sufficiency. \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d an ambitious set of technology\ndevelopment goals, exploded onto the world stage in 2015. As part of the plan,\nthe Chinese government seeks to grow its domestic semiconductor industry\noutput to $305 billion by 2030, absorbing 80 percent of domestic demand. To\nachieve these challenging goals, a $29 billion state-backed fund was created\nto finance the nascent semiconductor industry. Given how much China currently\nspends on imports, this is likely to be a profitable investment. Prior to the\n\u201cMade in China\u201d pronouncement, Chinese producers met 29 percent of domestic\ndemand. Now, they meet 49 percent.\nIt seems China\u2019s rejection of foreign dependence is already reaping gains. For\nexample, Alibaba and Huawei have both recently announced the launch of\nspecialized AI chips for cloud computing, machine learning, and autonomous\ndriving applications. Early efforts indicate that China is set to reach high-\nquantity and high-quality production. AI chips is the sector where China can\nmake the biggest advances over Taiwanese and American competitors. Moore\u2019s Law\nis a technological constraint on the pace of growth in computing power, and it\ncould also act as a limit to the pace of China\u2019s catch-up. In Moore\u2019s world,\nwhere computing power doubles every two years and cost halves, with a pre-\nexisting technology gap of between five and 10 years, China has already lost\nthe race.\n **Enjoying this article?** Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a\nmonth.\nHowever, Moore\u2019s Law has begun to slow down, which implies that giants like\nTSMC and Qualcomm won\u2019t be able to move forward so fast. In the words of\nJackson Hu, former chief executive of semiconductor foundry United\nMicroelectronics Corporation (UMC), \u201cIf China works hard enough, invests\nsignificantly enough, they can gradually move forward and [narrow the gap],\nwhile the industry might slow or hit a wall.\u201d\nIn addition, China\u2019s advances in the 21st century come from its large\npopulation and high penetration of technologies, which create a vast\ndatasphere. Data fuels AI and AI chips in turn fuel AI applications. Wang\nYuntao, deputy director at the China Academy of Information and Communication\nTechnology, identified AI chips as China\u2019s chance to \u201covertake the competition\non the bend.\u201d The dependence of AI on custom computer chips demonstrates that,\nin the future, strategic AI competition will be founded on cutting-edge\nmanufacture of semiconductors. In this future, China has the chance to become\na winner, despite its lag today.\nThe current trade war environment forces Taiwanese manufacturers into the\nmiddle of an intensifying U.S.-China battle. While a greater decoupling may\nforce Taiwan, alongside other East Asian regions, to choose sides, it also has\nthe potential to significantly damage this semiconductor giant. With China\u2019s\nself-sufficiency and America\u2019s suspicions of interference, neither country\nwill want Taiwanese chips. Currently Taiwan is caught in the middle of a\ntechnological trade spat, a small yet important third player. If the race\nbecomes two-player then this may result in a worse scenario, where Taiwanese\nsemiconductors become irrelevant.\nDirect hits may be overcome, sanctions avoided, and Taiwan\u2019s neutral trade\nposition may continue to please both parties. However, if U.S.-China trade\ncontinues to decouple, Taiwan\u2019s industry may be sunk as collateral damage to\nU.S.-China suspicions driving the domestication of technology. Regardless of\nwhat the future holds, the global interconnectedness of technological supply\nlines between China, the United States, and Taiwan decree geo-technological\nrelations as equally trilateral.\n _Hannah Kirk is a graduate student and Yenching Scholar at Peking University.\nShe graduated from Trinity College, University of Cambridge in 2018 with a\ndouble first in Economics (B.A)._\n\n"}, {"source": "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/", "content": "48.25 +0.43 (0.90%)  \nPre-Market: 6:22AM EDT\n(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is bracing for its most difficult year\non record in 2020, when tightening U.S. sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic\nthreaten to slam an already slowing business.Rotating Chairman Eric Xu said\nhe\u2019s aware of the potential for Washington to tighten restrictions on the\ncompany, including by stopping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from\nselling chips to Huawei. The Chinese government wouldn\u2019t tolerate such action\nand it would irrevocably damage the global supply chain, Xu said in some of\nHuawei\u2019s strongest comments against the Trump administration\u2019s measures so\nfar.\u201cIf the Pandora\u2019s box were to be opened, we\u2019ll probably see catastrophic\ndamage to the global supply chain -- and it won\u2019t just be one company, Huawei,\ndestroyed,\u201d Xu told reporters after unveiling 2019 earnings. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nthe Chinese government will just watch and let Huawei be slaughtered on a\nchopping board.

The White House is reportedly\nconsidering imposing restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to Huawei by\nglobal corporations such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co., a move that\nwould effectively deprive the Chinese giant of the most advanced chip\ntechnology. That would escalate already damaging restrictions on Huawei, which\non Tuesday reported net profit grew 5.6% -- the slowest pace of bottom line\ngrowth in three years.\u201cWhy can\u2019t China ban the use of American 5G chips, base\nstations, smartphones and other smart devices based on the same network\nsecurity reasons?\u201d Xu said, adding he couldn\u2019t confirm reports about curbs on\nTSMC.Huawei had previously reported sales growth of about 19%, to 859 billion\nyuan ($123 billion) in 2019, roughly the same as in the previous year. And the\nShenzhen-based company\u2019s profit improved to 62.7 billion yuan. But Xu said\n2019 was its most difficult year yet, when it was forced to transform its\nbusiness after expansive scrutiny and sanctions from the U.S. The effort to\ncontain Huawei -- and by extension, China -- forced the company to turn\ninward.The Trump administration\u2019s campaign to get allies such as Japan and\nAustralia to shut out Huawei gear and phones helped drive sales in the Asia-\nPacific down 13.9%, though that was more than offset by a surge at home in\nChina.In the fourth quarter alone, which was most impacted by the U.S.\nprohibition on Huawei selling Android phones with Google\u2019s mobile services,\nthe company shipped roughly 55 million devices, calculated from the difference\nbetween its September shipments update and the year\u2019s total. Of the 240\nmillion Huawei and Honor phones shipped, 6.9 million had fifth-generation\nwireless networking, an area where the company remains a tech leader.Pelosi\nJoins Trump in Warning Europe of Huawei\u2019s 5G ThreatContrary to warnings from\nAmerican lawmakers and diplomats, numerous European countries like the U.K.\nand Switzerland have opted to use Huawei\u2019s technology in building out their 5G\nnetworks. The U.K. and Germany have both echoed U.S. concerns about how far\nHuawei can be trusted with key infrastructure of the future, but those have\nnot extended to the severity of an outright ban.Huawei faces tremendous\npressure in overseas smartphone markets, where the U.S. ban on its use of\nGoogle Mobile Services severely undercuts the appeal of its devices. Without\nthe Google Play Store and third-party app ecosystem, Huawei phones simply\ncan\u2019t compete with similarly capable alternatives from the likes of Samsung\nElectronics Co. and OnePlus. The company reported flat revenue in Europe, the\nMiddle East and Africa alongside the drop in the Asia-Pacific. Those regions\nwere two of its major growth engines in 2018, whereas now 59% of its sales are\nat home in China.China\u2019s ambitious 5G network construction projects, which\nstarted in the second half of last year, also helped Huawei weather the\ninternational storm and sustain its core businesses.Huawei Makes End-Run\nAround U.S. Ban by Using Its Own ChipsFounder Ren Zhengfei initially estimated\nthat Huawei\u2019s May 2019 blacklisting by the U.S. could wipe $30 billion off\nannual revenues and threaten his company\u2019s very survival, though he has\ntempered that outlook more recently. Huawei mobilized a massive effort to\ndevelop in-house alternatives to American software and circuitry, while U.S.\nsuppliers like Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. found ways to continue\nsupplying Huawei vital components it needed to make its products. Huawei is\nalso selling base stations free of American technology in another effort to\nbypass the U.S. ban.With no relief from U.S. sanctions in sight and the\ncoronavirus pandemic stifling business across all industries, Huawei\nanticipates its most difficult year yet.

Each cost about 150 million euros ($160 million) apiece and\nship mainly to the U.S., Korea and Taiwan, where the likes of Intel Corp.,\nSamsung Electronics Co. or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as\nTSMC, rely on them to make faster, cheaper and more energy efficient\nsemiconductors.ASML manufacturing staff operate in an environment that is\nliterally shielded from the coronavirus pandemic that has forced millions of\nworkers around the world to isolate themselves from colleagues to slow the\nspread of the disease. As the rest of the Netherlands and much of the\ncontinent locks down, work in ASML\u2019s Veldhoven clean-rooms has continued\nlargely unhindered, potentially giving the company an edge for when corporate\nlife returns to normal.\u201cSo far we have been able to keep our production\ngoing,\u201d said Frits van Hout, ASML\u2019s chief strategy officer, ASML. \u201cThe\nsituation is of course dynamic. We encounter challenges as with every lockdown\nour suppliers will be affected, directly or indirectly.\u201dKeeping DistanceLike\nother companies, ASML has also implemented a raft of contingency measures\n\u2013from segmenting staff to drawing up plans if disaster strikes at a key\nsupplier -- so it can keep manufacturing equipment for chip-makers around the\nworld. Workers are split into two teams and are screened for virus symptoms\nvia infrared thermal cameras at the entrance of the clean room in\nVeldhoven.Social distancing protocols are in effect, and the company has\nspaced out the morning and night shift to ensure the groups don\u2019t meet, ASML\nsaid.Clean rooms are highly specialized infrastructure that\u2019s costly to set up\nand maintain, making that kind of environment difficult to replicate in other\nindustries. The biggest risk for the company lies not so much in its own\noperations seizing up but in a potential breakdown of its 5,000 suppliers, 790\nof which provide materials and equipment that are used directly to produce the\nASML systems.Besides its ultra-sanitized work environment, ASML has the\nbenefit of making machines that are considered almost recession-proof, given\nits commanding lead in an industry on the cusp of another technological leap:\nhigh-speed 5G networks.On Track\u201cMost customers want EUV and if ASML cannot\ndeliver due to such a factor, then they know they have to wait until the next\nquarter because you cannot get it anywhere else,\u201d said Marcel Achterberg,\nexecutive director of equity research at KBC Bank.The prized EUV machines are\nthe size of a bus. Customers can order older equipment, but EUV delivers\nbetter resolution, smaller components and improved performance in the chips it\nproduces.They\u2019re a crucial source of revenue for ASML\u2019s customers, too. By the\nend of next year, as much as half of TSMC\u2019s revenue will depend at least\npartly on some EUV processes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst\nMasahiro Wakasugi.Volume production of TSMC\u2019s most cutting-edge 5-nanometer\nchips, which use EUV, is still \u201con track\u201d for the first half of 2020 as\npreviously stated by management, TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao saidFor more\narticles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay\nahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.\nTSMC (TSM) closed the most recent trading day at $43.88, moving -1.1% from the\nprevious trading session.\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is going to make people a lot of money once the\nmarket stops falling.Source: canon_shooter / Shutterstock.com Since Feb. 19,\nshares have dropped from $67 to their March 12 price of below $50.

Made Some\nMistakesIntel remains a flawed company that didn't get the full benefit of the\ntech sector's run-up. Under CEO Robert Swan it is being run out of the finance\ndepartment. Its fabrication plants are now considered second-rate compared\nwith those of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Even management admits that its\n10 nanometer production will be less profitable than what it produced at 22\nnm, because of competition. Hedge funds were dumping it even before the virus\nhit. * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off Despite\nthis, Intel stock has gotten the full brunt of the downturn, with shares down\nby about one-quarter. The company known as \"Chipzilla,\" co-creator of the\nintegrated circuit with Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), is no longer considered\nbest of breed.Intel's old chips are highly insecure. The latest bug, called\nLVI, was found by teams of university researchers and will require a complete\nredesign to fix. It impacts five years of production.Intel is finding it hard\nto crack the memory market, after breaking with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)\na few years ago. Intel may have to work closely with Micron to meet its own\nneeds.After telling people to work from home and banning travel to China,\nIntel then found an employee tested positive for the coronavirus after\nvisiting its Arizona plant. Green ShootsWhy, then, am I telling you to fit\nthis dog into your portfolio?First, you don't need to have the best chips to\nsell into the cloud. You need the most chips, and the cheapest chips. Intel\nisn't going to lose its data center business.Second, Intel is about to take\nthis bargain approach into other niches. It has announced a full range of\nnetworking silicon for 5G mobile networks. It thinks it can grow that part of\nthe business from $5 billion per year to $25 billion in three years. Through\nBarefoot Networks, acquired for $7 billion last year, Intel is demonstrating\nswitches that run data at 12.8 Terabytes/second. This will expand its reach in\nthe data center market.Intel may be second-rate, but it does rate. It expects\nto have 7 nm chips in production next year, and still hopes to lead when the\nindustry gets to 5 nm a few years later. The Bottom Line on Intel StockIntel\ndoesn't have to be the innovation leader to make money in chips. In the cloud\nera it's how many competitive chips you make that determines how much money\nyou make.Intel is one of only four companies making microprocessors. The\nothers are Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), Taiwan Semiconductor and\nprivately held Global Foundries.

Now, investors are sitting on an 8.8% loss for 2020 after TSMC\nnotched its lowest close in four months Wednesday.As TSMC shares are Taiwan\u2019s\nbiggest beneficiary of international cash, they\u2019re also at the front of the\nline when foreigners pull back. As risk assets globally have slid to start\n2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak, foreigners have sold more than $8\nbillion of Taiwan stocks, second most in Asian markets, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.

In response,\nChina\u2019s largest technology company ramped up its own capabilities to\nmanufacture the gear, which is known as a base station.In a sign that the\nself-reliance is working, Huawei in the fourth quarter sold more than 50,000\nof these next-generation base stations that were free of U.S. technology,\naccording to Tim Danks, the U.S.-based Huawei executive responsible for\npartner relations. That\u2019s only about 8% of the total base stations that\nHuawei\u2019s sold as of February, but the company is quickly ramping up at its\nsecretive HiSilicon division to make more of these American component-free\ndevices, Danks said.\u201cIt\u2019s still our intention to return to using U.S.\ntechnology,\u201d he said. The longer Huawei goes without access to U.S. suppliers,\nthe more unlikely it is to be able to return to using them, Danks added.A base\nstation is a typically suitcase-sized piece of machinery that\u2019s used to help\nconnect wireless phones to fixed-line networks carrying internet traffic, and\nit\u2019s an essential ingredient in the next, or fifth, generation of mobile\nnetworks. Popular among telecommunications providers, Huawei\u2019s base stations\nare widely considered among the most reliable for the price.Read about how\nTrump\u2019s blacklisting of Huawei is failing to halt its growth.U.S. officials\naccuse Huawei of stealing valuable intellectual property and violating a trade\nembargo with Iran. The Trump administration blacklisted the company last year,\nsaying there\u2019s a risk Huawei could give Beijing access to sensitive data\ncoursing through telecommunications networks that employ its gear. Huawei has\ndenied the allegations. Critics also said the U.S. government imposed the\nsanctions to hobble China\u2019s leadership in key aspects of 5G technology.As of\nearly February, Huawei had shipped about 600,000 5G base stations to mobile\nphone companies racing to upgrade networks to the new standard, which is\ndesigned to deliver data at faster speeds to a broad range of wirelessly\nconnected devices -- not just mobile handsets. Most of these base stations\nwere made using stockpiled chips bought before the ban.While Huawei doesn\u2019t\ndisclose its suppliers, base stations typically rely on a kind of processor\ncalled a field programmable gate array that\u2019s made by Intel Corp., a\nchipmaking colossus based in Santa Clara, California, and Xilinx Inc., in\nneighboring San Jose. Those chips provide flexibility that makes it easier to\nupdate machines as new standards and features are added. Huawei\u2019s chips are\napplication-specific, meaning they\u2019re tailored to particular functions and it\ntakes more time and money to replace them. That\u2019s a disadvantage at a time\nwhen new technology, such as 5G, is in its infancy and still subject to big\nchanges.Read more: Huawei Engineers Go to 24-Hour Days to Beat Trump\nBlacklistThe U.S. initially clamped down on all shipments of U.S. supplies to\nHuawei, which had spent more than $10 billion a year on U.S. products, but\nlater began making some exceptions. Xilinx and fellow chipmakers Micron\nTechnology Inc. and Broadcom Inc. have all reported falling earnings on\nreduced or eliminated sales to Huawei.Attempts by the U.S. to persuade\nEuropean and other allied countries to ban Huawei equipment have fallen short,\nand chipmakers in Asia and Europe continue to supply it.For their part,\nAmerican chipmakers have argued that banning the supply of parts that Huawei\ncan get elsewhere is counterproductive, saying that the lost revenue crimps\nresearch and development budgets and the ability to produce the best chips in\nthe future.

Samsung will fabricate at least\nsome of Qualcomm's X60 modem chips, which will connect devices such as smart\nphones to 5G wireless data networks. The X60 will be made on Samsung's\n5-nanometer process, the sources said, which makes the chips smaller and more\npower-efficient than previous generations.\nQualcomm Inc on Tuesday introduced new chips designed to connect mobile phones\nto 5G networks that operate differently around the world. Qualcomm is the\nworld's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips. The San Diego, California-\nbased company said its new X60 modem chip, along with a new antenna chip, will\nbe the first to aggregate signals sent over the disparate frequencies used in\nthe two variants of 5G networks, a feature the company said will help boost\ndownload speeds.\n(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. announced its third new chip for 5G smartphones\nthat the company said will help cellular service providers and deliver another\nimprovement in mobile phone performance.The X60 is the chipmaker\u2019s latest\nmodem for the fifth-generation networks that debuted only last year and will\nbecome the mainstream service this year. The company said phones based on the\nnew chip will go on sale in 2021. A modem is a type of chip that turns radio\nsignals into voice and data.The part will allow a step forward in what\u2019s\ncalled carrier aggregation, according to San Diego-based Qualcomm. That means\nphones will use a combination of the new higher frequencies that make up 5G\nand the airwaves relied on by older networks. Data will be sent to and from\nphones much quicker than using one narrower piece of spectrum.Phone companies,\nwhich typically own the rights to use scattered batches of airwaves, will be\nable to get more efficiency out of their expensive assets. That should help\npersuade the carriers, who are key in the rollout of 5G, that it\u2019s in their\ninterests to speed up introduction of the new service, according to\nQualcomm.Qualcomm\u2019s chip revenue has reflected the surge and the maturing of\nthe smartphone industry. The company\u2019s semiconductor sales peaked in fiscal\nyear 2014 at more than $18.6 billion. In the last few years as consumers have\nheld onto their phones longer, revenue has declined to $14.6 billion.The chip\nwill also be the first to be made with 5-nanometer technology, the most\nadvanced production technique in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm\noutsources its manufacturing to companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co.Qualcomm was among the biggest\nbeneficiaries of the shifts to previous generations of mobile phone\ntechnology, when its chips became the market leader.

I'm talking about\nsemiconductors, of course, not Pringles or poker.\nWhile it's not unexpected that semiconductors have been hit recently, it is\nsurprising that chip stocks are only down as much as they are. Usually,\nsemiconductors are extremely cyclical, with soaring highs and crashing lows.\nYet semiconductor stocks have actually held up slightly better than the\noverall market for the past month, even amid the scary coronavirus sell-off.\n![SPY 1 Month Total Returns \\(Daily\\)\nChart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/0a474e40a53ae4b2daafc5c7ca2a483f.png)\nSPY 1 Month Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts\n\n\nWhy are semiconductors doing relatively OK in this crashing market? Well, chip\nstocks were actually already in a recession in early 2019, when the trade war\nand oversupply decimated demand. Semiconductors were actually primed for an\nupswing in 2020, just before coronavirus threw a wrench into the machine.\nWhen the coronavirus scare passes, the semiconductor sector could very well\nresume the strong upcycle it appeared to be having. While a deep recession\nwould cause chips to fall even more, a mere temporary delay in orders by a\nquarter or two wouldn't be so bad.\nIn that light, which of these two semiconductor stocks -- **Western Digital**\n(NASDAQ:WDC) or **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** (NYSE:TSM) \\-- makes\nfor the better buy at this opportunistic moment?\nWestern Digital and Taiwan Semiconductors are both semiconductor leaders.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nEach company makes two distinct types of chips. Western Digital is a producer\nof hard disk drives (HDDs) and NAND flash chips, which encompass basically all\nof the main storage technologies used today. The prices of storage components\ncan fluctuate wildly -- especially NAND flash -- leading to huge ups and downs\nin Western Digital's results. Still, the industry is fairly consolidated;\nWestern Digital is one of only three companies that make HDDs and one of only\nsix large companies that produce NAND flash.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is the largest and most advanced outsourced\nfoundry. It manufactures logic chips, encompassing both central and graphics\nprocessing units, for many of the top chip companies today. Importantly,\nTaiwan Semi doesn't produce its own chips. It's just a manufacturer for\nothers. Therefore, its results are tied to volumes of chips produced, leading\nto less exciting but steadier results than other chip companies. In addition,\nby producing a wide array of chips, Taiwan Semi has been able to turn that\nwide knowledge into a competitive advantage, becoming the manufacturing leader\nand passing **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC) in the race to produce a 7nm chip last\nyear.\nIn 2019, Western Digital had to deal with a crash in NAND flash prices. The\ncrash was caused by the trade war slowdown, as well as the industry's move\nfrom 2D to 3D NAND chips, in which flash companies began stacking storage\nmodules vertically for the first time. Though the process is difficult to\nexecute, going from a one-layer to two-layer NAND increases bits by 100%, so\nthere was a huge flood of supply in 2019 just as demand was softening.\nThat led to a huge loss for Western Digital last year, though some of that\nloss came from restructuring charges as it closed down an extra plant. Still,\nadjusted results yielded basically no profits last year.\n![WDC Revenue \\(TTM\\)\nChart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/242e693bd04cb2acb759c142e8878914.png)\nWDC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\n\nYet despite the chip slump, Taiwan Semi was not only able to weather the\nstorm, but actually grow revenue in 2019. That's because the build-out of 5G\nand demand for high-performance computing led to a surge in demand for\nadvanced logic chips in the second half of last year. Taiwan Semi doesn't\nproduce storage or memory chips, and the demand for leading-edge 7nm logic was\na boon to its results. The company even raised its dividend handsomely.\nTaiwan Semi has a set policy to pay out about 70% of its free cash flow out to\nshareholders as dividends. Confidently, the company just recently switched\nfrom a one-time annual dividend to a quarterly dividend, indicating\nmanagement's belief in steady, rising cash flows. The stock's dividend yield\nis currently about 3%.\nMeanwhile, Western Digital also pays out a dividend, though in light of the\nmemory and storage downturn, the company hasn't raised it for quite some time.\nCurrently, Western Digital's dividend yield is 3.4%, by virtue of its rapid\nrecent sell-off. So you'll be getting a slightly higher dividend with Western\nDigital, but you'll also be taking on more risk.\nWhile Western Digital's official GAAP (generally accepted accounting\nprinciples) earnings were negative last year, things are expected to bounce\nback in a big way in 2020, as demand returns and NAND flash producers pull\nback on production growth. Western Digital's forward P/E ratio, based on this\nyear's earnings estimates, is just 8.1. That compares with Taiwan Semi's\nforward P/E ratio of 19.7.\nSo, while there is more risk in Western Digital's stock, there's also much\nmore upside. In fact, Western Digital's stock still sits about 50% below its\nall-time high set all the way back in 2015. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semi is less\nthan 10% below its all-time high set just recently.\n![WDC\nChart](https://media.ycharts.com/charts/b7d5e97412312ab9e18cac72df15b1c7.png)\nWDC data by YCharts\n\n\nThe choice between Taiwan Semiconductor and Western Digital depends on if\nyou're looking for big upside with more risk, or relatively steady results.\nWestern Digital is also in the middle of a CEO transition, recently hiring ex-\n**Cisco** (NASDAQ:CSCO) executive David Goeckeleras to replace outgoing CEO\nSteve Milligan. That puts a bit more risk on the table as well.\nI still own Taiwan Semiconductor, but I sold off my Western Digital position\nfor now, as I've been seeking to limit risk in my portfolio (I still own\nplenty of semiconductor stocks). However, I'd also be looking to add Western\nDigital once again when the coronavirus panic passes. It's quite cheap, and\nthe long-term demand for memory and storage is still one of the more robust\ngrowth drivers in the technology industry.\nAggressive investors going bargain-hunting therefore may want to keep Western\nDigital on their radar for bigger upside once the current sell-off is\nexhausted. Memory markets can be volatile on the way down _and_ the way up.\nHowever, for those looking to limit risk and sleep better at night, and for\nwhom a steady and growing 3% dividend is just fine, Taiwan Semi is definitely\nthe safer pick.\n\n\nStock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Learn the factors that can influence the outcome of your labour\nor union negotiation.\nCollective bargaining negotiation between labor unions and corporate employers\nis a specialized area in the field of general negotiations. However, the\nunderlying legal and relationship aspects make these areas distinct. General\nbusiness negotiation and lawsuit negotiations are not regulated by statutory\nprovisions. In contrast, external laws mandate and govern a collective\nbargaining negotiation\nMany different statutes come into play during the negotiation process. Private\nsector bargaining encounters are regulated by the National Labour Relations\nAct (NLRA) for most workers. For railroad and airline personnel, the Railway\nLabour Act (RLA) regulates bargaining. Federal workers are covered by the\nCivil Service Reform Act. State and local government personnel are under state\npublic sector bargaining laws.\nUnder the applicable statutes, employees have the right to organize and to\nselect exclusive bargaining agents. These agents negotiate collective\nagreements defining their wages, hours, and working conditions. Agents may\nengage in concerted activity for mutual aid and protection.\nFor private-sector workers, this action allows them the protected right to\nstrike. Although federal workers and most state and local employees are\nprohibited from striking, several states do permit non-essential personnel to\nparticipate in work stoppages. Individuals who engage in a lawful economic\nstrike may not be dismissed or otherwise disciplined for such protected\nactivity. However, under the Mackay Radio decision of the Supreme Court, these\nindividuals may be permanently replaced. After replacement, the strikers\nmaintain preferential recall rights. This means employers must rehire the\nstrikers as positions become available before hiring outside persons.\nLabour unions are chosen by a majority of workers in an appropriate bargaining\nunit, which may consist of homogeneous skilled workers or heterogeneous\nindustrial workers. These workers become the bargaining agent for all of the\nindividuals within that unit. These agents have the right to demand to bargain\nover the wages, hours, and working conditions of the affected employees.\nOn the other hand, the NLRA specifically indicates that the duty to bargain\ndoes not require either side to agree to specific proposals or to make\nconcessions. The participants merely have to meet at regular times and to\ndiscuss the pertinent issues in good faith.\nOne aspect of labor-management negotiations that is distinct involves the\nongoing relationship between the sides. After completing collective\ndiscussions, the participants must continue to deal with each other. Union and\nmanagement negotiators must continue to meet to resolve disagreements that may\noccur with respect to the application of bargaining agreement provisions.\nEmployees and managers must work together to produce profitable goods or\nservices if the firm is to be successful.\nIf union negotiators drive a hard bargain that unduly inflates labor costs,\nworkers will be displaced by new technology. Workers may even have their jobs\ntransferred to lower-cost areas of the U.S. or to developing countries like\nMexico, China, or India. If the company treats its workers badly, morale will\nsuffer, and good workers may seek employment elsewhere. Employees may also be\nless committed to firm success, causing a decrease in productivity or a\nreduction in work quality.\nA factor which makes collective bargaining negotiations relatively unique from\nthe standard negotiation definition is that it entails many issues that have\nto be addressed. Many types of compensation have to be discussed, including:\nWhat hours will the employees have to work? When will breaks and meal periods\nbe? Almost any working condition of interest to employees might also be on the\ntable. The expansive number of issues requires drawn-out negotiations. These\ntalks may go on for weeks or months, as the sides try to resolve the different\ntopics.\nOn the other hand, many of the bargaining subjects allow the sides to trade\nissues in ways that allow expanding the overall pie and maximize the joint\nreturn involved. Corporations should concede issues union leaders value more\nfor topics management officials prefer. This permits the negotiating parties\nto seek win-win results that satisfy the underlying interests of both sides.\nThe multifactor aspects of collective bargaining interactions make the need\nfor thorough pre-negotiation preparation especially important. Both labor and\nmanagement negotiators should sit down with the people on their respective\nsides before meeting with the other side. This is a chance to decide which\nitems need to be addressed and to ascertain their priorities. Which terms are\nvital; which are important; and which are desirable?\nThe teams should decide which lower value issues they are prepared to trade\nfor preferred terms. Which topics should the team plan to raise first, and\nwhich later? Most negotiators favor starting interactions with less\nsignificant subjects. The hope is to reach tentative agreements on these\ntopics before moving on to more important issues. This allows the team to\nfocus initially on areas subject to joint gains while preparing to create a\npsychological commitment to final accords.\nAs the team approaches more controversial topics, those terms don\u2019t seem as\ndifficult as they would have had the teams begun talks with these subjects. In\naddition, neither side wants to see their prior tentative agreements disappear\nthrough a work stoppage. Therefore, both teams become more accommodating with\nrespect to the controversial terms.\nThere will always be distributive negotiating items that both sides value.\nThese issues generally entail monetary terms. However, even in this area,\nnegotiators may be able to expand the pie and simultaneously enhance their\nrespective positions. This can be achieved if negotiators are willing to think\noutside the box and seek innovative solutions. For example, if profits have\nbeen decreasing, a company may offer workers a bonus instead of a pay\nincrease. The employees get the benefit of the cash payments, but the base pay\nrates remain unchanged.\nCompanies dealing with increasing health costs could agree to larger\ndeductibles and co-payments instead of higher employee premiums. Employee\nhealth care premiums are a difficult subject for union officials, since all\nworkers see an immediate reduction in their take-home pay. On the other hand,\nincreased deductibles and co-payments are more palatable. This is because\nthese considerations only affect workers when they become ill. People are so\nrelieved to have health coverage that they have less difficulty accepting the\ngreater deductibles and co-payments.\nOne factor that makes collective bargaining encounters different relates to\nthe political nature of union officials. These officials are elected leaders\nwho generally hope for re-election. Management officials who have not taken a\nnegotiation skills course too often forget this critical factor. As a result,\nthese officials can embarrass their union equivalents in a public way.\nPolitical persons who are embarrassed before their constituents will often\nattempt to punish those who put them in this position. It is, therefore,\nimportant that management negotiators work to prevent such circumstances. If\nthey have bad news for labor representatives, they should share it with them\nprivately. They may take them outside the bargaining room or contact them on\nthe telephone.\nThe union leaders understand managerial constraints and appreciate being given\nthis information away from the eyes of unit members. Union leaders may then\nput on a show for their constituents at the bargaining table, but will\nultimately yield to firm demands they believe to be necessary. Corporate\nagents should allow these leaders to continue this role during the public\nsessions, recognizing that it will make it easier for them to give in later.\nAnother critical factor concerns the impact of negotiation anchoring. When one\nside begins with a generous initial offer, the other side is unlikely to\nappreciate this gift and reply in kind. Instead, one side begins to think it\nwill do better than expected. This side then begins with a less generous\nopening offer.\nWhen I was in graduate school studying collective bargaining, I asked a friend\nwho had been a local union president what would happen if company negotiators\nbegan with a beneficial first offer. He reacted with displeasure and suggested\nthat such behavior would probably cause a work stoppage. Once the rank-and-\nfile employees learned of the munificent management offer, they would raise\ntheir expectations and anticipate far better final terms.\nThis factor may have generated the cancellation of this year\u2019s National Hockey\nLeague season. The team owners were clearly concerned about rising labor\ncosts. The team owners demanded a specific division of revenues between the\nplayers and themselves. In so doing, the team owners apparently hoped to give\nthe players no more than 54% and retain 46% for themselves. Instead of\ninitially offering the players union 48 or 50% and allowing that side to talk\nthem up to 53 or 54%, the owners apparently began with an offer in the 53%\narea.\nThe players and their negotiators understandably thought they might be able to\nget something in the 58 to 60% range. The sides reached a stalemate that could\nnot be resolved before the entire season was lost. It is, therefore, crucial\nfor management negotiators to start with offers that are sufficiently reserved\nenough to leave the bargaining room once the serious talks begin. This allows\nthe political union negotiators to talk them up and take credit for the gains\nthey achieve.\nNegotiating sides occasionally encounter difficult topics that neither side\ncan surrender without a substantial loss of face. How can such issues be\nhandled without the need for a win-loss result? If the term is not essential,\nthe teams can resort to constructive ambiguity. This may include language\npertaining to this topic that actually says nothing intelligible. Both sides\nare then able to claim that they did not submit. If the issue subsequently\narises, the teams can try to resolve matters themselves under less difficult\ncircumstances.\nIf they are unable to obtain a mutually acceptable outcome, they can invoke\nthe contractual grievance-arbitration procedures and ask an outside neutral to\ndecide the matter. The losing party then has someone to blame \u2013 that pointed-\nheaded arbitrator. The labor and management representatives can then continue\nwith their relationship without unnecessary acrimony.\nOver the past 50 years, the decline of union membership has greatly influenced\nbargaining interactions. By the mid-1950s, 35 percent of private-sector\nworkers were union members who had their employment terms established through\ncollective bargaining. As the U.S. was transformed from a manufacturing to a\nservice and white-collar economy and while American firms were directly\nimpacted by global competition from emerging countries, the elevated labor\ncosts associated with unionized personnel became harmful to many corporations.\nNon-union companies hired law firms and labor consultants to keep their firms\nnon-union, and organized companies began to discover ways to get rid of their\nunions.\nAt the same time, the Labour Board and court decisions made it easier for\ncompanies to \u201cpredict\u201d job losses and other dire consequences associated with\nunionization. Unions sought to organize post-industrial entities like Wal-Mart\nand McDonald\u2019s, but they used blue-collar techniques to appeal to white-collar\nand service personnel who thought of union membership as \u201clower class.\u201d Union\nmembership steadily lessened, resulting in a union membership rate today below\n8 percent. If this trend continues and unions are unable to develop new\norganizing plans that appeal to post-industrial workers, they will become\nredundant outside such traditional industries as autos, steel, and electrical\nmanufacturing.\nIn their recent book, What Workers Want (1999), Professors Richard Freeman and\nJoel Rogers discovered that over 80 percent of employees would like some form\nof collective interaction with management, with almost half of these\nrespondents indicating an interest in traditional labor unions. On the other\nhand, most of the individuals indicating an interest in unionization suggested\na desire for less confrontational labor-management relationships.\nRepresentative unions can no longer sit down with employer agents and simply\nnegotiate the terms they would prefer to have. In our global economy, they\nmust understand the impact of their bargaining decisions on firm\ncompetitiveness. If they unduly increase labor costs or lower productivity,\ncorporate earnings will decline, and workers will be laid off. They have to\nwork together as partners to achieve results that reward employees for their\ncontributions to firm success while simultaneously recognizing the need to\nkeep companies competitive.\nA number of successful unionized firms have taken courses together on\ninterest-based bargaining. These courses are compiled to teach labor and\nmanagement representatives on how to look for ways to satisfy the underlying\nneeds of both sides simultaneously. Despite this recent approach, its\nunderpinnings were noted 40 years ago by Professors Richard Walton and Robert\nMcKersie in their classic book, _A Behavioural Theory of Labour Negotiations_\n(1965). The authors discussed the need for participants to prioritize their\nunderlying interests and seek ways to maximize the returns achieved by both\nsides.\nWhen complicated issues arise, teams may use separate committees to explore\ndifferent options they can use to handle these matters. These groups can meet\naway from public bargaining sessions. Groups can look for pioneering\nalternatives that might not have been used previously. Without the glower of\npublic scrutiny, they can explore options that might not be ultimately adopted\nwithout the fear of embarrassment.\nManagement officials often complain to Labour Law teachers about how difficult\nit is to determine whether particular topics are mandatory bargaining subjects\nthat must be discussed with union agents. Some subcontracting decisions that\nmerely involve the substitution of less expensive outside workers for present\nemployees must usually be bargained about. Other decisions involving partial\ndepartment closures or other fundamental changes in the business do not have\nto be discussed.\nThe Supreme Court endeavored to draw a clear-cut line between these areas in\nFirst National Maintenance Corp. v. NLRB, 452 U.S. 666 (1981). The court\nindicated that \u201cin view of an employer\u2019s need for unencumbered decision-\nmaking, bargaining over management decisions that have a substantial impact on\nthe continued availability of employment should be required only if the\nbenefit, for labor-management relations and the collective bargaining process,\noutweighs the burden placed on the conduct of the business.\u201d\nWhen basic firm decisions are based chiefly on labor cost considerations and\ndo not entail significant changes in company operations, bargaining will\ngenerally be required. On the other hand, when the decisions do not include\nconcern labor costs and do involve changes in basic operations, bargaining\nwill not be necessary. Where the line between required bargaining and non-\nmandatory bargaining is to be drawn is not clear. This fact should not,\nhowever, frighten management officials.\nAs noted earlier, the duty to bargain does not require that either side agrees\nto particular demands or the making of concessions. If company leaders are\nconsidering changes that might arguably be subject to mandatory bargaining,\nthey should resolve doubts in favor of collective negotiations.\nCompany leaders should advise union officials of their contemplated changes\nand offer to bargain. They should carefully explain the reasons for the\nproposed changes and ask for a union response. If the union is able to respond\nappropriately to their needs, company officials may decide to retain their\ncurrent workers and adopt the union proposal. If union negotiators do not work\nto satisfy firm concerns, the company negotiators need only bargain to a good-\nfaith impasse. At this point, they may legally effectuate their previous\nproposal despite union objection. They have to be sure to satisfy two crucial\nprerequisites to such unilateral changes. First, they must be sure they have\narrived at a good-faith impasse. This is when after thorough bargaining, the\nsides have reached presently irreconcilable positions.\nWhen in doubt, they should offer to have another bargaining session to be\ncertain they have reached this point. Second, the changes they unilaterally\nimplement cannot be more generous to the workers than those already offered by\ntheir side at the bargaining table.\nPeople who must partake in collective bargaining interactions should take a\ngood training course on negotiating if they can. It\u2019s also helpful to read\nplenty of books on the negotiation process. Collective bargainers should\nprepare for long, drawn-out talks which will take time to develop. This is\nboth because of the many issues to be addressed and the political nature of\nunion representatives.\nThese negotiators should also distinguish that most bargaining encounters will\nnot be settled until shortly before the existing contract is due to expire. If\nlabor leaders agree to terms too early, unit personnel may suspect they have\nbecome too comfortable with management and vote against contract ratification.\nIf, on the other hand, management negotiators allow the union agents to take\ncredit for the gains achieved through their last-minute efforts, the affected\nemployees are likely to be satisfied with the final results.\n _Charles B.

Its coverage, organization and impact have\nvaried over time and across countries. Inclusive bargaining, conducted by\nemployers\u2019 associations with a mandate to bargain, and supported by the state,\nreceived a strong impulse during the interwar Depression. In the Great\nRecession a more exclusive version based on enterprise bargaining appears to\nhave been favoured by governments and international agencies. How this relates\nto changes in bargaining coverage, multi-employer and multi-level bargaining,\nrules on extension and opening clauses is the subject of this paper, which\nsurveys developments in 38 OECD and EU countries. A distinction is made\nbetween long-term and crisis-related changes, and between regulatory and non-\nregulatory changes during the Great Recession.\n\u201cI regard the growth of wage bargaining as essential. I approve minimum wage\nand hours regulation.\u201d\n(John Maynard Keynes, 1-2-1938, letter on recovery policies from the Great\nDepression to President Roosevelt)\nCollective bargainingFootnote 1 involves a process of negotiation between\ntrade unions and employers or employers\u2019 organizations to determine terms and\nconditions of employment. Together with the right to organize, collective\nbargaining is a fundamental principle and right at work, recognized by the\ninternational community. The Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining\nConvention, 1949 (No. 98) is one of the eight fundamental Conventions of the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO). It guarantees collective bargaining\nas a voluntary process between independent and autonomous parties, and calls\non governments to take \u201cmeasures appropriate to national conditions [\u2026] to\nencourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for\nvoluntary negotiation between employers or employers\u2019 organisations and\nworkers\u2019 organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions\nof employment by means of collective agreements\u2019 (art 4).\nFor workers, collective bargaining has a _protective_ function - ensuring\nadequate pay, establishing limits on daily and weekly working time, and\nregulating other working conditions for those with weak individual negotiating\npower; a _voice_ or _participation_ function - the collective expression of\ngrievances and participation in the success of the enterprise; and a\n_distributive_ function - securing a fair share of the benefits of training,\ntechnology and productivity growth. For employers, collective bargaining has a\nkey _conflict management_ function - it provides a process for resolving\ndisputes of interest. Managerial control tends to be more acceptable and\neffective when legitimised through joint rules (Flanders 1968).\nCollective agreements and wage regulations like a mandatory minimum wage put a\nfloor in the labour market and thus limit cutthroat competition. This is the\naspect defended by Keynes in the quotation above. Stabilizing wages reduces\nuncertainty about future costs and prices and can thus contribute to raising\nbusiness and human capital investment decisions, which depend strongly on\nexpectations. Collective bargaining, when sufficiently inclusive and\ncoordinated, offers a mechanism for responsible wage setting, with outcomes\nthat are compatible with price stability and low unemployment (Aidt and\nTzannatos 2008; Flanagan 1999; OECD 2006; Traxler and Brandl 2012). Moreover,\ncollective bargaining relieves the state from the complex task of setting\nstandards and solving coordination problems in an area marred with conflicts\nand risks of non-compliance. It provides the possibility to tailor regulations\nto the circumstances in an enterprise or industry. In many countries and in EU\nlaw it is, moreover, possible to derogate by collective agreement from legal\nminimum standards on for instance working hours, employment contracting and\nemployee information and consultation in the enterprise.\nCompared to individual bargaining or unilateral pay determination, collective\nbargaining is associated with higher earnings, more security for employees and\nmore earnings equality. In the literature a gap between union and non-union\nwages, or more properly specified between workers covered and not covered by\ncollective agreements, of 4 (Norway) to 20 percent (Canada) has been reported\n(Hartog et al. 2002). A study based on ISSP survey data for 1995\u201399 covering\n17 countries found a union or collective bargaining \u2018mark up\u2019 varying from\nless than 1 percent, negative or insignificant in Sweden, Italy or the\nNetherlands, 4 percent in Germany, 7 percent in Norway and Spain, rising to\nmore than 20 percent in Japan (Blanchflower and Bryson 2003). A recent study\nof German wage data found that the gap between the average wages of covered\nand uncovered workers had risen from 8 to 19 percent between 1999 and 2010, or\nfrom 1 to 10 percent if controlled for firm size. The authors concluded that\nthe decline of collective bargaining in Germany in the past two decades - with\nthe coverage rate decreasing from over 80 to under 60 percent - has\ncontributed more to rising wage inequality than international trade\n(Felbermayr et al. 2014). Addison et al. (2014), using a different methodology\nand controlling for employee heterogeneity, report a smaller \u2018wage gap\u2019 in\nGermany of 3\u20134 percent during the first half of the 2000s. Their analysis\nshows that in a period of general standstill in wages, workers whose firms\nabandoned the sectoral agreement experienced a wage loss, albeit decreasing\nover time, whereas workers whose firms joined the sectoral agreement enjoyed a\nslightly increasing wage gain.\nAcross countries, there is a strong negative association between bargaining\ncoverage and wage inequality measured by the P1/P10 earnings ratio. Coverage\naccounts for 50 percent of the variance in wage inequality across the 32 OECD\nmember states (Visser et al. 2015). If rising inequality has a negative impact\non growth (IMF 2014; OECD 2014), then international and national policy makers\nshould think twice before weakening the institutions that underpin inclusive\nand coordinated collective bargaining. Of these institutions, multi-employer\nbargaining above the level of single firms is the most important. The level of\nbargaining accounts for 70 percent of the cross-national variance in\nbargaining coverage in a sample of 48 countries (Visser et al. 2015).\nIn this paper I examine what happened to collective bargaining during the\nGreat Recession, placing the development of the past six years in a longer\ntrend. I focus on developments in three interrelated dimensions that together\ndefine whether collective bargaining is inclusive and coordinated: (1) the\n_scope_ or _coverage_ of collective bargaining and extension of agreements to\nnon-organized firms and workers; (2) the _vertical structure_ or\n_organization_ of collective bargaining (multi- or single-employer bargaining;\nthe level(s) at which bargaining takes place; the relationship across levels;\nopening clauses and the involvement of non-union actors); and (3) the\n_horizontal coordination_ of bargaining behaviour and outcomes across\nbargaining units.\nI distinguish between _regulatory_ and _non-regulatory_ changes, acknowledging\nthat change can result from a modification of the rules or government policies\nunder which collective bargaining operates, or instead occur through\nbehavioural changes within unions, firms and employers\u2019 associations and\ninteractions between them. The data are from the Institutional Characteristics\nof Trade Unions, Wage Setting, State Intervention and Social Pacts (ICTWSS)\nDatabase, version 5.0, updated till 2013 or 2014,Footnote 2 and cover 38\ncountries (Visser 2015).Footnote 3\nThe Great Recession has not been kind to collective bargaining. Since 2008,\nwhereas summarized over 38 countries the number of employees in employment\nexpanded with 8 million, the number covered by a collective agreement\ndecreased with more than 13 million. The (non-weighted) _mean_ bargaining\ncoverage rate fell from 58 to 52 percent (Fig. 1, left panel).Footnote 4 In\nabsolute numbers this shrinkage is unprecedented since 1945, in relative terms\nit intensifies a development begun a decade earlier. In the non-European part\nof the OECD the average coverage rate now stands at just over 20 percent\ncompared to 50 percent in 1980. In CEE coverage has shrunk year after year\nsince free collective bargaining was restored after 1989 and during the\nRecession the mean dropped by 13 percentage points, from 42 to 29 percent. In\nWestern Europe the coverage rate, averaged over 18 countries, stayed close to\n80 percent until 1995 when it began to decline slowly until 72 percent today.\nMean trends in bargaining coverage and union density, 1960\u20132013\nThe right-hand panel of Fig. 1 visualises the mean rate of _unionization_.\nBasically the same trends emerge, be it that the decline of union density\nstarted a decade or more before the decline in bargaining coverage and the\nlevel of unionization is, on average, half the level of bargaining\ncoverage.Footnote 5 Union density decreased during the crisis in most\ncountries, prolonging a trend that began much earlier, but in most countries\nand unlike earlier recessions the fall in bargaining coverage was larger than\nthe decline in unionization. Unfortunately, the lack of annual data on the\nmembership of employers\u2019 associations does not allow us to analyse how much of\nthe contraction of bargaining coverage is due to withdrawal from employers\u2019\nassociations.\nWhat is decisive in these differences - across (groups of) countries - is the\nexistence or not of multi-employer bargaining. The level of bargaining\nexplains about three-quarters of the variation in bargaining coverage across\ncountries (Rsq = .77). All the countries in the upper half of Fig. 2 (left\npanel) are dominated by multi-employer bargaining. Leaving some difficult to\nclassify countries (Australia, Israel, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Luxembourg)\naside, all the countries in the lower half are dominated by enterprise\nbargaining. This association also holds over time. Wherever multi-employer\nbargaining breaks down and is replaced by single-employer bargaining, the\ncoverage rate decreases promptly and dramatically. Historical examples are the\nsharp decline in bargaining coverage after 1979 in Britain and after 1991 in\nNew Zealand. Current illustrations are the sharp contraction of bargaining\ncoverage in Romania and Greece following the termination of the national\nagreements in 2010 and the collapse of sectoral bargaining.\nLevels and changes in bargaining coverage, 2008\u20132013\nAs shown in Fig. 2, right panel, the heaviest losses in bargaining coverage\noccurred in a subset of ten countries: Romania, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia,\nHungary, Israel, Portugal, Bulgaria, Ireland and Latvia. In each of these\ncountries the decline in bargaining coverage was associated with, or caused\nby, regulatory change such as the discontinuation of national agreements and\nmulti-employer bargaining, changes in the rules or policies on extension of\nsector agreements to non-organized employers, and in the legal treatment of\nthe validity of multi-annual and expired agreements. In Israel this has been\npart of a longer process that began with the dismantling of Israel-style\ncorporatism far back in the 1970s and 1980s--moving the country\u2019s industrial\nrelations system closer to that of the USA than to Western Europe (Mundlak\n2007).\nIn Germany, the UK, the USA and Japan the erosion of bargaining coverage\nduring the Great Recession was the continuation of a process that had begun\nmuch earlier and was not related to regulatory changes during the crisis. Only\nin a few countries we see a counter trend; in Australia this may be due to\nregulatory change obliging employers to engage in bargaining under the Fair\nWork Act of 2010.\nThese cross-national differences in levels and changes illustrate that\nemployers face different choices under company and sectoral bargaining. Under\nconditions of single-employer bargaining employers may withhold or withdraw\nunion recognition as a credible threat in seeking a cheaper or less\nconstraining contract, or else relocate employment to a non-union environment.\nNewly established firms may refuse recognition to begin with and base the\nchoice of where to invest on how easy it is to avoid unions. Union contracts\ntend to become associated with older firms and investments, and coverage and\nunionization rates decrease together with declining employment in older firms\nand sectors. Legally mandated union recognition procedures, based on elections\nin which workers must choose between offers from the union and threats issued\nby the employer, as in the USA and since 2000 in the UK, have done nothing to\nstop the erosion in bargaining coverage and union representation that results\nfrom this logic (Moore et al. 2014).Footnote 6\nWhen collective agreements apply to whole branches of the economy, employers\nwho seek a change in the contract face different strategic options. They\ncannot easily escape collective arrangements by switching to a non-union\nenvironment, at least not when staying in the same sector and country. They\ncan outsource activities to firms located in branches with cheaper collective\nagreements; make greater use of \u2018flexible employment\u2019; discontinue membership\nin employers\u2019 associations; or work hard to obtain a change in the sector\nagreement, for instance transforming it into a framework for local\nnegotiations. All of these strategies have been used and are visible in the\ndata, but the overall impact on coverage rates is not a priori clear. For\ninstance, outsourcing to cheaper contracts, or greater use of flexible\nemployment, may be matched by an increase of collective bargaining activities\nand coverage of agreement in sectors such as cleaning, catering and security,\nand for agency work, part-time and fixed-duration employment, as has been the\ncase in the Netherlands (Visser 2013).\nExtension is an act of public policy based on explicit legislation mandating\nthe government, a public agency or, in some cases, the court to apply the\ncollective agreement beyond its signatories. Extension makes the normative\nprovisions of the agreement mandatory for non-organized employers. It serves\ndifferent purposes, such as the promotion of collective bargaining and self-\nregulation; the creation of common standards or funds for apprenticeships,\ntraining or pre-retirement; the enforcement of minimum wages and minimum terms\nof employment; and the binding of foreign service providers to domestic\nstandards. Extension has been used for more than a century and the legal\npossibility of extending collective agreements exists in 28 of the 38\ncountries in this survey. However, the way in which extension operates - when\nand how, under what conditions, and to whom it applies - varies a great deal\nfrom nearly automatic and applied to nearly all agreements in France, Belgium,\nSpain, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Greece (before 2010), Romania (before 2011)\nand Portugal (before 2011) to very selective, subject to representation\nthresholds and public policy tests like in Germany or Norway (see Table 1).\nThe use of extension orders has declined continuously since the 1970s in\nIsrael (Kristal and Cohen 2007), has been revived somewhat in Australia since\n2010, is legally possible but not used in Japan and Korea, plays an important\nbut declining role in supporting the few sectoral agreements that exist in\nCEE, and continues to play a large role in Western Europe, with the exception\nof Denmark and Sweden where no legal basis for mandatory extension exists.\nThere are no legal extension mechanisms available in Canada, Chile, Denmark,\nItaly, New Zealand, Mexico, Sweden, Turkey, and the UK. In Italy, however,\ncourts tend to honour minimum wage claims based on sectoral agreements for\nworkers performing similar work.\nExtension makes it less risky for employers to sign a sectoral collective\nagreement as it exposes them less to below-standard competition. For trade\nunions, extension cuts two ways (Flanagan et al. 1993:424): by eliminating the\ncompetition from low wage non-union firms or sectors, legal extension reduces\nthe incentives for employer resistance to unions. It also reduces the\nincentives for consumers to shift purchases to the non-union sector and\ntherefore increases union bargaining power. On the other hand, by providing\nfor free what unions charge for, legal extension encourages \u2018free riders\u2019\namong potential union members.\nSince the Great Recession extension procedures have been changed in Greece,\nIreland, Portugal, Romania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria,\nthe Netherlands and Germany. In Greece, the Budget Law of 2011 suspended\nextension for the duration of the financial assistance measures, until 2015 or\nlater. Unilateral recourse to arbitration, which usually helped trade unions\nto defend their case, was also struck from the law. Once non-member firms were\nno longer bound by the sector agreement, many took the opportunity to\nnegotiate company agreements with less favourable provisions. After the change\nin government in May 2011, the Portuguese administration stopped issuing\nextension orders. Pressure from the Troika led to the introduction of a\nquantitative threshold, similar to those in other countries; in order to\nqualify for extension the agreement must already cover half of the workers in\nthe branch, geographical area or professional category (Ramalho 2013). The\nPortuguese economy is dominated by very small firms and with a 38 percent\nemployment share of member firms in the private sector, employers\u2019\norganization is low by European standards (Naumann 2015). The result has been\na dramatic drop in both sectoral agreements and extension orders, from an\naverage of 113 per year between 2000 and 2010, or 61 percent of all sectoral\nagreements concluded during these years, to 17 in 2011, 12 in 2012, 9 in 2013\nand 13 in 2014.Footnote 7 The number of newly reached sectoral agreements had\nbeen declining since 2008 but dropped under 100 for the first time in 2011\nwith 36 new agreements in 2012 and just 27 in 2013. There was some recovery in\nsectoral bargaining in 2014 but the number of workers covered by newly\nconcluded sectoral agreements, 215 thousand, is only a fifth of the number\ncovered by newly reached agreements in 2010. Enterprise and \u2018group level\u2019\nagreements register a similar sharp decline in recent times and the total\ncoverage of new agreements has dropped to a mere 6.4 percent in 2013 from an\naverage of 44.2 percent between 2000 and 2010. It is only through the coverage\nof older, still valid agreements, of which half are more than eight years old,\nthat a coverage rate of about 70 percent is reached, but this begs the\nquestion as to how relevant these older agreements are in terms of (minimum)\nwage protection. The decline in bargaining activity at all levels suggests\nthat the change in extension policy is not the only or perhaps not even the\nmain cause, but that the dire economic conditions in many sectors and firms\nand uncertainty about government policies and regulatory changes may have\nprompted a standstill in bargaining (see for another interpretation Addison et\nal. 2015a). Whatever the role of extension, in 2014, after the rescue program\nfinished, the government eased the criteria for extension: employers\u2019\norganisations with 30 percent or more SMEs among their members can have their\nagreements extended even if they do not represent 50 percent of the sector\u2019s\nemployees.\nRomania\u2019s extension provisions were stopped by the 2011 Social Dialogue Act,\nwhich stipulates that sector agreements are applicable only to the members of\nthe employers\u2019 organization(s) concluding them. In Ireland, decisions by the\nHigh Court in 2011 and the Supreme Court in 2013 found that Employment\nRegulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), which give\nbinding effect to wage-setting mechanisms in some sectors, are\nunconstitutional (see also Regan 2013). The 1946 Industrial Relations Act was\namended in 2015 to re-allow extension. Estonia has moved away from automatic\nextension, although applying to very few agreements. The procedure for\ntriggering extension in Slovakia has been a source of controversy and was\nchanged each time after elections. A 2007 law had removed the requirement that\na non-organized firm affected by extension orders must give its consent. This\ndecision was reversed in 2010 and reinstated in 2014, after the change in\ngovernment. The result was that there were no extension orders between 2011\nand 2013. In the Czech Republic the law was amended in 2012 to provide for a\nprovision that allows for the exemption of SMEs or firms in financial\ndistress.\nGoing in the other direction, the Dutch government tightened in 2009 the rules\nunder which firms can get exemptions from extension decisions. In order to\nqualify, the firm must not only negotiate a valid enterprise agreement with a\nbona fide union, but also show \u2018compelling reasons\u2019 why it should need\nderogation from the sector standard. In the period 2009\u20132014 about half the\nexemption requests, most of which are related to the extended agreements for\nagency workers, have been rejected. In some industries, for instance\nconstruction, the social partners award exemptions. In 2014, following the\nchange in government, the German authorities took some measures, among which\nsetting a threshold lower than 50 percent, intended to facilitate the uptake\nof extension procedures. In Bulgaria the government revived the 2001 law and\nissued three extension orders in 2009 but it did not stop the decline in\nsectoral bargaining in manufacturing. It is unclear whether the lowering of\nthe representation threshold for trade unions in 2012 has had any effect.\nProcedures that influence the length of agreements and their validity beyond\nexpiry also influence bargaining coverage. Such procedures tend to protect\nworkers should employers refuse to negotiate and they strengthen the union\nnegotiating position in case employers want to lower standards. The purpose of\nreforms of recent years has been to move unions to concession bargaining in\ntimes of recession.\nIn Greece the reform of 2012 replaced the possibility of indefinite collective\nagreements by a minimum validity of one and a maximum of three years\n(Dedoussopoulos et al. 2013). The \u2018after-effect\u2019 of expired agreements has\nbeen reduced from six to three months. If no new agreement can be concluded\nduring this grace period, the expired agreement will cease to apply, except\nits terms on base salary, maternity, child, education and hazardous work\nallowances (ILO 2014). In Portugal, until 2003 a collective agreement could\nonly be cancelled if all its signatory parties agreed or if replaced by an\nagreement between the same signatories. The 2003 reform introduced the\npossibility of expiry without replacement, which led to a sharp drop in\nbargaining activity and coverage. The law was revised in 2006 and further\nrevision in 2009 introduced a reduction of the survival period to 18 months,\nreduced to one year in 2014. If the signatory parties agree to the inclusion\nof a special clause, the maximum duration permitted is since 2009 five, since\n2014 three years. As there are fewer new agreements and many workers are\ncovered only through older agreements,Footnote 8 coverage will almost\ncertainly fall sharply in years to come, unless there is a sharp uptake in\nbargaining. In Spain the 2012 reform ended the principle of indefinite\nextension of expired collective agreements and limits the \u2018after effect\u2019 of\nexpired agreements to one year. If no agreement is signed, workers will be\ncovered by a higher-level agreement if there is one. The coverage of\nagreements signed in earlier years remained high until 2012 but then dropped\nby between two and three million workers.Footnote 9 Responding to union\npressure, the central union and employers\u2019 associations agreed to advice their\naffiliates to use a speed track procedure to renew collective agreements. A\n2012 law in Estonia replaces automatic continuation of agreements beyond\nexpiry with the requirement that this should be agreed between the parties,\nlike in Scandinavia where this is regulated under the basic agreement between\ncentral organizations.\nEmployer organization across firms, within sectors or regions, is a necessary\ncondition for multi-employer bargaining. Associations must have the authority\nover and the mandate from member firms to negotiate an agreement with the\nunion(s) and bind its member firms to its terms. Employers in most Western\nEuropean countries have since 1945 organized for the purpose of bargaining,\nusually at the sectoral level, as a strategy to keep distributional conflict\naway from the workplace and wages out of competition (Sisson 1987).\nOrganization rates, measured as the share of employees working in member firms\nof employers\u2019 associations, vary from about 40 percent in Greece and Portugal\nto 80 percent or more in the Netherlands, Sweden or Finland. Unfortunately,\nthere are no reliable data for the non-European countries.\nIn the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) employers\u2019\nassociations had to be created after 1989 and outside the (former) state\nsector this has been exceedingly difficult, resulting in a rather weak and\nhighly fragmented set of organizations often incapable of extracting a mandate\nfrom their members (Bohle and Greskovits 2012; Kohl and Platzer 2004).\nSectoral agreements remain exceptional, unstable and fragmented. Slovenia has\nbeen the exception; until the law was changed in 2005 Chambers of Business\nwith compulsory membership signed collective agreements, thus assuring a\nbargaining coverage rate of hundred percent. The organization rate of\nemployers, based on voluntary membership, has since dropped to about 60\npercent, which is still much higher than elsewhere in the region.\nOutside Europe, employer organization for the purpose of bargaining is less\ncommon. In New Zealand and Australia such organizations have been involved in\nbargaining both at the national and sectoral level, but their role as\nbargaining agent has been reduced in the 1990s. There are powerful business\nassociations and in some countries, for instance in Japan, they are involved\nin coordinating annual rounds of wage bargaining, but sectoral employers\u2019\nassociations are the exception. In Japan, the Republic of Korea, Turkey after\nthe military coup of 1980, Mexico since the 1980s and in post-Pinochet Chile\nthe political and legal framework is set for enterprise bargaining in spite of\nunion attempts to establish industry bargaining in some industries, for\ninstance road transport in Chile or banking in Korea. In Israel, where the\nlast national agreement was signed in 1987, the influence of national union\nand employers\u2019 federations, and sectoral agreements, has been declining since\n(Kristal and Cohen 2007; Mundlak 2007). When American and Canadian employers\npracticed multi-employer bargaining it was on a local basis. Flanagan (1993:\n49) calls the collapse of local or regional multi-employer agreements in the\nfirst half of the 1980s \u201cthe most dramatic change in official bargaining\nstructures\u201d in the USA since the 1930s New Deal policies. The Canadian\nexperience was broadly similar, though compared with their US colleagues,\n\u201cCanadian managers appear to have been less aggressive in seeking non-union\noptions over this period of time\u201d (Kochan and Verma 1992: 198).\nTable 2 shows the scope and distribution of single-employer (enterprise) and\nmulti-employer (sector, region, national) bargaining since 2000. The first\nthing to note is that where single-employer bargaining prevails only a\nminority of workers has access to collective bargaining. Usually these are the\nworkers employed by larger firms, in parts of mining and manufacturing and in\nthe privatised utility sector (post office, railways, airlines,\ntelecommunication, et cetera), and, unless barred from collective bargaining,\nin public administration, heath and education. Only in the 14 countries with\nmulti-employer bargaining does collective bargaining reach the majority of\nworkers.\nIn Greece, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Ireland multi-\nemployer bargaining all but disappeared during the recession. But even in the\ncountries of continental North-West Europe where multi-level bargaining seems\nstable much has changed and more issues are now negotiated or decided at firm\nlevel, as I will discuss below. It is to be stressed, however, that although\nmore enterprise agreements are signed compared to ten or fifteen years ago,\ntheir weight in terms of employees covered has not. Company bargaining\nreceived a boost after the privatisation of former state companies in the\n1980s and 1990s, but there are few cases of sectoral agreements breaking up in\nfirm-level agreements, after the UK example in the 1980s. In Denmark and\nSweden separate enterprise agreements, called \u2018adhesion agreements\u2019, are\nsigned by unorganized firms under union strike pressure in order to widen the\nscope of sector agreements, not as its alternative.\nDecentralisation has been the main trend in industrial relations since the\n1980s\u2014reversing the long-term trend of previous decades, which reached its\napex during the energy and currency upheavals of the 1970s when many countries\ntried to respond to wage cost pressures with incomes policies based on central\nagreements and tripartite social pacts (Addison 1981; Armingeon 1982; Flanagan\net al. 1983). Central, cross-industry wage agreements ended in the late 1970s\nor early 1980s in Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, some\ntime later in Norway and, in the form of central award setting, in New Zealand\nand Australia in the 1990s. They continued in Finland, Belgium and Greece,\nusually with much help or pressure from the government. Tripartite social\npacts and agreements became the format for wage setting in Ireland from 1987\nto 2009, during some years in the 1980s and 1990s in Portugal, from 1994 in\nSlovenia and from 2005 in Romania. There never were central wage agreements in\nGermany, Switzerland, the UK, Canada, the USA, Japan and the other non-\nEuropean countries. The UK went through a phase of union-government \u2018social\ncontract\u2019 bargaining in the 1970s, and there were similar social pacts in\nAustralia in the 1980s, in South Korea during the Asian crisis (1997) and in\nChile after the end of dictatorship in 1990. There were sparse pacts in CEE\nand the tripartite social dialogue over the national minimum wage, introduced\nin many CEE countries during or after transition, sometimes served as an\n_Ersatz_ for wage negotiations based on bargaining power of employers and\nunions. Political and social considerations were often preponderant, but\nemployers could retaliate by not complying and payment below the minimum or\nre-arranging employment contracts in works contracts outside the scope of\nminimum wage laws was a widespread practice (EC 2004).\nIn 2008, at the beginning of the recession, there were still five countries\nwith central cross-industry pay bargaining: Belgium, Greece, Ireland,\nSlovenia, and Romania. In these countries the central agreement contained a\nprecise figure for minimum (Greece, Romania, Slovenia), standard (Ireland,) or\nmaximum (Belgium) pay rises to be detailed in sectoral and enterprise-level\nnegotiations. In Finland the central incomes policy agreement had ended a year\nearlier. In Spain the national agreement sets a framework for sectoral\nbargaining, but does not recommend a specific pay rise.\nDuring the recession central pay bargaining ended in Ireland (1987\u20132009),\nGreece (1990\u20132010) and Romania (2005\u20132010) and in these three countries\nenterprise-level bargaining now prevails. The cross-sectoral agreement in\nSlovenia, which applied to sectors and companies not covered by sectoral\ncollective bargaining, was not renewed in 2009 when it expired. There are now\nfewer sectoral agreements and in two sectors, chemicals and construction,\nemployers unilaterally cancelled the sectoral agreements in 2013. A new\nnational cross-industry agreement was signed in 2015, but its provisions deal\nwith non-wage issues only. In Greece the two general agreements signed since\n2010, the first without support from the main private sector employers\u2019\nfederation, are rather symbolic and contain no provisions on (minimum) wages.\nIn Finland, on the other hand, central pay bargaining resumed in 2011 after an\ninterlude of four years of sectoral and company bargaining. As in Belgium,\nwhere the government imposed the biennial central agreements of 2011 and 2013,\nthe government\u2019s approach was decisive in reviving (Finland) or ending\n(Greece, Romania) central-level bargaining. In Ireland and Slovenia employers\npulled out.\nAutomatic indexation of wages to prices is a proxy for centralisation. This\nmethod has survived only in Belgium and Luxembourg. Clauses in collective\nagreements with automatic indexation mechanisms triggering wage rises have\nbeen abolished in the USA (around 1980), New Zealand and Australia (1980s),\nDenmark (1983), the Netherlands (1983), Switzerland (1991), Italy (1992), and\nSweden (1993). Against the specific recommendation under the EU\u2019s new economic\ngovernance system, the Belgian government decided in 2012 to retain automatic\nwage indexation with some adjustments in the calculation. The latest central\nagreement for 2013\u201314 allows wages to rise only as much as the change in the\ncost-of-living index. In Luxembourg, which received a similar EU admonition,\nthe government failed to gain union support for reform in 2010 and went ahead\nunilaterally with suspending indexation between 2012 and 2014.\nIn Spain, pay guidelines based on inflation forecasts in the cross-sectoral\nagreements since 2002 in combination with the wage revision clauses in\nsectoral agreements which adjust wages to observed inflation operate as a form\nof \u2018soft\u2019 or \u2018non-automatic\u2019 indexation. In Italy, the cross-sector agreement\nof 2009 has adopted more or less the same model, whereas previously, based on\nthe triparite reform pact of 1993, past inflation had been the basis for wage\nadjustments in sectoral agreements. In Spain, meanwhile, there has been a\nsharp decline in the use of revision clauses. With no cross-industry agreement\nsigned in 2009, the new biennial central framework agreements reached in 2010\nand 2012 no longer incorporate official inflation forecasts. Probably\nreflecting this, the proportion of employees covered by collective agreements\nwith wage revision clauses fell from two-thirds in 2007, prior to the crisis,\nto an estimated one-third in 2012.\nDuring the Recession industry-level bargaining came under pressure in many\ncountries and in some it ended. There is no sectoral or other multi-employer\nbargaining framework in Ireland except in construction and some parts of the\nhotel business. Company level bargaining takes place in the unionised sectors\nof the economy, which is predominately made up of traditional industry and the\nsemi-state sectors (Erne 2011, Regan 2012). In Greece the general agreement\nused to be detailed in a few hundred sectoral and occupational agreements.\nDedoussopoulos et al. (2013) cites Ministry data showing that by May 2013 out\nof a total of 272 occupational or sectoral agreements existing in 2010 233 had\nbeen terminated and only 33 were renewed (6 were unaccounted for). The number\nof enterprise agreements soared from a handful to 976 in 2012, only 27 percent\nof which were signed by the unions (Ioannou and Papadimitriou 2012).\nIn Spain bargaining activity peaked in 2008 with nearly 6,000 collective\nagreements applying to 12 million workers. Both sector and company agreements\nwent into decline to a total of 4,374 in 2012 before rising to almost 4,600\nagreements in 2013. More than half of these agreements had been concluded\nbefore 2013. New agreements dropped by almost one thousand from 2,145 in 2008\nto 1,183 in 2011 before recovering in 2013\u201314. In Portugal the dramatic\ndecline in sectoral bargaining can be attributed to the severity of the\ncrisis, the stop in extension orders, the uncertainty of reforms, and the\ndivisions among unions and between unions and employers. There was hardly any\nagreement renewed in manufacturing and the construction agreement lost half\nits size. Nor were there, contrary to Greece, signs of a replacement of sector\nby enterprise bargaining. In fact, the number of enterprise agreements fell\nfrom 61 in 2010 to 29 in 2013 before rising to 80 in 2014, covering just\n12,400 employees, down from 33,000 in 2010.\nIn Italy and France, too, there were long delays in renewing existing\nagreements. According to data from the national statistical office, early 2014\nmore than half of all workers in Italy\u2019s private sector were waiting for a new\nagreement and the mean delay in contract renewal had increased to 12 months\n(almost 24 months in the cash-strapped public sector).Footnote 10 Ministry\ndata in France, early 2014, showed a 30 percent drop in the number of\n(national and regional) sector agreements compared to the year before.Footnote\n11 Already in 2011 a Ministry study complained that many (regional) sector\nagreements were characterized by \u201cune anciennet\u00e9 forte et une activit\u00e9\nconventionnelle peu dynamique\u201d.Footnote 12 In Germany and the Netherlands the\nproblems with renewing agreements also showed, especially when the recession\nended and employers offered resistance to higher wages demanded by the unions\nafter years of austerity. In Belgium there was a marked decline in sectoral\nagreements concluded under the latest central agreement, presumably because\nthere was nothing left to bargain over.\nIn CEE, already before the recession, sectoral bargaining was the exception\nrather than the rule. Under communism, wage setting had been characterized by\ncentral controls amended by informal bargaining within the enterprise. After\n1989 enterprise bargaining within the state sector replaced informal\nbargaining and had some tradition to build on. In stead, sectoral bargaining\nhad to tread entirely new grounds. The new post-1989 labour laws preparing the\nground for free collective bargaining did in most CEE countries introduce the\nconcept of multi-employer agreements but in the absence of employers\u2019\norganization the agreements that were concluded did rarely cover an entire\nsector, often contained no wage clause and did not set effective wage floors.\nIn Romania no sectoral collective agreements have been signed since 2011\nbesides a handful of agreements combining specific company groups. In\nBulgaria, the previous trend of sector agreements in manufacturing to be\nreplaced by company agreements accelerated after 2008, when employers stopped\nnegotiating at the sector level in chemicals, electrical equipment and food\nprocessing. According to a state inspectorate\u2019s report collective bargaining\nin Poland is now rare in the private sector, with hardly any sectoral\nbargaining. During the recession sectoral bargaining further weakened to the\npoint of near extinction in the private sector in Lithuania and Latvia. Gonser\n(2011) in a review of developments during the current crisis in the three\nBaltic states, claims that governments have de-legitimized collective\nbargaining as an institution by walking away from the agreements they had\nsigned as employer. In Slovakia sector agreements used to be fairly\nwidespread, but their number and coverage have declined in recent years, with\nemployers withdrawing from their organizations. K\u00e9zdi and K\u00f3nya (2011), using\nan establishment survey, affirm that sector bargaining in the private sector\nhas become rare in Hungary. In the Czech Republic since 2008 fewer collective\nagreements stipulate a specific year-on-year wage increase; in 2010 such rate\nincreases were agreed in less than half of all agreements. Even in Slovenia,\nwhere multi-employer bargaining is more established, during the recession\nbreaches of the pay guarantees in sectoral agreements soared from 462 reported\ncases in 2007 to 2,596 in 2010, followed by a slowing down, or even full stop,\nof the renewal of agreements.\nIn the context of this paper I define _decentralisation_ as moving\nnegotiations and decisions over wages and terms of employment closer to the\nindividual enterprise. Decentralisation occurs when central or sectoral\nagreements are articulated with or replaced by enterprise agreements. This\noccurs either through the breaking up of sectoral or national agreements when\nemployers stop negotiating jointly and some or all of them negotiate an\nenterprise-level agreement. Or decentralisation happens through a process of\narticulation or devolution _within_ the central or sectoral agreement when\nmore issues are settled at lower levels (Guigni 1965; Crouch 1993). Traxler\n(1995) has coined the movement of retaining sectoral (or central) bargaining\nwith more room for additional enterprise bargaining \u2018organized\ndecentralisation\u2019, which he has contrasted with \u2018disorganized\ndecentralisation\u2019 when national or sectoral agreements are ended.\nThe first step in measuring decentralisation of pay bargaining is to establish\nat which level most bargaining takes place: central, industry or sector, or\ncompany. For this I use a five-point scale allowing for two intermediary\nsituations when bargaining levels alternate between years or it is impossible\nto assess which of the two nearest levels contributes more to actual\nregulation of employment relations (see OECD 2004). A particular level is\ndominant if it accounts for at least two-thirds of bargaining in terms of\nemployees covered (as shown in Table 2). Measured on this scale the _mean_\ntrend of decentralisation of wage bargaining is clearly confirmed (Fig. 3). It\nstarted in the 1980s, intensified in the 1990s, stayed level during the decade\npreceding the crisis and received a boost during the crisis due to the end of\ncentral-level and sectoral bargaining in some countries. Among the non-\nEuropean members of the OECD and in CEE multi-level bargaining at any level\nabove the company has all but disappeared. What has happened is mostly\ndisorganized decentralization and most of it happened already one or two\ndecades before the Great Recession.\nTrends and levels in level of bargaining and decentralisation\nThe second step is to take into account the frequency and diffusion of local\n(enterprise) bargaining, the articulation between sectoral and enterprise\nbargaining, and the existence and use of general derogation clauses or \u2018open\u2019\n(framework-type) agreements that leave actual wages to be decided at\nenterprise level. According to the European Company Survey of 2009, in EU\ncountries with a dominant role for sector or central agreements, just under\nhalf of the employees covered by collective agreements fell under sector\nagreements _with_ some form of additional firm-level bargaining or pay-\nsetting. This describes the situation in manufacturing and larger firms rather\nthan in services and small and medium-sized firms. Such additional bargaining\ncan operate in different ways: (a) it is common, limited to large firms, or\nrare; (b) it is articulated and under control of the the same union(s) that\nnegotiate the sector agreement or it is unarticulated, either because it is\ndisallowed legally or involves actors other than the unions negotiating the\nsector agreement; (c) derogation from sectoral standards is defined by law,\nfully or partly disallowed, or a matter to be decided by the contracting\nparties themselves; and (d) sectoral agreements do or do not contain a general\nopening clause on wages or working hours to be negotiated at lower levels and\nwith outcomes that deviate, upwards or downwards, from sectoral standards.\nTogether and combined with the dominant level at which bargaining takes place\nthese variables define the actual level of wage bargaining or decentralisation\n(see Table 3).Footnote 13\nCountries with the same dominant level of bargaining do vary a great deal on\nthese indicators (frequency or scope of additional enterprise bargaining;\narticulation; legal status of derogation; existence and use of general opening\nclauses) and thus in actual decentralisation (Fig. 3, right panel). In\nScandinavia, local bargaining within the currency of the sectoral agreement is\ncommon (Calmfors 1990), is under union control and the enterprise has become\nthe main location for pay-setting in the entire private sector. In Germany and\nFrance additional enterprise bargaining is common in large firms, controlled\nby works councils rather than the union, and shaped by specific and\nconditional opening clauses. Such opening clauses have also figured in\nAustrian bargaining over wages and working hours, though they were not widely\nused. Individual bargaining and choice menus have shaped derogation from\nsectoral standards in the Netherland and Switzerland (Mach and Oesch 2003;\nVisser 2013). In Belgium and recently in Finland this development has affected\nissues other than wages, which tend to be specified standard or maximum rates\ndefined through central agreements. In France, Southern Europe and CEE actual\ndecentralisation happened by means of regulatory intervention, before (France,\nHungary) and during (Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Romania) the recession,\nand in some of these countries at the price of considerable disarticulation\ndue to the legal recognition of non-union actors as counterparts in enterprise\nbargaining. One main reason for this difference is that in Scandinavia, the\nNetherlands and Switzerland, as in the UK and Ireland, the hierarchy between\nagreements, and the favourability principle holding that in case of conflict\nthe first established or most favourable agreement applies is a matter of\nagreement and not of the law.\nLack of articulation has been a recurrent theme in the literature on\ncollective bargaining in Spain, Portugal, Greece and France. Costa (2012:405)\nnotes juridification, excessive competition among unions, lack of self-\nregulation and recurrent state intervention as impediments to collective\nbargaining in Portugal. Xavier (2004:194\u20135) finds collective bargaining\nincoherent \u201cbecause these forms of bargaining (i.e. interprofessional,\nsectoral, regional or company, _auth_.) are not articulated\u201d. According to\nBarreto (1992:471), \u201cthe tension between an over-regulated and highly\nlegalistic framework and voluntary collective bargaining may help explain why\nformal company bargaining is so rare in the private sector, and why industry\nbargaining has so little impact on working conditions and terms of employment\nin leading or even average enterprises.\u201d He sees this as a legacy of the\nstate-corporatist regime, which compensated the repression of unions and\nlimitations on collective bargaining by legalistic rules of protection. The\nlegal reform of 2009 introduced the possibility that in firms of 500 and more\nstaff, the works councils negotiate enterprise agreements that override the\nstandards set in sector agreements. In the Memorandum of Understanding with\nthe Troika, signed in 2011, the threshold was lowered to 250 and in the Labour\nCode of 2012 to 150. The suggestion of the Troika to strike the unions\u2019 veto\nfrom the law was not taken up and works councils can only sign agreements when\nunions allow it. The 2012 reform specifies that provisions of enterprise\nagreements take priority over those contained in sector agreement unless\nemployers and trade unions insert a clause to the contrary in sectoral\nagreements. Note that according to the European Company Survey of 2009,\nPortugal, along with Greece and some countries in CEE, had the weakest and\nleast diffused system of works councils in the EU.\nThe problem of disarticulated agreements, and the same legacy, has also beset\npost-Franco Spain. P\u00e9rez-D\u00edaz and Rodrigues (1995: 180) classify the Spanish\nbargaining system as unarticulated; provincial-based industry bargaining did\nneither create incentives nor set a floor for enterprise bargaining. In 1994\nthere was a push towards replacing the old statutes by a more dynamic system.\nFor different reasons unhappy with that reform, the central union and\nemployers\u2019 organisations signed in 1997 an agreement on collective bargaining\nwith the tacit goal of avoiding further government intervention (Garc\u00eda Blasco\nand de Val Tena 2004:217). This agreement followed the union preference for a\nmulti-level bargaining structure with limited devolution to the company level.\nThe fact that unions are only represented in larger firms (Beneyto 2008) made\nthem very reluctant to endorse devolution. The reforms of 2011 and 2012 tried\nto reverse the order: both wages and pay supplements should be set at company\nlevel, whereas non-pay issues could be dealt with in sector agreements. To\nthis end, the 2012 reform allows enterprise agreements to regulate all issue\nirrespective of what higher-order agreements stipulate. In case of disputes,\nwhen works councils want to retain sectoral norms, the law prescribes\nmandatory arbitration, thus limiting the autonomy of the social partners. In\nSpain works councils are well established in larger firms and unlike for\ninstance works councils in Germany they have a legal mandate to negotiate\ncollective agreements on wages.\nGreece\u2019s collective bargaining has been described as centralized,\nunarticulated and shallow, with various levels of bargaining co-existing but\neach level having a low capacity of regulation (Koukiadis 2009). The content\nof agreements is poor, mainly dealing with remuneration and allowances\n(Yannakourou and Soumeli 2004). Enterprise bargaining outside the state sector\nhas been rare (Zambarloukou 2006). This has dramatically changed, however. The\nMemorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF and the 2011 law for\nimplementation of the Medium-term Budgetary Strategy Framework 2012\u20132015\nprovides for the possibility of \u2018association of persons\u2019 representing a\nminimum of 60 percent of the company\u2019s staff to negotiate enterprise\nagreements, with the possibility to set wages at a lower level than provided\nin sector-level and occupational agreements.Footnote 14 This established a\nbargaining circuit outside the control of unions and contested by them.\nUntil the early 1980s industry bargaining remained dominant in France, though\nreforms to make its role more important failed (Saglio 1995). The socialist\u2019s\ngovernment\u2019s reforms of 1982\u201383 shifted the locus of bargaining to the\nenterprise, making it obligatory for employers to negotiate working hours\nchanges and instituting direct employee representation in the enterprise.\nSuccessive governments have since promoted the enterprise level as a conduit\nfor public policy interventions, further enhancing the autonomy of the\nenterprise from the wider industrial relations system, together with a\nrelocation of employee representation from the trade union to non-union, firm-\nspecific institutions in all but the largest firms (Jobert and Saglio 2005).\nIn 1995 three of the six French union confederations reached an agreement with\nemployers authorizing a mandated non-union representative to sign an\nenterprise agreement on working time. According to Howell and Kolins Givan\n(2011:243) this was a post hoc legitimization of a practice that had evolved\nsince the 1980s. \u201cA set of legal exemptions first introduced in the 1980s\nsteadily eroded the primacy of the industry level, capped by a 2004 law on\nsocial dialogue which reinforced the autonomy of firm-level negotiators in\nalmost every domain save wages.\u201d(Culpepper 2006:37). Saglio (1995:210) claims\nthat unions and employers\u2019 associations have often allowed poor enforcement of\nindustry agreements from which \u201cexceptions are now often permitted as a means\nof reducing unemployment\u201d. This development was sanctioned by the legal reform\nof 2004 which privileged standards negotiated at company level over those\nspecified in sector agreements on a range of issues except the statutory\nminimum wage and job classification. Under certain conditions trade unions, if\ngaining a majority in works council elections, can invalidate the results\n(Keune 2011). Prepared by another central agreement, signed by three of the\nsix main confederations, the 2008 legal reform makes it possible to negotiate\nagreements in smaller firms where there is no trade union presence. What has\nevolved is a disconnected _dual_ system. In large industrial firms and in the\npublic sector, where French trade unions still maintain a presence, the\ntypical deal was to exchange working time flexibility and increased\nproductivity for job security; in small firms and low-skill service sectors,\nwithout union representation, working arrangements and employment conditions\nappear to have deteriorated and external flexibility increased, without a\ntrade-off (Lallemand 2006; Palier and Thelen 2010).\nIn more countries, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, more recently in Greece,\nrecent legal reforms confer negotiating rights on works councils and non-union\nbodies _in lieu of_ trade unions. In Portugal the government, warned by the\nConstitutional Court, stepped back from removing the union veto. But it is\nclear that in all these countries, and in Spain, recent governments,\nencouraged by their international advisers, have pushed for enterprise\nbargaining in stead of sectoral bargaining and that removing the union\nmonopoly over wage bargaining is part of that push. The 2011 Social Dialogue\nAct in Romania makes collective bargaining mandatory in enterprises of 20 and\nmore workers. The criteria for trade unions to secure representativeness\nstatus as a precondition for negotiating valid agreements at sector and\ncompany levels have been tightened and where unions do not meet these criteria\nemployers can negotiate with elected non-union employee representatives. In\nHungary, the conservative government removed in 1998 the exclusive prerogative\nof unions to negotiate collective agreements and introduced a legal provision\nallowing works councils to sign collective agreements in the absence of union\norganization in the workplace. The provision was little used and repealed in\n2002, but reinstated in 2012 when Orb\u00e1n was re-elected.\nTemporary opening or \u2018inability to pay\u2019 clauses have become rather popular\nduring the Recession. They are to be distinguished from the general derogation\nclauses discussed in the previous paragraph. General derogation clauses\ndelegate particular issues to be decided at enterprise level under conditions\nspecified in the sector agreement and with outcomes that can deviate from\nsectoral minima or standards. In the limit case, as in some sector agreements\nin manufacturing in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands the\nsector agreement does not specify (minimum) pay provisions. Temporary\n\u2018inability to pay\u2019 clauses allow the suspension or renegotiation of (part of)\nthe agreement in cases of hardship, although how tightly this is defined\nvaries. General opening or derogation clauses are an instrument of organized\ndecentralisation within sectoral agreements; they have no place in enterprise\nagreements. Temporary hardship clauses can apply to any collective agreement\nat any level and rather being an element of decentralisation they are a safety\nvalve in agreements that define hard minimum or standard conditions, and in\nagreements that cover a period longer than one year.\nThe German case is an illustration of how something that began as a temporary\nlocal solution for firms to survive and for employees to rescue their jobs can\nbecome institutionalised as a permanent extra layer in collective bargaining.\nFormally, under par 4 of the German law on collective bargaining deviations\nfrom the sectoral standards set in collective agreements are only allowed when\nthe bargaining partners explicitly make a provision for them. Informally,\nhowever, informal \u2018pacts\u2019 between works councils and management, began to\nspread not long after 1990 (K\u00e4dtler 2003; Streeck 2009; Ellguth and Kohaut\n2008). Payment below the sectoral norm was practiced by about one-third of all\nfirms (Schnabel 1995:70). Attempts to move to broad framework agreements and\nleave implementation to local bargaining failed. Only around 2004 the metal-\nengineering union and the union in the chemical industry signed sector\nagreements in which they conceded the use of opening clauses under particular\nconditions and supervised at the sectoral level. According to the IAW\ncollective agreements database about half of all firms under collective\nagreements have recourse to opening clauses, though far fewer use them\n(Heinbach 2005). Addison et al. (2015b), using the IAB panel survey, report\nthat up to 40 percent of all firms under collective agreements have recourse\nto opening clauses, whereas up to 70 percent, in 2011, responded that they\nhave used these clauses. According to the IAW collective agreements database\nabout one third of the opening clauses are about pay and half are about\nworking time (Br\u00e4ndle and Heinbach 2010). Most clauses are restricted in time\nand many rely on an agreement with the union (metal-engineering) or the works\ncouncil (chemical industry). Haipeter (2013) argues that in both industries\nthe use of opening clauses has stabilised at a level of about 10 percent of\nall firms. Opening clauses in Germany has been associated with higher wage\nincreases (Fitzenberger and Franz 1999; Br\u00e4ndle and Heinbach 2010). On the\nbasis of the 2011 IAB enterprise survey Ellguth et al. (2012:9) find that\nfirms pay for these clauses with a 7 percent higher wage, but that the use of\nopening clauses triggers a reduction of 9 percent.\nSpecific one-off hardship clauses, related to the recession, in Germany\u2019s\nchemicals and metalworking sector agreements in 2009 and 2010 made it possible\nto vary the implementation of elements of the wage settlement in these years.\nIn Finland, several sector agreements in 2010 included a similar clause\nallowing individual companies to adjust the agreed wage increase to reflect\ntheir own financial circumstances. In Norway, a one-off opening clause in most\nprivate sector agreements provided local negotiators with the option not to\nimplement the sector increase agreed for 2009. Proposals of the industrial\nemployers to add specific opening clauses to industry agreements have\nroutinely been rejected by the Swedish unions. In 2009, however, under\npressure of sharply rising unemployment combined with the government\u2019s refusal\nto raise the level of unemployment benefits, the metal workers union conceded\na temporary two-years crisis agreement reminiscent of German-style opening\nclauses (Kjellberg 2012:63). In Austria, in addition, the 2011 metalworkers\u2019\ncollective agreement contains a clause allowing companies which in the last\nthree years did not have a positive operating result to split the agreed wage\nincrease for the sector in a general and a contingent part.\nIn Scandinavia there is no law that says that lower-level agreements must be\nmore favourable. In Denmark, for instance, there is nothing that stands in the\nway of temporarily lowering a given standard.Footnote 15 In the Netherlands,\ntoo, this is not a matter of law, and it is possible to gain exemptions even\nfrom an extended agreement with mandatory provisions. Yet, in neither country\nthe unions conceded a specific opening clause related to the current\nrecession, presumably because current sectoral agreements are already flexible\nenough. The same may be true for Switzerland. In both countries examples are\nfrom the past. In the Netherlands the 1982 central agreement spurred the\nadoption of a mandatory \u2018opening clause\u2019 of all agreements expiring after\nDecember 1982 allowing the suspension of price indexation in 1983 (Visser and\nHemerijck 1997). In 1993 the agreement in machine tools in Switzerland\nintroduced a temporary \u2018crisis clause\u2019 allowing firms falling on hard times to\ncancel the \u2018thirteenth month salary\u2019 and to increase working time without\nincreasing wages (Bonoli and Mach 2000:158). The use of opening clauses in\nBelgium seems to be exceptional in the present recession (Keune 2011) and the\nlaw does not provide for exemptions, however in practice sectorally defined\nstandards may be derogated from if the agreement explicitly allows for this\nthrough opt-out clauses. Three of the six main union confederations signed in\n2013 a central agreement in France, subsequently enacted as law, introducing\nthe possibility of derogation from sectoral standards for companies in\neconomic difficulty subject to commitments to refrain from implementing\nredundancies.\nIn Southern Europe the hierarchical layering of agreements based on the\nfavourability principle has usually found strict legal application (Sciarra\n2006). However, under heavy international pressure, recent legal changes have\nopened Pandora\u2019s box. In Italy lowering sectorally agreed pay norms had been\npossible from 2001 in some \u2018underdeveloped\u2019 regions with high unemployment if\nthere is a tripartite employment pact. The tripartite national pact of 2009,\nwithout approval of the largest union confederation, conceded the possibility\nto suspend the sectoral wage increase in firms that had fallen on hard times.\nIn 2010 Fiat tested the pact by a round of concession bargaining including\nradical changes in working practices and dismissal protection in two of its\nplants, on threat of closure and relocation. Workers voted in favour in\nballots organized by the company and the two plants were removed from the\nsector agreement. Soon after Fiat withdrew from the sector agreement. In June\n2011 a new central agreement, with the signature of all three union\nconfederations, stipulated that enterprise agreements can introduce temporary\nand experimental modifications of provisions in sector agreements within\nestablished limits and with approval by a majority of union delegates at the\nlocal level. These new rules have been applied in a few industry agreements\nsince. When in August 2011 the government introduced, under pressure of the\nECB, a decree-law with the possibility of derogation, by collective agreement,\nfrom legally-established dismissal protection guarantees, the main employers\u2019\nconfederation could only rescue the central agreement it had just signed by\npromising not to use the new law. This has prompted Fiat to leave the\nconfederation.\nIn Spain there had been attempts to apply \u2018inability to pay\u2019 clauses in\ncollective agreements even before the Recession. The 2010 legal reform widened\nthe scope for the non-application of higher-level agreements on wages and\nother working conditions, especially working hours, at company level (Molina\nand Migu\u00e9lez 2013: 23). The 2011 reform, still by the socialist government,\naimed at giving priority to enterprise bargaining. In their framework\nagreement, of February 2012 the central union and employers\u2019 associations took\nthis up and allowed a greater use of opening clauses on a wider range of\nissues\u2014working time, remuneration systems, shift work and work organization.\nThese opting-out clauses can only be applied in case of a persistent drop of\nrevenues, but that should not have been a major constraint during the deep\nrecession in which the Spanish economy found itself. In Greece, a 2010 law\nintroduced scope for company agreements to derogate from the wage and working\ntime provisions of sector agreements in cases of economic hardship. The 2011\nreform radicalized this by making sector and cross-sector agreements redundant\nregarding wages.\nIrish and British collective agreements do not establish legally binding norms\nand there are no legal rules on favourability or opening clauses. Under the\nrules of the social pacts, until 2009, Irish companies could claim inability\nto pay, though the unions frequently fiercely contested such claims,\nespecially where unions had no access to company financial data. New Irish\nlegislation for collective agreements regulating the minimum wage in some\nsectors like cleaning, catering or construction sets out a detailed process by\nwhich individual firms can seek temporary derogation on grounds of inability\nto pay. These exemptions can last from 3 to 24 months and, in order to avoid\nabuse, employers cannot quality for exemption twice.\nIn CEE, companies falling on hard times often pay less than stipulated in the\ncollective agreement and, even, below the mandatory minimum wage. For this\nthey do not need opening clauses, besides the fact that most bargaining takes\nplace at enterprise level. Some laws on collective bargaining, for instance in\nthe Czech Republic and Slovakia, exclude derogation and forbid agreeing terms\nthat are less favourable than those stipulated in the law or in higher-order\nagreements. The result is that in times of economic stress fewer agreements\nare signed and fewer agreements contain a wage rise guarantee.\nIn Poland it is rare for a collective agreement in the private sector to\nprovide for wage and terms of employment that are more favourable than the\nminimum stipulated in the law. Many agreements stipulate conditions even below\nlegal standards, although the proportion of agreements with sub-minimal norms\nappears to have decreased from about one-half to one-fifth of all agreements\nbetween 2005 and 2009, according to the state\u2019s inspectorate. In 2002 the then\nsocialist government felt it necessary to amend the law and allow for the\nsuspension of (clauses in) the collective agreement in case of financial\nhardship. The idea seems to have been that this additional flexibility would\nmake collective bargaining more attractive for employers. The incidence of\nsuch hardship clauses increased in following years, but bargaining activity\n(number and coverage of agreements) decreased. Firms facing financial\ndifficulties did not go to the trouble of suspending or renegotiating\nparticular provisions in the collective agreement but rescinded the agreement\ninstead (Towalski 2005).\nSlovenia has a tighter regime of collective bargaining and in response to the\ngrowing number of firms finding themselves in breach with the sectoral\nagreement by delaying or not paying the agreed wages, the 2009 cross-sectoral\nagreement did contain an opening clause allowing companies operating at a\ndeficit to postpone the basic pay rise by six months, subject to agreement\nwith the local (company) union representatives.\nBargaining coordination has been widely used and preferred over centralisation\nas an indicator to assess and explain wage developments (Soskice 1990; Nickell\n1997; OECD 1997, 2004). It is defined as the integration or synchronization of\npay policies of distinct bargaining units (Soskice 1990; Traxler and Brandl\n2012) or \u201cthe degree to which minor players deliberately follow along with\nwhat major players decide\u201d (Kenworthy 2001:75). While full centralisation and\nfull coordination amount to the same (Soskice 1990), fully decentralised\nbargaining, at the level of companies, might be highly coordinated, for\ninstance if all negotiations are conducted by the same union, or employers\ntake advice from one major association before signing agreements. These\nexamples are extreme but not fanciful. Austria comes close to the situation of\none union (federation) monopolizing all employee representation existing in\nthe country; the General Employers\u2019 Association in the Netherlands, while not\nsigning agreements, assists in the preparation and negotiations of most of the\nfive to seven hundred company agreements concluded each year. Conversely,\nhighly centralised bargaining at the level of peak-level confederations can be\nrather uncoordinated, when there is poor monitoring and implementation at\nlower levels.\nIn order to rank the extent of wage bargaining coordination from high (5) to\nlow (1) I have followed Kenworthy\u2019s indicator of the \u201cdegree, rather than the\ntype, of coordination\u201d (2001:78), which links particular institutional\nfeatures, as identified in Traxler et al. (2001), to more or less\ncoordination. I have adjusted his scores and distinguish between coordination\nbased on the issuing (by central agreement, government order, or a combination\nof these) of a binding ceiling or maximum/minimum rate of wage increases (=5);\nof wage norms, guidelines, patterns or recommendations issued by central\norganizations or established by a dominant sector, union or employers\u2019\nassociation (=4); of negotiation (and conflict mediation) procedures and\nguidelines issued by central organizations for lower-level bargainers (=3);\nsome form of government coordination through the setting of minimum wage or\npublic sector examples (=2); or none of the above (=1) (Table 4).\nBased on this scale, there is a clear divergence between the mean level and\ndevelopment of coordination in Western Europe, the CEE and the non-European\ncountries of the OECD (Fig. 4, left panel). Outside Europe any degree of\ncoordination beyond state guidance through minimum wage setting or public\nsector wages is rare. This has not changed much during the recession: there\nwas little wage coordination and this has remained to be the case. Japan and\nto a lesser extent Korea are the exceptions. Taking the annual wage increase\nset by the leading firms in major industries as benchmark, in both countries\nsmaller companies, government agencies, and non-unionized employees negotiate\ntheir wages during one annual round (Sako 1997).\nTrends and variations in wage bargaining coordination\nIn CEE there were attempts at coordination before the recession in some\ncountries. In Romania the termination of national, cross-sector agreements has\nweakened coordination across sectors, especially now wage bargaining has moved\nto the company level and most employees are no longer covered by collective\nbargaining arrangements. Slovenia had been the exception among the post-\ncommunist countries with a rather highly organized system of industrial\nrelations (Bohle and Greskovits 2012) and it has been \u201cthe only post-communist\nsociety where social pacts have been concluded systematically since the\nmid-1990s and have also been influential \u2026 (Stanojevi\u0107 and Kra\u0161ovec\n2011:232)\u201d. However, during the recession this ended and with fewer sectoral\nand no cross-sectoral agreement on wages, there is much less coordination than\nin the past. In Hungary, until 2011, employers and trade unions, although very\ndivided and fragmented, issued a joint recommendation for wage increases\nwithin the framework of the now abolished tripartite consultation body. Since\n2011 the government issues its own recommendations, but it is unclear whether\nthese are followed. In Slovakia, countering the weakening of sectoral\nbargaining, the existing informal coordination across sectors was in 2013\naugmented by the establishment of a formal bi-partite social dialogue\narrangement for industry. Elsewhere in CEE, for instance in the Czech Republic\nwhere the government froze the statutory minimum wage for several years after\n2008, the minimum wages is used as a tool to send messages to wage bargainers.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4 (right panel) the level of coordination of wage\nbargaining has been rather stable in most countries in Western Europe with\nonly some dramatic changes.\nWith the end of the national agreement in 2010, government\u2019s intervention was\nthe only source of coordination in Greece. There is some evidence that before\n2010 \u2018protected\u2019 sectors (the public utilities and state monopolies such as\nelectricity, telecommunications, airways, banking, railways, etc.) had a wage-\nleadership role, compared to the \u2018exposed\u2019 sectors mainly in manufacturing and\ncommerce.\u201d (Ioannou 1998:103), but that surely ended and the current situation\nis one of enterprise bargaining with no horizontal coordination. Ireland has\nmoved back to mostly uncoordinated company-level bargaining after the end of\n22 years of tripartite wage agreements. The Irish trade union confederation\nand business association did not break off relationships altogether but signed\na protocol with some ground rules for company-level negotiations but these do\nneither try to provide horizontal coordination on pay demands or settlements\nnor do they establish firm rules for settling conflicts over union\nrecognition, a hotly disputed issue already before the break down of social\npartnership (Regan 2013).\nBelgium continued with central wage settlements, since 2011 imposed by the\ngovernment and within narrow margins set by legislation tying maximum wage\nincreases to developments in neighbouring countries. Finland has returned to\ntripartite incomes policy pacts. \u201cThere are a limited number of things that\nFinland can affect on its own\u201d-- so Finland\u2019s prime minister (and current EU\nCommissioner) Jyrki Katainen when the deal for 2011\u201312 was announced -- \u201cA pay\ncontract supporting industrial peace and competitiveness, purchasing power and\nemployment is in our hands.\u201d In the Netherlands the main union confederations\nhas since 1993 issued an annual recommendation on maximum wage increases,\ndepending on past developments in inflation and productivity, and in any given\nyear actual wage increases have stayed below this maximum (De Beer 2013). At\ntimes of economic downturn the government works hard and is usually capable to\ncast a \u201cshadow of hierarchy\u201d over bargaining tables in order to obtain a\ncommitment to additional wage moderation (Visser and Van der Meer 2011).\nModeration of wage demands in 2009\u201310 was tied to government and employer\nsupport for financing temporary shorter working hours, following the\nsuccessful German example in metal engineering. In Italy the central\norganizations of unions and employers have set rules for sectoral and company\nbargaining through tripartite pacts (1993; 1998; 2009), but especially the\n2009 pact was disputed by the largest union confederation and caused disunity\nwithin the employer camp, later followed by the exit of Fiat from the\nemployers\u2019 confederation. In Spain, the annual cross-sectoral agreements\nbetween the central union and employers\u2019 organizations included from 2002 to\n2008 rules as well as pay guidelines for sector and company negotiators based\non inflation estimates. No agreement was reached in 2009, but in following\nyears central coordination on bargaining rules was resumed without indexation-\nbased pay recommendations.\nTrendsetting arrangements have become dominant in Austria, Denmark, Norway,\nand Sweden, and always were in Germany. Outside Europe, the Australian award\nsystem created in its high days an \u201calmost automatic transmission of wage\ngains from one sector to another\u201d (Schwartz 2000:76) but this ended before the\n1980s when coordination of union wage behaviour was based on an Accord with\nthe government. After several modifications this ended in the 1990s and with\nthe present mix of industry and company bargaining there is little\ncoordination. In the USA pattern bargaining had been strongest in the auto-\nindustry and \u201cinformally had served to centralize bargaining at the multi-\nemployer level\u201d (Katz 1993:11), but within and between industries pattern\nsetting weakened and became ineffective in the 1980s.\nA high level of employer organization and strong unions, especially in\nmanufacturing, combined with pattern bargaining allowed Germany in the 1970s\nand 1980s to emulate the high degree of wage bargaining coordination found in\nScandinavia during these years. With IG Metall as pacesetter, \u201cother\nindustries settled wage increases within 1 percent of the engineering\nagreement.\u201d (Jacobi et al. 1992:248).\u201cThis model has survived the turbulence\nof German reunification and declining rates of organization in manufacturing,\nboth on the employers\u2019 and unions\u2019 side. Still, IG Metall is very powerful and\nacts as the pace-setter, for instance in the initial phase of the recession\nwhen it negotiated a \u2018shorter working hours\u2019 schedule and, in direct contact\nwith the government, a car wrecking subsidy scheme.\nSince the early 1980s, the metal-engineering industry has de facto gained the\nrole of wage leader in Austria (Traxler 1998). Whether this will change after\nthe decision of employers, in 2012, to leave the joint bargaining platform of\nthe six branches making up the metalworking sector and sign separate\nagreements is as yet unclear. Thus far, it appears that the six agreements\nresemble each other. However, it sets a clear sign that employers want more\ndifferentiation.\nCoordination based on trendsetting is of a more recent vintage in Scandinavia.\nThe change from central level bargaining to coordinated industry bargaining,\nfollowing the pattern set by the main agreements in the exposed sector, meant\nthat wage leadership shifted from unskilled workers in the private and public\nsectors (the main benefactors of central agreements) to the skilled workers in\nthe private (exposed) sector, with an increased role for salaried employees in\nlater years (B\u00f8je and Madsen 1994; Due et al. 1994; Iversen 1999). In each of\nthese countries the changes started in the 1980s, but it took till the early\n(Denmark), mid (Norway) or late 1990s (Sweden) before a stable wage leadership\nwas established (Scheuer 1998; Elvander 2002; Vartiainen 2001; Kjellberg\n2012).\nThe effectiveness of trend-setting arrangements depends on whether the\nnegotiators of the pattern setting agreement are able and willing to\n\u2018internalize\u2019 the pressures of international competitiveness and changing\nlabour markets. This might be the case if the internationally exposed sector\ntakes the lead. The stability of pattern setting, including wage moderation if\nneed be, depends on a degree of centralisation and authority that is perhaps\nless than central wage bargaining but still formidable. This is nowhere\nclearer than in Austria where both the union and employers\u2019 side hold an\nabsolute monopoly of representation, backed by the law, and can therefore not\nbe challenged from without. In Germany it is the sheer might of the IG Metall\nin combination with the size, success and prestige of the car industry. In\nNorway and Denmark it is possible to end disputes over the renewal of\nagreements by means of a single mediation procedure for the entire private\nsector, empowering the mediator to treat several settlements as one entity in\nthe ballot (Elvander 2003). This is a strong centralising element in an\notherwise decentralised system of wage setting like the Danish one and a\nmethod to gag independent unions and out-of-step employers, for instance in\nthe Norwegian oil industry. Mediation institutions were set up in all four\nNordic countries in the early 20th century (Elvander 1990), but these\ninstitutions have been weaker in Sweden, where a strong doctrine of freedom\nfrom state interference in these matters had prevailed (Elvander 2002:210).\nThis was addressed in the 1997 Industry Agreement between the industrial\nengineering employers and a cartel of ten unions. The agreement established a\nprivate-law mediation institute, a permanent joint structure with impartial\nchairpersons for negotiations and a sectoral Economic Council with four\nindependent academic economists. Elvander and Holmlund (1997) judge these\ninstitutions as prerequisite for decentralized wage formation in a highly\norganized economy with powerful unions. In 2009 the employers in industrial\nengineering Employers Federation gave notice to the 1997 agreement, but it was\nrenewed in 2011 with more power for impartial mediators, stricter negotiation\nrules and stronger incentives to maintain the manufacturing industry\u2019s wage\nleadership role. This came after a challenge during the recession, when some\nunions pushed hard for the norm to be set by the commercial services sector\nrather than by a manufacturing sector which was experiencing tremendous\ndifficulties in exports and sales, and was rapidly losing jobs (Kjellberg\n2012). In the 2011 bargaining rounds, following some recovery, the industry\nsector prevailed however, though with the salaried employees rather than the\nblue-collar unions, settling first and thus establish the pattern.\nFrance is the most prominent case of state-guided coordination (Crouch 1993;\nCulpepper 2006). The Salaire Minimum Interprofessionelle Garantie (SMIC) was\nand still is a central instrument in shoring up France\u2019s entire wage\nstructure. Setting its level became highly politicized, playing big in\npresidential elections. State guidance through setting the minimum wage or\nawards is primordial in France, Australia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria,\nTurkey, Israel and, since 2010, in Greece and Portugal. During the recession\ngovernment control over minimum wage setting has increased through the removal\nof the social partners from decision making over minimum wage levels (Greece,\nHungary, Spain, Latvia), or by freezing (Ireland, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania,\nCzech Republic), (partially) de-indexing (Belgium, Luxembourg) or lowering\n(Greece) the statutory minimum wage. Minimum wage setting by the government\nmay have a big knock-on effect on private sector wage bargaining, especially\nwhere there is a large low wage sector and where wage bargaining institutions\nare weak or have weakened, as indicated by low and declining coverage rates,\narrears in the renewal of agreements, and arrears in pay.\nSumming up, the divide within Europe and between a part of Western Europe\n(plus Japan and Korea?) and the rest of the OECD universe has become sharper.\nHigh bargaining coverage and bargaining coordination tend to go together, and\nso do low coverage and coordination ( _r_ = .70, for 37 countries, 2010\u201314).\nThus, at higher levels of bargaining coverage (and unionization), governments,\nemployers\u2019 associations and union federations appear to invest more in the co-\nordination of wage bargaining. It is at very low levels of unionization and\nbargaining coverage that wage bargaining is allowed to go un-coordinated.\nCollective bargaining and many of its underpinning laws and institutions are\nthe product of major crises, not least the Great Depression of the 1930s,\nwhich became the inspiration for multi-employer bargaining and the rules that\nfor half a century and longer ensured wide-ranging coverage of wage\nagreements. In the United States these were the founding years of industrial\nunions organizing across firms in mass production industries. In post-war\nWestern Europe multi-employer bargaining at national and sectoral levels\nbecame the cornerstone not only of wage setting but also of labour market\nregulation more generally. After 1989 the labour laws in post-communist Europe\nmade explicitly room for multi-employer bargaining. Although collective\nbargaining changed in many ways both in content and structure, the multi-\nemployer nature of bargaining remained remarkably stable, at least in\ncontinental Western Europe and until the Great Recession.\nThe recommendations of the Euro-Plus Pact of March 2011, the supervisory\nmechanism in the \u2018Six Pack\u2019 of regulations on economic governance adopted by\nthe European Council in October 2011, and the Memoranda of Understanding\nbetween the troika of European and international institutions (the European\nCentral Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund) and\nnational governments in countries receiving financial assistance, goes\ninvariably in the direction of reforms that weaken multi-employer bargaining\nand coordination across bargaining units. This is the exact opposite of the\nlessons and policies with which the industrialised democracies had tried to\ndefeat the economic and political misery and upheavals of the 1930s and 1940s.\nUndoubtedly, labour markets changed in these eighty years - more technology,\neducation, women, and probably also more rights and democracy in the\nworkplace, as well as fiercer international competition on a global scale and\nintensely restless financial movements and interests - but one wonders how\nstrong the evidence against multi-employer bargaining is that the destruction\nof its supporting institutions is currently taken for granted by so many\ngovernments.\nIn the 1980s the United Kingdom had been the first and only European country\nwith a government determined to end the prevailing system of multi-employer\nbargaining. Its approach had been preceded in the USA and found followers in\nNew Zealand and Australia, but none in Europe. In the 1990s as part of its\n\u2018Jobs Strategy\u2019, the OECD advised its members to \u201crefocus collective\nbargaining at sectoral level to framework agreements, in order to give firms\nmore leeway to adjust wages to local conditions; introduce opening clauses for\nlocal bargaining parties to renegotiate sector agreements; (and) phase out\nadministrative extension\u201d (OECD 1994). These are the policies advocated, with\nmore coercion, by the international institutions (IMF, EU, ECB) as part of\ntheir financial assistance programs during the current recession and\nsouvereign debt crisis. Ten or fifteen years ago the OECD\u2019s advise had no\ntakers (OECD 1999) and in a follow up analysis in 2004 the organization\nadmitted that the evidence had probably not been as straightforward and\nconvincing as had been presented in the 1994 study (OECD 2004). In addition to\n\u201cpersistent doubts concerning the efficacy of the policy recommendations\u201d\n(OECD 2004:132), the organization conceded that the general trends of rising\nwage inequality and persistence of low pay had made governments wary of\ninstituting reforms that tend to make such trends worse (ibid.). The OECD also\nnoted that the power of governments in this policy domain is often limited,\nnot only because of union opposition, but also because wage-setting\ninstitutions \u201care deeply embedded in the social and economic fabric\u201d of member\nstates (ibid.). Apparently, it needs a severe crisis and much international\npressure to disembed wage bargaining institutions. In its final evaluation of\nthe Jobs Strategy, the OECD concluded that under conditions of efficient\ncoordination inclusive bargaining models (based on wide-ranging coverage,\nachieved with some form of centralised or coordinated bargaining, the help of\nadministrative extension, and/or high rates of unionisation) can perform as\ngood as the exclusive, decentralised systems it had initially recommended\n(OECD 2006).\nAs we have seen in the pages before, the Great Recession and its Aftermath\nintensified rather than changed developments in wage bargaining institutions,\nlike decreasing bargaining coverage, lower unionization levels, and\ndecentralisation of wage bargaining. The regulatory changes, concentrated in\nSouthern and Eastern Europe, contributed to what appears to be a convergent\nglobal trend to \u201crestoring market control by making the basis for organised\ninterests smaller and more exclusive\u201d (Goldthorpe 1984: 330), a trend in which\nEuropean wage bargaining institutions become more similar to what is the norm\noutside Europe. This shrinkage of collective representation and bargaining is\nthe expression of, and a contribution to, the observed rise in inequalities in\nthe labour market and in society (Jaumotte and Buitron 2015).\nIn one aspect - state intervention and the conspicuous absence of social pacts\n- the Great Recession appears to present a _political_ break with developments\nsince the 1990s, however. The European Commisson\u2019s most recent report on\nIndustrial Relations in Europe (EC 2015) notes that as regards state\nintervention in wage setting, there is no overall common trend across EU\nMember States. Whereas before the crisis there were signs of less direct state\nintervention both inside and outside Europe, during the Recession governments\nin Europe have become more involved in wage-setting. Again, this is especially\ntrue for EU Member States receiving external financial support, such as\nRomania, Greece, Portugal and Spain, where government interventions have\nreduced the scope for collective bargaining and pushed disorganised\ndecentralisation. In Italy, under pressure of the European Central Bank, the\ngovernment tried to force change upon employers and unions, and in Belgium and\nLuxembourg, over the issue of indexation, governments were under pressure of\nthe European Commission, though in Belgium and Italy the unions were less\neasily pushed aside. But generally in these and other countries where the\nrules on minimum wage setting, extension, treatment of expired agreements,\nenterprise agreements, hierarchy of bargaining levels, union recognition and\nopening clauses have been changed, \u201cgovernment imposition was a more prevalent\ninstitutional source of change than negotiation between employers and trade\nunions for a larger number of changes\u201d (Marginson and Welz 2014).\nThis stands in contrast to the trend towards more social dialogue and search\nfor concerted policies in the years prior to the Great Recession, both inside\nand outside Europe (Fraile and Baccaro 2010; Avdagi\u0107 et al. 2011). Social\npacts, defined as policy contracts between governments, trade unions and\nemployers\u2019 associations over wage, labour market and welfare policies, had\nbeen rediscovered in the 1990s as instruments to gain the support of unions\nfor wage moderation and reforms in wage setting, for instance in preparation\nof a common monetary policy and currency (Pochet and Fajertag 2000).\nConsidering cases as different as Slovenia, Poland, South Korea and Chile,\nFraile and Baccaro (2010) find support for the hypothesis that these pacts,\nwhile not changing the (neo-liberal) direction of change moderated its pace,\nprovided compensation for those groups and interests that were losing due to\nchanges and thus made reform more politically sustainable. During the Great\nRecession wage setting reform pacts are conspicuous by their absence and\ninternational pressure appears to have substituted for the search for domestic\nconsensus.\nThis conclusion is supported by the finding that in the countries hit hardest\nduring the recession and with the largest number of regulatory changes, wage\nbargaining coordination has more or less disappeared (Fig. 4). The Great\nRecession has sharpened the divide between a smaller group of countries with\nmore cohesive and coordinated industrial relations and wage bargaining\ninstitutions, and lower inequality levels, and a larger group of countries\nwhere \u2018markets make policies\u2019, wage bargaining institutions are divisive and\nuncoordinated, and income inequality levels are higher.\nI want to thank Tony Atkinson, Georg Fisher, Juan Jimeno, Olivier Blanchard,\nPrakash Loungani, and the anonymous reviewer of this journal, for their\ninspiring comments, questions and suggestions.

The construction of the variables in this paper (adjusted coverage,\nextension regimes, dominant level of bargaining, articulation, additional\nenterprise bargaining, opening clauses, decentralisation, and coordination) is\nexplained in the ICTWSS codebook and available with the dataset.\nAll current (34) member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD) plus EU Members Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and\nRomania.\nThe _observed_ coverage rate includes employees directly covered through their\nmembership of a union or employment in a firm directly bound by collective\nagreement as well as employees who are bound due to the extension of the\nagreement to non-organized firms. The separate effect of extension orders are\ndiscussed below.\nUnion density and bargaining coverage rate are calculated in the same way, as\nthe proportion of employees who have taken up membership of a union and\nemployees whose terms of employment are covered by a collective agreement.\nBesides a few countries were the data are derived from household or labour\nmarket surveys, the data are from administrative records. Union density rates\nare calculated net of retired, unemployed and self-employed members;\nbargaining coverage rates are calculated on the basis of \u2018existing\u2019\nagreements, including those that have been concluded in earlier years. This\ntends to produce an inflated bargaining coverage rate when agreements have no\nexpiration date, have not been renewed on a regular basis and are treated as\nvalid even when expired. For and explication and example, see the note on\nPortugal (Additional file 1).\nFrom 1960 to 1989 the average length of union recognition elections increased\nfrom 54 days to 212 days, with ever fewer cases won by the unions (Peters\n2005). The hostilities produced during these elections was such that it became\nless and less like that there will be a collective agreement.\nCalculated from \u201cQuadros de Pessoal\u201d 1999\u20132014; Minist\u00e9rio da Solidariedade e\nSeguran\u00e7a Social. http://www.gep.msess.gov.pt/estatistica/gerais, and\nDirectorate of labour relations, DGERT, _Varia\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia ponderada\nintertabelas_ and _DGERT, Instrumentos de regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o colectiva de trabalho\npublicados;_ GEE, Boletim Estat\u00edstico, January 2014 and January 2015.\n_Quadros de Pessaol_ , Minist\u00e9rio da Solidariedade e Seguran\u00e7a Social.\nhttp://www.gep.msess.gov.pt/estatistica/gerais.\nMinisterio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

It also describes a field of study dedicated to\nexamining such relationships. The field is an outgrowth of the industrial\nrevolution, whose excesses led to the emergence of trade unions to represent\nworkers and to the development of collective labour relations. A labour or\nindustrial relations system reflects the interaction between the main actors\nin it: the state, the employer (or employers or an employers\u2019 association),\ntrade unions and employees (who may participate or not in unions and other\nbodies affording workers\u2019 representation). The phrases \u201clabour relations\u201d and\n\u201cindustrial relations\u201d are also used in connection with various forms of\nworkers\u2019 participation; they can also encompass individual employment\nrelationships between an employer and a worker under a written or implied\ncontract of employment, although these are usually referred to as \u201cemployment\nrelations\u201d. There is considerable variation in the use of the terms, partly\nreflecting the evolving nature of the field over time and place. There is\ngeneral agreement, however, that the field embraces collective bargaining,\nvarious forms of workers\u2019 participation (such as works councils and joint\nhealth and safety committees) and mechanisms for resolving collective and\nindividual disputes. The wide variety of labour relations systems throughout\nthe world has meant that comparative studies and identification of types are\naccompanied by caveats about the limitations of over-generalization and false\nanalogies. Traditionally, four distinct types of workplace governance have\nbeen described: dictatorial, paternalistic, institutional and worker-\nparticipative; this chapter examines primarily the latter two types.\nBoth private and public interests are at stake in any labour relations system.\nThe state is an actor in the system as well, although its role varies from\nactive to passive in different countries. The nature of the relationships\namong organized labour, employers and the government with respect to health\nand safety are indicative of the overall status of industrial relations in a\ncountry or an industry and the obverse is equally the case. An underdeveloped\nlabour relations system tends to be authoritarian, with rules dictated by an\nemployer without direct or indirect employee involvement except at the point\nof accepting employment on the terms offered.\nA labour relations system incorporates both societal values (e.g., freedom of\nassociation, a sense of group solidarity, search for maximized profits) and\ntechniques (e.g., methods of negotiation, work organization, consultation and\ndispute resolution). Traditionally, labour relations systems have been\ncategorized along national lines, but the validity of this is waning in the\nface of increasingly varied practices within countries and the rise of a more\nglobal economy driven by international competition. Some countries have been\ncharacterized as having cooperative labour relations models (e.g., Belgium,\nGermany), whereas others are known as being conflictual (e.g., Bangladesh,\nCanada, United States). Different systems have also been distinguished on the\nbasis of having centralized collective bargaining (e.g., those in Nordic\ncountries, although there is a move away from this, as illustrated by Sweden),\nbargaining at the sectoral or industrial level (e.g., Germany), or bargaining\nat the enterprise or plant level (e.g., Japan, the United States). In\ncountries having moved from planned to free-market economies, labour relations\nsystems are in transition. There is also increasing analytical work being done\non the typologies of individual employment relationships as indicators of\ntypes of labour relations systems.\nEven the more classic portrayals of labour relations systems are not by any\nmeans static characterizations, since any such system changes to meet new\ncircumstances, whether economic or political. The globalization of the market\neconomy, the weakening of the state as an effective force and the ebbing of\ntrade union power in many industrialized countries pose serious challenges to\ntraditional labour relations systems. Technological development has brought\nchanges in the content and organization of work that also have a crucial\nimpact on the extent to which collective labour relations can develop and the\ndirection they take. Employees\u2019 traditionally shared work schedule and common\nworkplace have increasingly given way to more varied working hours and to the\nperformance of work at varied locations, including home, with less direct\nemployer supervision. What have been termed \u201catypical\u201d employment\nrelationships are becoming less so, as the contingent workforce continues to\nexpand. This in turn places pressure on established labour relations systems.\nNewer forms of employee representation and participation are adding an\nadditional dimension to the labour relations picture in a number of countries.\nA labour relations system sets the formal or informal ground rules for\ndetermining the nature of collective industrial relations as well as the\nframework for individual employment relationships between a worker and his or\nher employer. Complicating the scene at the management end are additional\nplayers such as temporary employment agencies, labour contractors and job\ncontractors who may have responsibilities towards workers without having\ncontrol over the physical environment in which the work is carried out or the\nopportunity to provide safety training. In addition, public sector and private\nsector employers are governed by separate legislation in most countries, with\nthe rights and protections of employees in these two sectors often differing\nsignificantly. Moreover, the private sector is influenced by forces of\ninternational competition that do not directly touch public-sector labour\nrelations.\nFinally, neoliberal ideology favouring the conclusion of individualized\nemployment contracts to the detriment of collectively bargained arrangements\nposes another threat to traditional labour relations systems. Those systems\nhave developed as a result of the emergence of collective representation for\nworkers, based on past experience that an individual worker\u2019s power is weak\nwhen compared to that of the employer. Abandoning all collective\nrepresentation would risk returning to a nineteenth century concept in which\nacceptance of hazardous work was largely regarded as a matter of individual\nfree choice. The increasingly globalized economy, the accelerated pace of\ntechnological change and the resultant call for greater flexibility on the\npart of industrial relations institutions, however, pose new challenges for\ntheir survival and prosperity. Depending upon their existing traditions and\ninstitutions, the parties involved in a labour relations system may react\nquite differently to the same pressures, just as management may choose a cost-\nbased or a value-added strategy for confronting increased competition (Locke,\nKochan and Piore, 1995). The extent to which workers\u2019 participation and/or\ncollective bargaining are regular features of a labour relations system will\nmost certainly have an impact on how management confronts health and safety\nproblems.\nMoreover, there is another constant: the economic dependence of an individual\nworker on an employer remains the underlying fact of their relationship\u2013one\nthat has serious potential consequences when it comes to safety and health.\nThe employer is seen as having a general duty to provide a safe and healthful\nworkplace and to train and equip workers to do their jobs safely. The worker\nhas a reciprocal duty to follow safety and health instructions and to refrain\nfrom harming himself/herself or others while at work. Failure to live up to\nthese or other duties can lead to disputes, which depend on the labour\nrelations system for their resolution. Dispute resolution mechanisms include\nrules governing not only work stoppages (strikes, slowdowns or go-slows, work\nto rule, etc.) and lockouts, but the discipline and dismissal of employees as\nwell. Additionally, in many countries employers are required to participate in\nvarious institutions dealing with safety and health, perform safety and health\nmonitoring, report on-the-job accidents and diseases and, indirectly, to\ncompensate workers who are found to be suffering from an occupational injury\nor disease.\nHuman resources management has been defined as \u201cthe science and the practice\nthat deals with the nature of the employment relationship and all of the\ndecisions, actions and issues that relate to that relationship\u201d (Ferris, Rosen\nand Barnum 1995; see figure 21.1). It encapsulates employer-formulated\npolicies and practices that see the utilization and management of employees as\na business resource in the context of a firm\u2019s overall strategy to enhance\nproductivity and competitiveness. It is a term most often used to describe an\nemployer\u2019s approach to personnel administration that emphasizes employee\ninvolvement, normally but not always in a union-free setting, with the goal of\nmotivating workers to enhance their productivity. The field was formed from a\nmerger of scientific management theories, welfare work and industrial\npsychology around the time of the First World War and has undergone\nconsiderable evolution since. Today, it stresses work organization techniques,\nrecruitment and selection, performance appraisal, training, upgrading of\nskills and career development, along with direct employee participation and\ncommunication. Human resources management has been put forth as an alternative\nto \u201cFordism\u201d, the traditional assembly-line type of production in which\nengineers are responsible for work organization and workers\u2019 assigned tasks\nare divided up and narrowly circumscribed. Common forms of employee\ninvolvement include suggestion schemes, attitude surveys, job enrichment\nschemes, teamworking and similar forms of empowerment schemes, quality of\nworking-life programmes, quality circles and task forces. Another feature of\nhuman resources management may be linking pay, individually or collectively,\nto performance. It is noteworthy that one of the three objectives of\noccupational health has been identified by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on\nOccupational Health as \u201cdevelopment of work organizations and working cultures\nin a direction which supports health and safety at work and in doing so also\npromotes a positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance\nproductivity of the undertakings...\u201d (ILO 1995b). This is known as developing\na \u201csafety culture.\u201d\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel01fe.gif)\n\nThe example of a safety performance management programme illustrates some\nhuman resource management theories in the context of occupational safety and\nhealth. As described by Reber, Wallin and Duhon (1993), this approach has had\nconsiderable success in reducing lost time on account of accidents. It relies\non specifying safe and unsafe behaviours, teaching employees how to recognize\nsafe behaviour and motivating them to follow the safety rules with goal\nsetting and feedback. The programme relies heavily on a training technique\nwhereby employees are shown safe, correct methods via videotapes or live\nmodels. They then have a chance to practice new behaviours and are provided\nwith frequent performance feedback. In addition, some companies offer tangible\nprizes and rewards for engaging in safe behaviour (rather than simply for\nhaving fewer accidents). Employee consultation is an important feature of the\nprogramme as well.\n\nThe implications of human resources management for industrial relations\npractices remain a source of some controversy. This is particularly the case\nfor types of workers\u2019 participation schemes that are perceived by trade unions\nas a threat. In some instances human resources management strategies are\npursued alongside collective bargaining; in other cases the human resources\nmanagement approach seeks to supplant or prevent the activities of independent\norganizations of workers in defence of their interests. Proponents of human\nresources management maintain that since the 1970s, the personnel management\nside of human resources management has evolved from being a maintenance\nfunction, secondary to the industrial relations function, to being one of\ncritical importance to the effectiveness of an organization (Ferris, Rosen and\nBarnum 1995). Since human resources management is a tool for management to\nemploy as part of its personnel policy rather than a relationship between an\nemployer and workers\u2019 chosen representatives, it is not the focus of this\nchapter.\n\nThe articles which follow describe the main parties in a labour relations\nsystem and the basic principles underpinning their interaction: rights to\nfreedom of association and representation. A natural corollary to freedom of\nassociation is the right to engage in collective bargaining, a phenomenon\nwhich must be distinguished from consultative and non-union worker\nparticipation arrangements. Collective bargaining takes place as negotiations\nbetween representatives chosen by the workers and those acting on behalf of\nthe employer; it leads to a mutually accepted, binding agreement that can\ncover a wide range of subjects.\n\nOther forms of workers\u2019 participation, national-level consultative bodies,\nworks councils and enterprise-level health and safety representatives are also\nimportant features of some labour relations systems and are thus examined in\nthis chapter. Consultation can take various forms and occur at different\nlevels, with national-, regional- and/or industrial- and enterprise-level\narrangements. Worker representatives in consultative bodies may or may not\nhave been selected by the workers and there is no obligation for the state or\nthe employer to follow the wishes of those representatives or to abide by the\nresults of the consultative process. In some countries, collective bargaining\nand consultative arrangements exist side by side and, to work properly, must\nbe carefully intermeshed. For both, rights to information about health and\nsafety and training are crucial. Finally, this chapter takes into account that\nin any labour relations system, disputes may arise, whether they are\nindividual or collective. Safety and health issues can lead to labour\nrelations strife, producing work stoppages. The chapter thus concludes with\ndescriptions of how labour relations disputes are resolved, including by\narbitration, mediation or resort to the regular or labour courts, preceded by\na discussion of the role of the labour inspectorate in the context of labour\nrelations.\n\n### The Actors in the Labour Relations System\n\nClassically, three actors have been identified as parties to the labour\nrelations system: the state, employers and workers\u2019 representatives. To this\npicture must now be added the forces that transcend these categories: regional\nand other multilateral economic integration arrangements among states and\nmultinational corporations as employers which do not have a national identity\nbut which also can be seen as labour market institutions. Since the impact of\nthese phenomena on labour relations remains unclear in many respects, however,\ndiscussion will focus on the more classic actors despite this caveat of the\nlimitation of such an analysis in an increasingly global community. In\naddition, greater emphasis is needed on analysing the role of the individual\nemployment relationship in labour relations systems and on the impact of the\nemerging alternative forms of work.\n\n### The State\n\nThe state always has at least an indirect effect on all labour relations. As\nthe source of legislation, the state exerts an inevitable influence on the\nemergence and development of a labour relations system. Laws can hinder or\nfoster, directly or indirectly, the establishment of organizations\nrepresenting workers and employers. Legislation also sets a minimum level of\nworker protection and lays down \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d. To take an example,\nit can provide lesser or greater protection for a worker who refuses to\nperform work he or she reasonably considers to be too hazardous, or for one\nwho acts as a health and safety representative.\n\nThrough the development of its labour administration, the state also has an\nimpact on how a labour relations system may function. If effective enforcement\nof the law is afforded through a labour inspectorate, collective bargaining\ncan pick up where the law leaves off. If, however, the state infrastructure\nfor having rights vindicated or for assisting in the resolution of disputes\nthat emerge between employers and workers is weak, they will be left more to\ntheir own devices to develop alternative institutions or arrangements.\n\nThe extent to which the state has built up a well-functioning court or other\ndispute resolution system may also have an influence on the course of labour\nrelations. The ease with which workers, employers and their respective\norganizations may enforce their legal rights can be as important as the rights\nthemselves. Thus the decision by a government to set up special tribunals or\nadministrative bodies to deal with labour disputes and/or disagreements over\nindividual employment problems can be an expression of the priority given to\nsuch issues in that society.\n\nIn many countries, the state has a direct role to play in labour relations. In\ncountries that do not respect freedom of association principles, this may\ninvolve outright control of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations or\ninterference with their activities. The state may attempt to invalidate\ncollective bargaining agreements that it perceives as interfering with its\neconomic policy goals. Generally speaking, however, the role of the state in\nindustrialized countries has tended to promote orderly industrial relations by\nproviding the necessary legislative framework, including minimum levels of\nworker protection and offering parties information, advice and dispute\nsettlement services. This could take the form of mere toleration of labour\nrelations institutions and the actors in them; it could move beyond to\nactively encourage such institutions. In a few countries, the state is a more\nactive participant in the industrial relations system, which includes national\nlevel tripartite negotiations. For decades in Belgium and more recently in\nIreland, for instance, government representatives have been sitting down\nalongside those from employer and trade union circles to hammer out a national\nlevel agreement or pact on a wide range of labour and social issues.\nTripartite machinery to fix minimum wages has long been a feature of labour\nrelations in Argentina and Mexico, for example. The interest of the state in\ndoing so derives from its desires to move the national economy in a certain\ndirection and to maintain social peace for the duration of the pact; such\nbipartite or tripartite arrangements create what has been called a \u201csocial\ndialogue\u201d, as it has developed in Australia (until 1994), Austria, Belgium,\nIreland and the Netherlands, for instance. The pros and cons of what have been\ntermed \u201ccorporatist\u201d or \u201cneocorporatist\u201d approaches to labour relations have\nbeen extensively debated over the years. With its tripartite structure, the\nInternational Labour Organization has long been a proponent of strong\ntripartite cooperation in which the \u201csocial partners\u201d play a significant role\nin shaping government policy on a wide range of issues.\n\nIn some countries, the very idea of the state becoming involved as a\nnegotiator in private sector bargaining is unthinkable, as in Germany or the\nUnited States. In such systems, the role of the state is, aside from its\nlegislative function, generally restricted to providing assistance to the\nparties in reaching an agreement, such as in offering voluntary mediation\nservices. Whether active or passive, however, the state is a constant partner\nin any labour relations system. In addition, where the state is itself the\nemployer, or an enterprise is publicly owned, it is of course directly\ninvolved in labour relations with the employees and their representatives. In\nthis context, the state is motivated by its role as provider of public\nservices and/or as an economic actor.\n\nFinally, the impact of regional economic integration arrangements on state\npolicy is also felt in the labour relations field. Within the European Union,\npractice in member countries has changed to reflect directives dealing with\nconsultation of workers and their representatives, including those on health\nand safety matters in particular. Multilateral trade agreements, such as the\nlabour side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Canada,\nMexico, United States) or the agreements implementing the Mercosur Common\nMarket (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, thought soon to be joined by\nBolivia and Chile) also sometimes contain workers\u2019 rights provisions or\nmechanisms that over time may have an indirect impact on labour relations\nsystems of the participating states.\n\n### Employers\n\nEmployers\u2013that is, providers of work\u2013are usually differentiated in industrial\nrelations systems depending upon whether they are in the private or the public\nsector. Historically, trade unionism and collective bargaining developed first\nin the private sector, but in recent years these phenomena have spread to many\npublic sector settings as well. The position of state-owned enterprises\u2014which\nin any event are dwindling in number around the world\u2014as employers, varies\ndepending upon the country. (They still play a key role in China, India, Viet\nNam and in many African countries.) In Eastern and Central Europe, one of the\nmajor challenges of the post-Communist era has been the establishment of\nindependent organizations of employers.\n\n#### International Employers\u2019 Organizations\n\nThe IOE\u2019s main activity, however, is to organize employers whenever they have\nto deal with social and labour matters at the global level. In practice, most\nof this takes place in the ILO, which has responsibility for these questions\nin the United Nations system. The IOE also has Category I consultative status\nwith the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, where it\nintervenes whenever matters of interest or consequence to employers arise.\n\nThe IOE is one of only two organizations that the employer community has set\nup to represent the interests of enterprise globally. The other is the\nInternational Chamber of Commerce, with its headquarters in Paris, which\nconcerns itself principally with economic matters. While structurally quite\ndifferent, the two organizations complement each other. They cooperate on the\nbasis of an agreement which defines their areas of responsibility as well as\nthrough good personal relations between their representatives and, to a\ndegree, on a common membership base. Many subjects cut across their mandates,\nof course, but are dealt with pragmatically without friction. On certain\nissues, such as multinational enterprises, the two organizations even act in\nunison.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from: ILO 1994)  \n  \n---  \n  \nIn the private sector, the situation has been summed up as follows:\n\nEmployers have common interests to defend and precise causes to advance. In\norganizing themselves, they pursue several aims which in turn determine the\ncharacter of their organizations. These can be chambers of commerce, economic\nfederations and employers\u2019 organizations (for social and labour matters) ...\nWhere issues centre essentially on social matters and industrial relations,\nincluding collective bargaining, occupational health and safety, human\nresource development, labour law and wages, the desire for co-ordinated action\nhas led to the creation of employers\u2019 organizations, which are always\nvoluntary in nature ... (ILO 1994a).\n\nSome employers\u2019 organizations were initially established in response to\npressure from the trade unions to negotiate, but others may be traced to\nmedieval guilds or other groups founded to defend particular market interests.\nEmployers\u2019 organizations have been described as formal groups of employers set\nup to defend, represent and advise affiliated employers and to strengthen\ntheir position in society at large with respect to labour matters as distinct\nfrom economic matters ... Unlike trade unions, which are composed of\nindividual persons, employers\u2019 organizations are composed of enterprises\n(Oechslin 1995).\n\nAs identified by Oechslin, there tend to be three main functions (to some\nextent overlapping) common to all employers\u2019 organizations: defence and\npromotion of their members\u2019 interests, representation in the political\nstructure and provision of services to their members. The first function is\nreflected largely in lobbying government to adopt policies that are friendly\nto employers\u2019 interests and in influencing public opinion, chiefly through\nmedia campaigns. The representative function may occur in the political\nstructure or in industrial relations institutions. Political representation is\nfound in systems where consultation of interested economic groups is foreseen\nby law (e.g., Switzerland), where economic and social councils provide for\nemployer representation (e.g., France, French-speaking African countries and\nthe Netherlands) and where there is participation in tripartite forums such as\nthe International Labour Conference and other aspects of ILO activity. In\naddition, employers\u2019 organizations can exercise considerable influence at the\nregional level (especially within the European Union).\n\nThe way in which the representative function in the industrial relations\nsystem occurs depends very much on the level at which collective bargaining\ntakes place in a particular country. This factor also largely determines the\nstructure of an employers\u2019 organization. If bargaining is centralized at the\nnational level, the employers\u2019 organization will reflect that in its internal\nstructure and operations (central economic and statistical data bank, creation\nof a mutual strike insurance system, strong sense of member discipline, etc.).\nEven in countries where bargaining takes place at the enterprise level (such\nas Japan or the United States), the employers\u2019 organization can offer its\nmembers information, guidelines and advice. Bargaining that takes place at the\nindustrial level (as in Germany, where, however, some employers have recently\nbroken ranks with their associations) or at multiple levels (as in France or\nItaly) of course also influences the structure of employers\u2019 organizations.\n\nAs for the third function, Oechslin notes, \u201cit is not always easy to draw a\nline between activities supporting the functions described above and those\nundertaken for the members in their interest\u201d (p. 42). Research is the prime\nexample, since it can be used for multiple purposes. Safety and health is an\narea in which data and information can be usefully shared by employers across\nsectors. Often, new concepts or reactions to novel developments in the world\nof work have been the product of broad reflection within employers\u2019\norganizations. These groups also provide training to members on a wide range\nof management issues and have undertaken social affairs action, such as in the\ndevelopment of workers\u2019 housing or support for community activities. In some\ncountries, employers\u2019 organizations provide assistance to their members in\nlabour court cases.\n\nThe structure of employers\u2019 organizations will depend not only on the level at\nwhich bargaining is done, but also on the country\u2019s size, political system and\nsometimes religious traditions. In developing countries, the main challenge\nhas been the integration of a very heterogeneous membership that may include\nsmall and medium-sized businesses, state enterprises and subsidiaries of\nmultinational corporations. The strength of an employers\u2019 organi-zation is\nreflected in the resources its members are willing to devote to it, whether in\nthe form of dues and contributions or in terms of their expertise and time.\n\nThe size of an enterprise is a major determinant in its approach to labour\nrelations, with the employer of a small workforce being more likely to rely on\ninformal means for dealing with its workers. Small and medium-sized\nenterprises, which are variously defined, sometimes fall under the threshold\nfor legally mandated workers\u2019 participation schemes. Where collective\nbargaining occurs at the enterprise level, it is much more likely to exist in\nlarge firms; where it takes place at the industry or national level, it is\nmore likely to have an effect in areas where large firms have historically\ndominated the private sector market.\n\nAs interest organizations, employers\u2019 organizations\u2014like trade unions\u2014have\ntheir own problems in the areas of leadership, internal decision-making and\nmember participation. Since employers tend to be individualists, however, the\nchallenge of marshalling discipline among the membership is even greater for\nemployers\u2019 organizations. As van Waarden notes (1995), \u201cemployers\u2019\nassociations generally have high density ratios ... However, employers find it\na much greater sacrifice to comply with the decisions and regulations of their\nassociations, as these reduce their much cherished freedom of enterprise.\u201d\nTrends in the structure of employers\u2019 organizations very much reflect those of\nthe labour market\u2013 towards or against centralization, in favour of or opposed\nto regulation of competition. Van Waarden continues: \u201ceven if the pressure to\nbecome more flexible in the \u2018post-Fordist\u2019 era continues, it does not\nnecessarily make employers\u2019 associations redundant or less influential ...\n(They) would still play an important role, namely as a forum for the\ncoordination of labour market policies behind the scenes and as an advisor for\nfirms or branch associations engaged in collective bargaining\u201d (ibid., p.\n104). They can also perform a solidarity function; through employers\u2019\nassociations, small employers may have access to legal or advisory services\nthey otherwise could not afford.\n\nPublic employers have come to see themselves as such only relatively recently.\nInitially, the government took the position that a worker\u2019s involvement in\ntrade union activity was incompatible with service to the sovereign state.\nThey later resisted calls to engage in collective bargaining with the argument\nthat the legislature, not the public administration, was the paymaster and\nthat it was thus impossible for the administration to enter into an agreement.\nThese arguments, however, did not prevent (often unlawful) public sector\nstrikes in many countries and they have fallen by the wayside. In 1978, the\nInternational Labour Conference adopted the Labour Relations (Public Service)\nConvention (No. 151) and Recommendation (No. 159) on public employees\u2019 right\nto organize and on procedures for determining their terms and conditions of\nemployment. Collective bargaining in the public sector is now a way of life in\nmany developed countries (e.g., Australia, France, United Kingdom) as well as\nin some developing countries (e.g., many francophone African countries and\nmany countries in Latin America).\n\nThe level of employer representation in the public sector depends largely upon\nthe political system of the country. In some this is a centralized function\n(as in France) whereas in others it reflects the various divisions of\ngovernment (as in the United States, where bargaining can take place at the\nfederal, state and municipal levels). Germany presents an interesting case in\nwhich the thousands of local communities have banded together to have a single\nbargaining agent deal with the unions in the public sector throughout the\ncountry.\n\nBecause public sector employers are already part of the state, they do not\nfall under laws requiring registration of employers\u2019 organizations. The\ndesignation of the bargaining agent in the public sector varies considerably\nby country; it may be the Public Service Commission, the Ministry of Labour,\nthe Ministry of Finance or another entity altogether. The positions taken by a\npublic employer in dealing with employees in this sector tend to follow the\npolitical orientation of the ruling political party. This may range from\ntaking a particular stance in bargaining to a flat-out denial of the right of\npublic employees to organize into trade unions. However, while as an employer\nthe public service is shrinking in many countries, there is an increasing\nreadiness on its part to engage in bargaining and consultations with employee\nrepresentatives.\n\n### Trade Unions\n\nThe classic definition of a trade union is \u201ca continuous association of wage\nearners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their\nemployment\u201d (Webb and Webb 1920). The origins of trade unions go back as far\nas the first attempts to organize collective action at the beginning of the\nindustrial revolution. In the modern sense, however, trade unions arose in the\nlater part of the nineteenth century, when governments first began to concede\nthe unions\u2019 legal right to exist (previously, they had been seen as illegal\ncombinations interfering with freedom of commerce, or as outlawed political\ngroups). Trade unions reflect the conviction that only by banding together can\nworkers improve their situation. Trade union rights were born out of economic\nand political struggle which saw short-term individual sacrifice in the cause\nof longer-term collective gain. They have often played an important role in\nnational politics and have influenced developments in the world of work at the\nregional and international levels. Having suffered membership losses, however,\nin recent years in a number of countries (in North America and some parts of\nEurope), their role is under challenge in many quarters (see figure 21.2). The\npattern is mixed with areas of membership growth in the public service in many\ncountries around the world and with a new lease on life in places where trade\nunions were previously non-existent or active only under severe restrictions\n(e.g., Korea, the Philippines, some countries of Central and Eastern Europe).\nThe flourishing of democratic institutions goes hand in hand with the exercise\nof trade union freedoms, as the cases of Chile and Poland in the 1980s and\n1990s best illustrate. A process of internal reform and reorientation to\nattract greater and more diverse membership, particularly more women, can also\nbe seen within trade union circles in a number of countries. Only time will\ntell if these and other factors will be sufficient to deflect the\ncounterweighing tendencies towards the \u201cde-collectivization\u201d, also referred to\nas \u201catomization\u201d, of labour relations that has accompanied increased economic\nglobalization and ideological individualism.\n\n#### Figure 21.2 Membership rates in trade unions, 1980-1990\n\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel02fe.gif)\n\nIn contemporary industrial relations systems, the functions fulfilled by trade\nunions are, like employers\u2019 organizations, basically the following: defence\nand promotion of the members\u2019 interests; political representation; and\nprovision of services to members. The flip side of trade unions\u2019\nrepresentative function is their control function: their legitimacy depends in\npart upon the ability to exert discipline over the membership, as for example\nin calling or ending a strike. The trade unions\u2019 constant challenge is to\nincrease their density, that is, the number of members as a percentage of the\nformal sector workforce. The members of trade unions are individuals; their\ndues, called contributions in some systems, support the union\u2019s activities.\n(Trade unions financed by employers, called \u201ccompany unions\u201d, or by\ngovernments as in formerly Communist countries, are not considered here, since\nonly independent organizations of workers are true trade unions.) Affiliation\nis generally a matter of an individual\u2019s voluntary decision, although some\nunions that have been able to win closed shop or union security arrangements\nare considered to be the representatives of all workers covered by a\nparticular collective bargaining agreement (i.e., in countries where trade\nunions are recognized as representatives of workers in a circumscribed\nbargaining unit). Trade unions may be affiliated to umbrella organizations at\nthe industrial, national, regional and international levels.\n\n#### International Labour Federations\n\nThe international labour movement on a global, as opposed to a regional or\nnational level, consists of international associations of national federations\nof labour unions. There are currently three such internationals, reflecting\ndifferent ideological tendencies: the International Confederation of Free\nTrade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the\nrelatively small, originally Christian, World Congress of Labour (WCL). The\nICFTU is the largest, with 174 affiliated unions from 124 countries in 1995,\nrepresenting 116 million trade union members. These groups lobby\nintergovernmental organizations on overall economic and social policy and\npress for worldwide protection of basic trade union rights. They can be\nthought of as the political force behind the international labour movement.\n\nThe industrial force of the international labour movement lies in the\ninternational associations of specific labour unions, usually drawn from one\ntrade, industry or economic sector. Known as International Trade Secretariats\n(ITSs) or Trade Union Internationals (TUIs), they may be independent,\naffiliated to, or controlled by the internationals. Coverage has traditionally\nbeen by sector, but also in some cases is by employee category (such as white-\ncollar workers), or by employer (public or private). For example, in 1995\nthere were 13 operative ITSs aligned with the ICFTU, distributed as follows:\nbuilding and woodworking; chemical and mining, energy; commercial, clerical,\nprofessional and technical; education; entertainment; food, agriculture,\nrestaurant and catering; graphic arts; journalism; metalworking; postal and\ntelecommunications; public service; textile, garment and leather work;\ntransport. The ITSs concentrate mainly on industry-specific issues, such as\nindustrial disputes and pay rates, but also the application of health and\nsafety provisions in a specific sector. They provide information, education,\ntraining and other services to affiliated unions. They also help coordinate\ninternational solidarity between unions in different countries, and represent\nthe interests of workers in various international and regional forums.\n\nSuch action is illustrated by the international trade union response to the\nincident at Bhopal, India, involving the leak of methyl isocyanate, which\nclaimed thousands of victims on 3 December 1984. At the request of their\nIndian national trade union affiliates, the ICFTU and the International\nFederation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers\u2019 Unions (ICEM) sent a\nmission to Bhopal to study the causes and effects of the gas leak. The report\ncontained recommendations for preventing similar disasters and endorsed a list\nof safety principles; this report has been used by trade unionists in both\nindustrialized and developing countries as a basis of programmes for improving\nhealth and safety at work.\n\nSource: Rice 1995.  \n  \n---  \n  \nTrade unions are structured along various lines: by craft or occupation, by\nbranch of industry, by whether they group white- or blue-collar workers and\nsometimes even by enterprise. There are also general unions, which include\nworkers from various occupations and industries. Even in countries where\nmergers of industrial unions and general unions are the trend, the situation\nof agricultural or rural workers has often favoured the development of special\nstructures for that sector. On top of this breakdown there is often a\nterritorial division, with regional and sometimes local subunits, within a\nunion. In some countries there have been splits in the labour movement around\nideological (party politics) and even religious lines which then come to be\nreflected in trade union structure and membership. Public sector employees\ntend to be represented by unions separate from those representing employees in\nthe private sector, although there are exceptions to this as well.\n\nThe legal status of a trade union may be that of any other association, or it\nmay be subject to special rules. A great number of countries require trade\nunions to register and to divulge certain basic information to the authorities\n(name, address, identity of officials, etc.). In some countries this goes\nbeyond mere record-keeping to interference; in extreme cases of disregard for\nfreedom of association principles, trade unions will need government\nauthorization to operate. As representatives of workers, trade unions are\nempowered to enter into engagements on their behalf. Some countries (such as\nthe United States) require employer recognition of trade unions as an initial\nprerequisite to engaging in collective bargaining.\n\nTrade union density varies widely between and within countries. In some\ncountries in Western Europe, for instance, it is very high in the public\nsector but tends to be low in the private sector and especially in its white-\ncollar employment. The figures for blue-collar employment in that region are\nmixed, from a high in Austria and Sweden to a low in France, where, however,\ntrade union political power far exceeds what membership figures would suggest.\nThere is some positive correlation between centralization of bargaining and\ntrade union density, but exceptions to this also exist.\n\nAs voluntary associations, trade unions draw up their own rules, usually in\nthe form of a constitution and by-laws. In democratic trade union structures,\nmembers select trade union officers either by direct vote or through delegates\nto a general conference. Internal union government in a small, highly\ndecentralized union of workers in a particular occupational group is likely to\ndiffer significantly from that found in a large, centralized general or\nindustrial union. There are tasks to allocate among union officers, between\npaid and unpaid union representatives and coordination work to be done. The\nfinancial resources available to a union will also vary depending upon its\nsize and the ease with which it can collect dues. Institution of a dues check-\noff system (whereby dues are deducted from a worker\u2019s wages and paid directly\nto the union) alleviates this task greatly. In most of Central and Eastern\nEurope, trade unions that were dominated and funded by the state are being\ntransformed and/or joined by new independent organizations; all are struggling\nto find a place and operate successfully in the new economic structure.\nExtremely low wages (and thus dues) there and in developing countries with\ngovernment-supported unions make it difficult to build a strong independent\nunion movement.\n\nIn addition to the important function of collective bargaining, one of the\nmain activities of trade unions in many countries is their political work.\nThis may take the form of direct representation, with trade unions being given\nreserved seats in some parliaments (e.g., Senegal) and on tripartite bodies\nthat have a role in determining national economic and social policy (e.g.,\nAustria, France, the Netherlands), or on tripartite advisory bodies in the\nfields of labour and social affairs (e.g., in many Latin American and some\nAfrican and Asian countries). In the European Union, trade union federations\nhave had an important impact on the development of social policy. More\ntypically, trade unions have an influence through the exercise of power\n(backed up by a threat of industrial action) and lobbying political decision\nmakers at the national level. It is certainly true that trade unions have\nsuccessfully fought for greater legislative protection for all workers around\nthe world; some believe that this has been a bittersweet victory, in the long\nrun undermining their own justification to exist. The objectives and issues of\nunion political action have often extended well beyond narrower interests; a\nprime example of this was the struggle against apartheid within South Africa\nand the international solidarity expressed by unions around the world in words\nand in deeds (e.g., organizing dockworker boycotts of imported South African\ncoal). Whether trade union political activity is on the offence or the defence\nwill of course depend largely on whether the government in power tends to be\npro- or anti-labour. It will also depend upon the union\u2019s relationship to\npolitical parties; some unions, particularly in Africa, were part of their\ncountries\u2019 struggles for independence and maintain very close ties with ruling\npolitical parties. In other countries there is a traditional interdependence\nbetween the labour movement and a political party (e.g., Australia, United\nKingdom), whereas in others alliances may shift over time. In any event, the\npower of trade unions often exceeds what would be expected from their\nnumerical strength, particularly where they represent workers in a key\neconomic or public service sector, such as transport or mining.\n\nAside from trade unions, many other types of workers\u2019 participation have\nsprung up to provide indirect or direct representation of employees. In some\ninstances they exist alongside trade unions; in others they are the only type\nof participation available to workers. The functions and powers of workers\u2019\nrepresentatives that exist under such arrangements are described in the\narticle \u201cForms of workers\u2019 participation\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe third type of function of trade unions, providing services to members,\nfocuses first and foremost on the workplace. A shop steward at the enterprise\nlevel is there to ensure that workers\u2019 rights under the collective bargaining\nagreement and the law are being respected\u2013and, if not, to take action. The\nunion officer\u2019s job is to defend the interests of workers vis-\u00e0-vis\nmanagement, thereby legitimizing his or her own representative role. This may\ninvolve taking up an individual grievance over discipline or dismissal, or\ncooperating with management on a joint health and safety committee. Outside\nthe workplace, many unions provide other types of benefit, such as\npreferential access to credit and participation in welfare schemes. The union\nhall can also serve as a centre for cultural events or even large family\nceremonies. The range of services a union can offer to its members is vast and\nreflects the creativity and resources of the union itself as well as the\ncultural milieu in which it operates.\n\nAs Visser observes:\n\nThe power of trade unions depends on various internal and external factors. We\ncan distinguish between organizational power (how many internal sources of\npower can unions mobilize?), institutional power (which external sources of\nsupport can unions depend on?) and economic power (which market forces play\ninto the hands of unions?) (Visser in van Ruysseveldt et al. 1995).\n\nAmong the factors he identifies for a strong trade union structure are the\nmobilization of a large, stable, dues-paying and well-trained membership (to\nthis could be added a membership that reflects the composition of the labour\nmarket), avoidance of organizational fragmentation and political or\nideological rifts and development of an organizational structure that provides\na presence at the company level while having central control of funds and\ndecision making. Whether such a model for success, which to date has been\nnational in character, can evolve in the face of an increasingly\ninternationalized economy, is the great challenge facing trade unions at this\njuncture.\n\n## RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION AND REPRESENTATION\n\nBreen Creighton\n\n### Relationship between Rights of Association and Representation and\nOccupational Safety and Health\n\nJoint consultation and participation can be effective only in an environment\nwhere there is adequate recognition of and respect for the right of employers\nand workers to associate freely and for their organizations to be able to\nrepresent their interests effectively. In a very real sense, therefore,\nrespect for the right to organize can be seen to be an essential precondition\nof an effective occupational safety and health strategy at both the national\nand international level and at the workplace. That being the case, it is\nnecessary and appropriate to look more closely at ILO standards relating to\nfreedom of association, bearing in mind their application in the context of\nthe prevention of work-related injury and disease and the compensation and\nrehabilitation of those who have incurred such injury or disease. Freedom of\nassociation standards require that there be proper recognition in law and\npractice of the right of workers and employers to form and to join the\norganizations of their choice and of the right of those organizations, once\nestablished, to formulate and to implement freely their programmes.\n\nRights of association and representation also underpin tripartite\n(governments, employers and workers) cooperation in the field of occupational\nhealth and safety. Such cooperation is promoted in the context of ILO\nstandard-setting, for example, by:\n\n\u00b7 enjoining governments to consult with representative organizations of\nemployers and workers in relation to the formulation and implementation of\npolicy on occupational health and safety at the national or regional level\n(e.g., Asbestos Convention, 1986 (No. 162), Article 4 and Occupational Safety\nand Health Convention, 1981 (No. 155), Articles 1 and 8)\n\n\u00b7 encouraging joint consultation and cooperation on occupational safety and\nhealth matters at the level of the workplace (e.g., Prevention of Major\nIndustrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174), Article 9(f) and (g))\n\n\u00b7 requiring the joint participation of employers and workers in the\nformulation and implementation of occupational safety and health policy in the\nworkplace (see especially Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No.\n155), Articles 19 and 20 and Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation,\n1981 (No. 164), para 12).\n\n### ILO and Rights of Association and Representation\n\nThe \u201cright of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as\nby the employers\u201d was one of the methods and principles set out in Article 41\nof the original Constitution of the ILO. This principle now finds express\nrecognition in the Preamble to the Constitution as one of the essential\npreconditions of the establishment of social justice, which is itself seen as\nthe essential precondition of universal and lasting peace. Together with the\nprinciple of tripartism, it is also accorded express recognition in Article I\nof the Declaration of Philadelphia, which was appended to the Constitution in\n1946. This Constitutional endorsement of the importance of respect for the\nprinciples of freedom of association helps provide one of the juridical bases\nfor the capacity of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of\nAssociation and the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association to\ninquire into alleged breaches of the principles of freedom of association.\n\nAs early as 1921 the International Labour Conference adopted the Right of\nAssociation (Agriculture) Convention (No. 11), which requires ratifying States\nto \u201csecure to all those engaged in agriculture the same rights of association\nand combination as to industrial workers\u201d. It does not, however, say anything\nabout the rights which are to be accorded to the industrial workers with whom\nthose engaged in agriculture are to enjoy parity! Attempts to adopt a more\ngeneral instrument dealing with freedom of association in the 1920s foundered\nupon the rocks of employer and government insistence that the right to form\nand join trade unions must be accompanied by a correlative right not to join.\nThe matter was re-opened in the period immediately after the Second World War.\nThis duly resulted in the adoption of the Right of Association (Non-\nMetropolitan Territories) Convention, 1947 (No. 84), the Freedom of\nAssociation and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)\nand the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are among the most important and the most widely\nratified of all ILO Conventions: as of 31 December 1996, Convention No. 87 had\nattracted 119 ratifications, while No. 98 had attracted 133. Between them they\nembody what can properly be regarded as the four key elements in the notion of\nfreedom of association. They are regarded as the benchmark for the\ninternational protection of freedom of association for trade union purposes,\nas reflected, for example, in Article 8 of the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article 22 of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Within the ILO structure, they form\nthe basis for the principles of freedom of association as developed and\napplied by the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association and the\nFact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, even\nthough in technical terms those bodies derive their jurisdiction from the\nConstitution of the Organization rather than the Conventions. They also\nconstitute a major focus for the deliberations of the Committee of Experts on\nthe Application of Conventions and Recommendations and of the Conference\nCommittee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n\nDespite the pivotal role of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, it should be\nappreciated that they are by no means the only formal standard-setting\ninstruments which have been adopted under the auspices of the ILO in the field\nof freedom of association. On the contrary, since 1970 the Conference has\nadopted further four Conventions and four Recommendations dealing in greater\ndetail with various aspects of the principles of freedom of association, or\nwith their application in certain specific contexts:\n\n\u00b7 the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135) and Recommendation (No.\n143), 1971\n\n\u00b7 the Rural Workers\u2019 Organizations Convention (No. 141) and Recommendation\n(No. 149), 1975\n\n\u00b7 the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention (No. 151) and\nRecommendation (No. 158), 1978\n\n\u00b7 the Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 154) and Recommendation (No. 163),\n1981\n\n### Principles of Freedom of Association\n\n#### The core elements\n\nThe core elements of the principles of freedom of association as embodied in\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are:\n\n\u00b7 that \u201cworkers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the\nright to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization\nconcerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without previous\nauthorization\u201d (Article 2 of Convention No. 87)\n\n\u00b7 that organizations of employers and workers, once established, should have\nthe right \u201cto draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their\nrepresentatives in full freedom, to organize their administration and\nactivities and to formulate their programmes\u201d (Article 3(1) of Convention No.\n87). Furthermore, the public authorities must \u201crefrain from any interference\nwhich would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof\u201d\n(Article 3(2))\n\n\u00b7 that workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination in respect of their employment\u201d (Article 1(1) of Convention No.\n98)\n\n\u00b7 that \u201cmeasures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where\nnecessary, to encourage and to promote the full development and utilization of\nmachinery for voluntary negotiation between employers and employers\u2019\norganizations and workers\u2019 organizations, with a view to the regulation of\nterms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements\u201d (Article\n4 of Convention No. 98)\n\nAll of the guarantees provided by Convention No. 87 are subject to the proviso\nset out in Article 8(1): \u201cin exercising the rights provided for in this\nConvention workers and employers and their respective organizations... shall\nrespect the law of the land\u201d. This in turn is subject to the further proviso\nthat the \u201claw of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be\napplied so as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that by virtue of Article 9(1) of Convention No. 87 it\nis permissible, but not necessary, to qualify the application of the\nguarantees set out in that Convention to members of the police and of the\narmed forces. Article 5(1) of Convention No. 98 is to the same effect, while\nArticle 6 of that instrument stipulates that the Convention \u201cdoes not deal\nwith the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the\nState, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their rights or status in any\nway.\u201d\n\n#### The right to join\n\nThe right of workers and employers to form and to join the organizations of\ntheir choice is the pivot of all of the other guarantees provided by\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 and by the principles of freedom of association. It\nis subject only to the qualification set out in Article 9(1) of the\nConvention. This means that it is not permissible to deny any group of workers\nother than members of the police or the armed forces the right to form or join\nthe trade unions of their choice. It follows that denial or restriction of the\nright of public servants, agricultural workers, school teachers and so on to\nform or join the organizations of their choice would not be consistent with\nthe requirements of Article 2.\n\nIt is, however, permissible for the rules of a trade union or an employer\norganization to restrict the categories of workers or employers who may join\nthe organization. The point is that any such restriction must be the result of\nthe free choice of the members of the organization \u2013 it must not be imposed\nfrom outside.\n\nThe right to associate set out in Article 2 is not accompanied by any\ncorrelative right not to associate. It will be recalled that earlier attempts\nto adopt a general freedom of association convention failed because of the\ninsistence by employer and some government delegates that the positive right\nto associate must carry with it a negative right not to associate. This issue\nwas again raised in the context of the debates on Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\nHowever on this occasion a compromise was effected whereby the Conference\nadopted a resolution to the effect that the extent to which trade union\nsecurity devices (such as the \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d shop and check-off\narrangements for trade union dues) were permissible or otherwise was a matter\nto be determined by national law and practice. In other words, the Conventions\nare considered neither to condone nor to condemn the closed shop and other\nforms of union security device, although such measures are not regarded as\nacceptable if they are imposed by law rather than adopted by agreement of the\nparties (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a).\n\nPerhaps the most difficult issue which has arisen in the context of Article 2\nrelates to the extent to which it can be said to endorse the notion of trade\nunion pluralism. In other words, is it consistent with Article 2 for the law\nto limit, directly or indirectly, the right of workers (or employers) to form\nor join the organization of their choice through the application of\nadministrative or legislative criteria?\n\nThere are two sets of competing interests in this context. On the one hand,\nArticle 2 is clearly meant to protect the right of workers and employers to\nchoose the organization to which they wish to belong and to choose not to\nbelong to organizations with which they are out of sympathy on political,\ndenominational or other grounds. On the other hand, governments (and indeed\ntrade unions) may argue that the excessive proliferation of trade unions and\nemployer organizations which may be an incident of unrestricted freedom of\nchoice is not conducive to the development of free and effective organizations\nor the establishment and maintenance of orderly industrial relations\nprocesses. This was an issue of particular difficulty in the Cold War era,\nwhen governments often sought to restrict the range of unions to which workers\ncould belong on ideological grounds. It remains a highly sensitive issue in\nmany developing countries where governments, for good reason or ill, wish to\nprevent what they see as the excessive proliferation of trade unions by\nplacing restrictions on the number and/or size of unions which can operate in\na given workplace or sector of the economy. The ILO\u2019s supervisory bodies have\ntended to adopt a fairly restrictive approach to this issue, permitting trade\nunion monopolies where they are the result of the free choice of the workers\nin the country concerned and permitting the adoption of \u201creasonable\u201d\nregistration criteria, but taking exception to legally imposed monopolies and\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d registration criteria. In doing so, they have attracted\nconsiderable criticism, especially from governments in developing countries\nwhich accuse them of adopting a Eurocentric approach to the application of the\nConvention \u2013 the point being that the characteristically European concern with\nthe rights of the individual is said to be inconsistent with the collectivist\ntraditions of many non-European cultures.\n\n#### Organizational autonomy and the right to strike\n\nIf Article 2 of Convention No. 87 protects the fundamental right of employers\nand workers to form and to join the organization of their choice, then Article\n3 can be seen to provide its logical corollary by protecting the\norganizational autonomy of organizations once established.\n\nAs the wording of Article 3(1) clearly indicates, this would include the\ndrafting, adoption and implementation of the constitutions and rules of\norganizations and the conduct of elections. However, the supervisory bodies\nhave accepted that it is permissible for the public authorities to impose\nminimum conditions upon the content or administration of rules for the purpose\nof \u201censuring a sound administration and preventing legal complications arising\nas a result of constitutions and rules being drawn up in insufficient detail\u201d\n(ILO 1994b). However, if such conditions are excessively detailed or onerous\nin application then they are likely to be adjudged to be inconsistent with the\nrequirements of Article 3.\n\nOver the years the supervisory bodies have consistently taken the view that\n\u201cthe right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right to organize\nprotected by Convention No. 87\u201d (ILO 1994b):\n\nThe Committee (of Experts) considers that the right to strike is one of the\nessential means available to workers and their organizations for the\nprotection of their economic and social interests. These interests not only\nhave to do with obtaining better working conditions and pursuing collective\ndemands of an occupational nature, but also with seeking solutions to economic\nand social policy questions and to labour problems of any kind which are of\ndirect concern to the workers.\n\nThis is one of the most controversial aspects of the entire jurisprudence\nrelating to freedom of association and in recent years in particular it has\ncome in for vigorous criticism from employer and government members of the\nConference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n(See, for example, International Labour Conference, 80th Session (1993),\nRecord of Proceedings, 25/10-12 and 25/58-64 and International Labour\nConference, 81st Session (1994), Record of Proceedings, 25/92-94 and\n25/179-180.) It is, however, a firmly entrenched feature of the jurisprudence\non freedom of association. It finds clear recognition in Article 8(1) (d) of\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and was\nendorsed by the Committee of Experts in its 1994 General Survey on Freedom of\nAssociation and Collective Bargaining (ILO 1994b).\n\nIt is important to appreciate, however, that the right to strike as recognized\nby the supervisory bodies is not an unqualified one. In the first place, it\ndoes not extend to those groups of workers in relation to whom it is\npermissible to attenuate the guarantees set out in Convention No. 87, namely\nmembers of the police and armed forces. Furthermore, it has also been\ndetermined that the right to strike may legitimately be denied to \u201cpublic\nservants acting as agents of the public authority\u201d and to workers engaged in\nessential services in the sense of \u201cservices whose interruption would endanger\nthe life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.\u201d\nHowever, any restrictions upon the right to strike of workers in these latter\ncategories must be offset by compensatory guarantees, such as \u201cconciliation\nand mediation procedures leading, in the event of a deadlock, to arbitration\nmachinery seen to be reliable by the parties concerned. It is essential that\nthe latter be able to participate in determining and implementing the\nprocedure, which should furthermore provide sufficient guarantees of\nimpartiality and rapidity: arbitration awards should be binding on both\nparties and once issued should be implemented rapidly and completely\u201d (ILO\n1994b).\n\nIt is also permissible to impose temporary restrictions upon the right to\nstrike in times of \u201cacute national emergency\u201d. More generally, it is\npermissible to impose preconditions such as balloting requirements, exhaustion\nof conciliation procedures and so on, upon the exercise of the right to\nstrike. However, all such restrictions must \u201cbe reasonable and... not such as\nto place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union\norganizations\u201d.\n\nThe right to strike is often described as the weapon of last resort in\ncollective bargaining. If Article 3 is interpreted so as to protect the weapon\nof last resort, it seems reasonable to suppose that it must also protect the\nprocess of collective bargaining itself. The supervisory bodies have indeed\ntaken this view on a number of occasions, but in general they have preferred\nto base their jurisprudence on collective bargaining upon Article 4 of\nConvention No. 98. (For more detailed discussion of the ILO jurisprudence on\nthe right to strike, see Hodges-Aeberhard and Odero de Dios 1987; Ben-Israel\n1988).\n\nThe autonomy of organizations of employers and workers is also addressed in\nArticles 4 to 7 of Convention No. 87 and in Article 2 of Convention No. 98.\nArticle 4 provides that such organizations must not be \u201cliable to be dissolved\nor suspended by administrative authority\u201d. This does not mean that trade\nunions or employers\u2019 organizations cannot be deregistered or dissolved where\nthey have, for example, engaged in gross industrial misconduct or have not\nbeen run in accordance with their rules. But it does mean that any such\nsanction must be imposed through a duly constituted court or other appropriate\nbody, rather than by administrative diktat.\n\nArticle 5 protects the rights of organizations to form and join federations\nand confederations and also the right of organizations, federations and\nconfederations to affiliate with international organizations of employers and\nworkers. Furthermore, according to Article 6, the guarantees set out in\nArticles 2, 3 and 4 apply to federations and confederations in the same way as\nto first level organizations, while Article 7 stipulates that the acquisition\nof legal personality by organizations of employers or workers must not be made\nsubject to \u201cconditions of such a character as to restrict the application of\nthe provisions of Articles 2, 3 and 4.\u201d\n\nFinally, Article 2(1) of Convention No. 98 requires that organizations of\nemployers and workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of\ninterference by each other or each other\u2019s agents or members in their\nestablishment, functioning or administration\u201d. In practical terms, it seems\nsomewhat unlikely that trade unions would or could effectively interfere with\nthe internal functioning of employer organizations. It is quite conceivable,\nhowever, that in certain circumstances employers or their organizations would\nseek to interfere with the internal affairs of workers\u2019 organizations \u2013 for\nexample, by providing some or all of their funds. This possibility finds\nexpress recognition in Article 2(2):\n\nIn particular, acts which are designed to promote the establishment of\nworkers\u2019 organizations under the domination of employers or employers\u2019\norganizations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such\norganizations under the control of employers or employers\u2019 organizations,\nshall be deemed to constitute acts of interference within the meaning of this\nArticle.\n\n#### Protection against victimization\n\nFor the guarantees set out in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 to be meaningful in\npractice, it is clearly necessary that individuals who exercise their right to\nform or join organizations of workers be protected against victimization on\naccount of having done so. This logic finds recognition in Article 1(1) of\nConvention No. 98, which, as indicated, requires that \u201cworkers shall enjoy\nadequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of\ntheir employment.\u201d Article 1(2) takes the matter further:\n\nSuch protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated\nto:\n\n(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not\njoin a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;\n\n(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union\nmembership or because of participation in union activities outside working\nhours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.\n\nAnti-union discrimination for these purposes would include refusal to employ,\ndismissal and other measures such as \u201ctransfer, relocation, demotion,\ndeprivation or restrictions of all kinds (remuneration, social benefits,\nvocational training)\u201d which may cause serious prejudice to the worker\nconcerned (see also Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158),\nArticle 5(a), (b) and (c), as well as ILO 1994b, para.212).\n\nNot only must there be comprehensive protection against anti-union\ndiscrimination as defined, but by virtue of Article 3 of Convention No. 98,\nthere must also be effective means of enforcing those protections:\n\nLegal standards are inadequate if they are not coupled with effective and\nexpeditious procedures and with sufficiently dissuasive penal sanctions to\nensure their application ... The onus placed on the employer to prove the\nalleged anti-union discriminatory measures are connected with questions other\nthan trade union matters, or presumptions established in the worker\u2019s favour\nare additional means of ensuring effective protection of the right to organize\nguaranteed by the Convention. Legislation which allows the employer in\npractice to terminate the employment of a worker on condition that he pay the\ncompensation provided for by law in any case of unjustified dismissal... is\ninadequate under the terms of Article 1 of the Convention. Legislation should\nalso provide effective means for implementing means of compensation, with the\nreinstatement of the dismissed worker, including retroactive compensation,\nbeing the most appropriate remedy in such cases of anti-union discrimination\n(ILO 1994b).\n\n#### Collective bargaining\n\nThe guarantee set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 has been interpreted\nso as to protect both the right to engage in collective bargaining and the\nautonomy of the bargaining process. In other words it is not consistent with\nArticle 4 for employers and workers to be denied the right to engage in\ncollective bargaining if they wish to do so\u2014bearing in mind that it is not\ninconsistent with the Convention to deny these rights to members of the police\nor the armed forces and that \u201cthe Convention does not deal with the position\nof public servants engaged in the administration of the State\u201d. Not only must\nthe parties be free to engage in collective bargaining if they so choose, but\nthey must be permitted to reach their own agreement on their own terms without\ninterference by the public authorities \u2013 subject to certain qualifications for\n\u201ccompelling reasons of national economic interest\u201d (ILO 1994) and to\nreasonable requirements as to form, registration and so on.\n\nArticle 4 has not, however, been interpreted as protecting the right to\nrecognition for purposes of collective bargaining. The supervisory bodies have\nrepeatedly emphasized the desirability of such recognition, but have not been\nprepared to take the further step of determining that refusal to recognize\nand/or the absence of a mechanism whereby employers can be obliged to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong constitutes a breach of\nArticle 4 (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a). They have justified this interpretation on\nthe basis that compulsory recognition would deprive collective bargaining of\nits voluntary character as envisaged by Article 4 (ILO 1995a). As against\nthat, it might be argued that the ostensible right to engage in collective\nbargaining must inevitably be compromised if employers are to be free to\nrefuse to engage in such bargaining notwithstanding that they have the right\nso to bargain if they wish. Furthermore, permitting employers to refuse to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong seems to sit somewhat\nuneasily with the duty to \u201cpromote\u201d collective bargaining, which appears to be\nthe principal purpose of Article 4 (Creighton 1994).\n\n### Application of Freedom of Association Principles in the Context of\nOccupational Safety and Health\n\nIt was suggested earlier that ILO standards relating to occupational safety\nand health endorse the concept of bipartite or tripartite involvement in three\nprincipal contexts: (1) the formulation and implementation of policy at\nnational and regional level; (2) consultation between employers and workers at\nthe level of the workplace; and (3) joint participation between employers and\nworkers in the formulation and implementation of policy at the level of the\nworkplace. It should be clear from the foregoing that the effective\ninvolvement of employers and (especially) workers in all three contexts is\ncrucially dependent upon adequate recognition of their rights of association\nand representation.\n\nRespect for the right to form and to join organizations is clearly an\nessential precondition of all three forms of joint involvement. Consultation\nand participation at the governmental level is feasible only where there are\nstrong and effective organizations which can be seen to be representative of\nthe interests of their constituencies. This is necessary both for ease of\ncommunication and so that government will feel constrained to take seriously\nthe views expressed by the representatives of employers and workers. A\nfortiori, consultation and participation at the level of the workplace is a\nrealistic proposition only if workers have the capacity to form and to join\norganizations which can represent their interests in discussions with\nemployers and their organizations, provide back-up resources for worker\nrepresentatives, assist in dealings with public inspectorates and so on.\nTheoretically, worker representatives could operate at the level of the\nworkplace without having any necessary connection with a more broadly based\norganization, but the reality of power relations in most workplaces is such\nthat they are unlikely to be able to do so in an effective manner without the\nsupport of an industrial organization. At the very least, workers must have\nthe right to have their interests represented in this manner if they so\nchoose.\n\nThe organizational autonomy of employer and worker organizations is also an\nessential precondition of meaningful participation at all levels. It is\nnecessary, for example, that worker organizations should have the right to\nformulate and to implement their policies on occupational safety and health\nissues without outside interference, for purposes of consultation with\ngovernment in relation to: (1) issues such as the legal regulation of\nhazardous processes or substances; or (2) the formulation of legislative\npolicy relating to compensation for work-related injury or the rehabilitation\nof injured workers. Such autonomy is even more important at the level of the\nworkplace, where worker organizations need to develop and maintain a capacity\nto represent the interests of their members in discussion with employers on\noccupational safety and health issues. This might include having rights of\naccess to workplaces for union officials and/or health and safety specialists;\ninvoking the assistance of the public authorities in relation to hazardous\nsituations; and in certain circumstances organizing industrial action in order\nto protect the health and safety of their members.\n\nTo be effective, organizational autonomy also requires that trade union\nmembers and officials be accorded adequate protection against victimization on\ngrounds of their trade union membership or activities, or on account of their\nhaving initiated or participated in legal proceedings relating to occupational\nsafety and health matters. In other words, the guarantees against\ndiscrimination set out in Article 1 of Convention No. 98 are as relevant to\ntrade union activity relating to occupational safety and health as to other\nforms of union activity such as collective bargaining, membership recruitment\nand so on.\n\nThe right to engage in autonomous collective bargaining is also a crucial\nelement in effective worker participation in relation to occupational safety\nand health. The guarantees set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 are\nimportant in this context. However, as indicated, those guarantees do not\nextend to the right to be recognized for purposes of such bargaining. On the\nother hand provisions such as Article 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155) may be seen as coming very close to requiring trade\nunion recognition in the context of occupational safety and health:\n\nThere shall be arrangements at the level of the undertaking under which:\n\n\u00b7 representatives of workers in an undertaking are given adequate information\non measures taken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and\nmay consult their representative organizations about such information provided\nthey do not disclose commercial secrets;\n\n\u00b7 workers and their representatives in the undertaking are given appropriate\ntraining in occupational safety and health;\n\n\u00b7 workers or their representatives and, as the case may be, their\nrepresentative organizations in an undertaking, in accordance with national\nlaw and practice, are enabled to inquire into, and are consulted by the\nemployer on, all aspects of occupational safety and health associated with\ntheir work...\n\nIn practical terms it would be very difficult to give effect to these\nprovisions without according some kind of formal recognition to the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. This in turn serves to emphasize yet again the\nimportance of adequate recognition of rights of association and representation\nas a precondition of the development and implementation of effective\noccupational safety and health strategies at both the national and enterprise\nlevel.\n\n## COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SAFETY AND HEALTH\n\nMichael J. Wright\n\nCollective bargaining is the process through which workers negotiate, as a\ngroup, with their employer; this can occur at various levels (enterprise,\nindustry/sector, national). Traditionally, the subjects of the negotiation are\nwages, benefits, working conditions and fair treatment. However, collective\nbargaining can also address issues that do not directly affect the workers\nemployed in the enterprise, such as increased old-age pensions for workers\nalready retired. Less often, collective bargaining addresses issues that reach\nwell beyond the workplace, such as protection of the external environment.\n\nIn a very small enterprise, it is possible for all the workers to negotiate as\na body with their employer. This kind of informal collective bargaining has\nexisted for centuries. Today, however, most collective bargaining is carried\nout by workers\u2019 organizations, or unions.\n\nThe definition used in the ILO Convention concerning the promotion of\ncollective bargaining, 1981 (No.154), Article 2, is broad:\n\nthe term... extends to all negotiations which take place between an employer,\na group of employers or one or more employers\u2019 organizations, on the one hand,\nand one or more workers\u2019 organizations, on the other, for \u2013\n\n(a) determining working conditions and terms of employment; and/or\n\n(b) regulating relations between employers and workers; and/or\n\n(c) regulating relations between employers or their organizations and a\nworkers\u2019 organization or workers\u2019 organizations.\n\nCollective bargaining is an important tool for raising living standards and\nimproving working conditions. Even though safety and health is addressed in\nthe national law of almost all countries, collective bargaining often provides\nthe mechanism through which the law is implemented in the workplace. For\nexample, the law may mandate joint safety and health committees or works\ncouncils, but leave the details to be negotiated between the employer and the\nworkers\u2019 organization.\n\nUnfortunately, collective bargaining is under attack by authoritarian\nemployers and repressive governments, both in developed and developing\ncountries. It rarely exists in the informal sector or in small, traditional\nenterprises. As a result, the majority of the world\u2019s workers do not yet enjoy\nthe benefits of effective collective bargaining under a framework of worker\nrights guaranteed by law.\n\n### History of Union Action for Safety and Health\n\nThere is a long history of workers\u2019 organizations taking collective action for\nsafety and health. In 1775, Percival Pott, an English surgeon, made the first\nknown report of occupational cancer \u2013 skin cancer in London chimney sweeps\n(Lehman 1977). Two years later the Danish Chimney Sweepers Guild, in what was\nthe first known response by a workers\u2019 organization to the threat of\noccupational cancer, ordered that apprentices be given the means for a daily\nbath.\n\nHowever, safety and health seldom was an explicit issue in early labour\nstruggles. Workers in dangerous jobs were overwhelmed by more pressing\nproblems, such as low wages, crushing hours of work and the arbitrary power of\nfactory and mine owners. Safety hazards were obvious in the daily toll of\ninjury and death, but occupational health was not well understood. Workers\u2019\norganizations were weak and under constant attack by owners and governments.\nSimple survival was the primary goal of workers\u2019 organizations. As a result,\nthe grievances of nineteenth-century workers rarely manifested themselves in\ncampaigns for safer conditions (Corn 1978).\n\n#### The Labour Agreement between the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the\nUnited Steelworkers of America\n\nThe agreement between Bethlehem Steel and the United Steelworkers of America\nis typical of company-wide agreements in large unionized manufacturing\nenterprises in the United States. Steel industry labour agreements have\ncontained safety and health articles for more than 50 years. Many provisions\nnegotiated in the past gave workers and the union rights that were later\nguaranteed by law. Despite this redundancy, the provisions still appear in the\ncontract as a hedge against changes in the law, and to allow the union the\noption of taking violations to impartial arbitration rather than the courts.\n\nThe Bethlehem agreement runs from 1 August 1993 to 1 August 1999. It covers\n17,000 workers in six plants. The full agreement is 275 pages long; 17 pages\nare devoted to safety and health.\n\nSection 1 of the safety and health article pledges the company and the union\nto cooperate in the objective of eliminating accidents and health hazards. It\nobligates the company to provide safe and healthful workplaces, obey federal\nand state law, provide employees with the necessary protective equipment free\nof charge, provide chemical safety information to the union and inform workers\nof the hazards and controls for toxic substances. It grants the union\u2019s\ncentral safety and health department the right to any information in the\ncompany\u2019s possession that is \u201crelevant and material\u201d to an understanding of\npotential hazards. It requires the company to make air sampling tests and\nenvironmental investigations at the request of the union co-chairperson of the\nplant\u2019s safety and health committee.\n\nSection 2 sets up joint union-management safety and health committees at the\nplant and national levels, prescribes the rules under which they operate,\nmandates training for committee members, gives members of the committee access\nto all parts of the plant to facilitate the committee\u2019s work and specifies the\napplicable rates of pay for committee members on committee business. The\nsection also specifies how disputes over protective equipment are to be\nresolved, requires the company to notify the union of all potentially\ndisabling accidents, sets up a system of joint accident investigation,\nrequires the company to gather and supply to the union certain safety and\nhealth statistics, and establishes an extensive safety and health training\nprogramme for all employees.\n\nSection 3 gives workers the right to remove themselves from work involving\nhazards beyond those \u201cinherent in the operation\u201d and provides an arbitration\nmechanism through which disputes over such work refusals can be resolved.\nUnder this provision, a worker cannot be disciplined for acting in good faith\nand on the basis of objective evidence, even if a subsequent investigation\nshows that the hazard did not in fact exist.\n\nSection 4 specifies that the committee\u2019s role is advisory, and that committee\nmembers and officers of the union acting in their official capacity are not to\nbe held liable for injuries or illnesses.\n\nSection 5 states that alcoholism and drug abuse are treatable conditions, and\nsets up a programme of rehabilitation.\n\nSection 6 establishes an extensive programme for controlling carbon monoxide,\na serious hazard in primary steel production.\n\nSection 7 provides workers with vouchers for the purchase of safety shoes.\n\nSection 8 requires the company to keep individual medical records confidential\nexcept in certain limited circumstances. However, workers have access to their\nown medical records, and may release them to the union or to a personal\nphysician. In addition, physicians for the company are required to notify\nworkers of adverse medical findings.\n\nSection 9 establishes a medical surveillance programme.\n\nSection 10 establishes a programme for investigating and controlling the\nhazards of video display terminals.\n\nSection 11 establishes full-time safety representatives in each plant, chosen\nby the union but paid by the company.\n\nIn addition, an appendix to the agreement commits the company and the union to\nreview each plant\u2019s safety programme for mobile equipment operating on rails.\n(Fixed rail equipment is the leading cause of death by traumatic injury in the\nAmerican steel industry.)  \n  \n---  \n  \nHowever, safety and health sometimes joined other issues in early labour\nstruggles. In the late 1820s, workers in the textile industry in the United\nStates began to agitate for shorter working hours. Many of the workers were\nwomen, as were the leaders of such rudimentary unions as the female labour\nreform associations of New England. The proposed 10-hour day was seen mostly\nas an issue of general welfare. But in testimony before the Massachusetts\nlegislature, workers also decried the effects of 12- and 14-hour days in badly\nventilated mills, describing a \u201cwasting sickness\u201d they attributed to cotton\ndust and bad ventilation, in what are now recognized as some of the first\nreports of byssinosis. They had little success in winning recognition from the\nmill owners, or action from the legislature (Foner 1977).\n\nOther union actions dealt more with the effects of occupational hazards than\nwith their prevention. Many nineteenth-century unions adopted welfare\nprogrammes for their members, including disability payments to the injured and\nbenefits for survivors. US and Canadian mining unions went one step further,\nestablishing hospitals, clinics and even cemeteries for their members\n(Derickson 1988). While unions attempted to negotiate better conditions with\nemployers, most agitation for safety and health in North America was in mines\naimed at state and provincial legislatures (Fox 1990).\n\nIn Europe, the situation began to change around the turn of the century with\nthe rise of stronger workers\u2019 organizations. In 1903, the German and French\npainters\u2019 unions began a campaign against the hazards of lead paint. The\nFactory Workers Union of Germany had an active industrial hygiene programme by\n1911, published education materials on chemical hazards and began a campaign\nfor safeguards against chromate-induced lung cancer, ultimately leading to a\nchange in the production method. Trade unions in the United Kingdom\nrepresented their members in workers\u2019 compensation cases and fought for better\nlaws and regulations. Their work showed the interplay between collective\nbargaining for safety and health and the factory inspection system. In 1905,\nfor example, trade unions filed 268 complaints with the British factory\ninspectorate (Teleky 1948). As early as 1942, the Swedish Employers\u2019\nConfederation and the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions reached a\nnationwide Working Environment Agreement regarding local safety and health\nservices. The agreement has been revised and extended several times; in 1976\nthe original parties were joined by the Federation of Salaried Employees\n(Joint Industrial Safety Council of Sweden 1988).\n\nNorth America lagged behind. Formal corporate safety programmes were\ninstituted by some large employers around the turn of the century (for a\ndescription of such programmes in the steel industry see Brody (1960), or the\nself-congratulatory Year Book of the American Iron and Steel Institute for\n1914 (AISI 1915)). The programmes were highly paternalistic, relied more on\ndiscipline than education and often were based on the premise that workers\nthemselves were largely to blame for industrial accidents. Major disasters\nsuch as New York\u2019s 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, which killed 146 workers,\nled to union campaigns for improvement and ultimately to improved fire safety\nlaws. However, safety and health as a widespread labour issue came only with\nthe rise of strong unions in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942, for example, the\nfounding Constitution of the United Steelworkers of America required every\nlocal union to establish a safety and health committee. By the mid-1950s,\njoint labour-management safety and health committees had been established in\nmost unionized mines and manufacturing plants and in many other workplaces in\nthe construction and service sector; most union contracts included a section\non safety and health.\n\n### Process of Collective Bargaining\n\nIt is common to think of collective bargaining as a formal process that occurs\nat regular intervals and which results in a written agreement between the\nworkers\u2019 organization and the employer or employers. This kind of bargaining\npresupposes a succession of demands or proposals, counterproposals and\nextended deliberations. The process can produce a variety of results: a\ncollective bargaining contract, letters of understanding, joint declarations\nor mutually agreed codes of practice.\n\nHowever, collective bargaining can also be understood as a continuous process\nfor solving problems as they arise. This kind of collective bargaining occurs\nevery time a shop steward meets with an area supervisor to settle a dispute or\ngrievance, every time a joint safety and health committee meets to discuss\nproblems in the plant, every time a joint union-management team considers a\nnew company programme.\n\nIt is this flexibility of collective bargaining which helps ensure its\ncontinued viability. There is, however, one precondition for formal or\ninformal bargaining: for negotiations to be a success, the representatives of\nboth sides must have the authority to bargain and to strike a deal that is\nmeant to be honoured.\n\nCollective bargaining is sometimes seen as a test of strength, in which a gain\nfor one side is a loss for the other. A wage increase, for example, is seen as\na threat to profits. A no-layoff agreement is seen as limiting management\u2019s\nflexibility. If bargaining is seen as a contest, it follows that the most\nimportant determinant of the final outcome is the relative power of the\nparties. For the workers\u2019 organization, this means the ability to halt\nproduction through a strike, organize a boycott of the employer\u2019s product or\nservice or bring some other form of pressure to bear, while maintaining the\nloyalty of the organization\u2019s members. For an employer, power means the\nability to resist such pressures, replace the striking workers in countries\nwhere this is permitted or hold out until hardship forces workers back to the\njob under management\u2019s conditions.\n\nOf course, the vast majority of labour negotiations end successfully, without\na work stoppage. Nevertheless, it is the threat of one that leads both sides\nto seek a settlement. This kind of negotiation is sometimes called positional\nbargaining, because it begins with each side taking a position, after which\nboth sides move by increments until a compromise is reached, based on their\nrelative strengths.\n\nA second model of collective bargaining describes it as a mutual search for an\noptimum solution (Fisher and Ury 1981). This kind of bargaining assumes that a\nproper agreement can lead to gains for both parties. A wage increase, for\nexample, can be offset by greater productivity. A no-layoff agreement can\nencourage workers to improve efficiency, since their jobs will not be\nthreatened as a result. Such bargaining is sometimes called \u201cmutual gains\u201d or\n\u201cwin-win\u201d bargaining. What is most important is the ability of each side to\nunderstand the interests of the other and to find solutions that maximize\nboth. Occupational safety and health is frequently seen as an ideal subject\nfor mutual gains bargaining, since both sides are interested in avoiding\noccupational accidents and disease.\n\nIn practice, these models of bargaining are not mutually exclusive and both\nare important. Skilled bargainers will always seek to understand their\ncounterparts and search for areas where both sides can benefit from a wise\nagreement. However, it is unlikely that a party without power will accomplish\nits objectives. There will always remain areas where the parties perceive\ntheir interests to be different. Good faith negotiation works best when both\nsides fear the alternative.\n\nPower is important even in negotiations over safety and health. An enterprise\nmay be less interested in reducing the accident rate if it can externalize the\ncost of the accidents. If injured workers can be replaced easily and cheaply,\nwithout substantial compensation, management may be tempted to avoid expensive\nsafety improvements. This is especially true in the case of occupational\ndiseases with long latency periods, where cost of controls is paid when the\ncontrols are installed, while the benefits may not accrue for many years. As a\nresult, a workers\u2019 organization is more likely to succeed if workers have the\npower to stop production or to call a government inspector if the parties fail\nto negotiate a solution.\n\n### Legal Framework\n\nILO Conventions on freedom of association, on protection of the rights to\norganize and to engage in collective bargaining and the ILO Conventions and\nRecommendations on occupational safety and health recognize the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. While these instruments provide an international\nframework, workers\u2019 rights can be assured only through national law and\nregulation.\n\nOf course, the legal basis for collective bargaining, the level at which\nbargaining occurs and even the process of bargaining all vary by country. The\nlegislation of most industrialized countries includes a system for regulating\ncollective bargaining. Even within Europe, the degree of regulation can differ\nwidely, from a minimal approach in Germany to a much more developed one in\nFrance. The legal effect of a collective agreement also varies. In most\ncountries an agreement is legally enforceable; in the United Kingdom, however,\nagreements are seen as informal, to be applied by virtue of the parties\u2019 good\nfaith backed up by the threat of a work stoppage. It is expected that this\nvariability within Europe will diminish as a result of greater European\nunification.\n\nThe level of bargaining also varies. The United States, Japan and most Latin\nAmerican countries feature bargaining at the level of the individual\nenterprise, although unions often attempt to negotiate \u201cpattern\u201d agreements\nwith all the major employers in a given sector. At the other extreme, Austria,\nBelgium and the Nordic countries tend to have highly centralized bargaining in\nwhich most workplaces are subject to a framework agreement negotiated between\nnational federations representing unions and employers. Sectoral agreements\ncovering particular industries or occupations are common in some countries\nsuch as Germany and France.\n\nFrench-speaking African countries tend to follow the example of France and\nbargain by industry. Some English-speaking developing countries also bargain\nby industry. In others, multiple trade unions bargain on behalf of different\ngroups of workers in a single enterprise.\n\nThe level of bargaining partially determines the coverage of collective\nagreements. In France and Germany, for example, collective agreements are\nusually extended to cover everyone coming within the scope of the occupation\nor industry to which the agreement applies. On the other hand, in the United\nStates and other countries with enterprise-level bargaining, collective\nagreements cover only those workplaces where the union has been recognized as\nthe bargaining agent.\n\nAn even more important factor in determining the coverage of collective\nbargaining is whether national law facilitates or impedes unionization and\ncollective bargaining. For example, public sector employees are not permitted\nto bargain collectively in some countries. In others, public sector unions are\ngrowing rapidly. As a result of such factors, the percentage of workers\ncovered by collective agreements varies from a high of almost 90 per cent in\nGermany and the Nordic countries to under 10 per cent in many developing\ncountries.\n\nThe legal framework also affects how collective bargaining applies to\noccupational safety and health. For example, the United States Occupational\nSafety and Health Act gives workers\u2019 organizations the right to information on\ndangerous chemicals and other hazards in the plant, the right to accompany a\nworkplace inspector and a limited right to participate in legal cases brought\nby the Government against an employer for a violation of standards.\n\nMany countries go further. Most industrialized countries require most\nenterprises to establish joint safety and health committees. The Canadian\nProvince of Ontario requires that certified safety and health representatives\nbe chosen by the workers in most workplaces and given a standard course of\ntraining at employer expense. The Swedish Work Environment Act requires the\nappointment of safety delegates by the local trade union organization. Swedish\nsafety delegates have broad rights to information and consultation. Most\nimportant, they have the power to suspend dangerous work pending a review by\nthe Swedish Labour Inspectorate.\n\nThese laws strengthen the collective bargaining process on issues of safety\nand health. Mandatory joint safety committees provide a routine mechanism for\nnegotiation. Training gives union representatives the knowledge they need to\nparticipate effectively. The right to suspend dangerous work helps keep both\nparties focused on eliminating the source of danger.\n\n### Contract and Labour Law Enforcement\n\nOf course, labour agreements are of limited value without an enforcement\nmechanism. A strike is one method by which a workers\u2019 organization can respond\nto an alleged violation by the employer; conversely, the employer can engage\nin a lockout, denying employment to members of the workers\u2019 organization until\nthe dispute is resolved. However, most labour agreements in developed\ncountries rely on less disruptive methods of enforcement. In fact, many labour\nagreements bar strikes or lockouts during the life of the agreement (no-strike\nclauses or peace obligations). Some restrict them to a limited set of\ncircumstances; for example, the contracts negotiated in the United States\nbetween the United Automobile Workers and the major auto companies allow\nstrikes over unsafe working conditions, but not over wages or benefits during\nthe term of the agreement.\n\nA common enforcement mechanism in developed countries is a system of\narbitration, in which disputes are referred to an impartial referee chosen\njointly by the employer and the workers\u2019 organization. In some cases, disputes\nmay be resolved by the judicial system, either in the regular courts or in\nspecial labour courts or boards. In the United States, for example, a dispute\nover contract interpretation usually will go to arbitration. However, if the\nlosing side refuses to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the winning side\ncan seek to have the decision enforced by the courts. A quasi-judicial body in\nthe United States, the National Labor Relations Board, hears complaints\nconcerning unfair labour practices, such as the failure of one side to bargain\nin good faith. In many other countries, labour courts fulfil this role.\n\n### Collective Bargaining Today\n\nCollective bargaining is a dynamic process in all industrial relations systems\nwhere it is practised. The situation in Europe is changing rapidly. The Nordic\ncountries are characterized by comprehensive working environment agreements\nnegotiated on a national basis, integrated with highly developed national\nlaws. Unionization is very high; labour agreements and the law establish joint\ncommittees and worker safety representatives in most workplaces. Collective\nbargaining mechanisms for safety and health and unionization rates, are less\nextensive in other European countries. Member States of the European Union\nface the task of harmonizing national laws under the Single European Act and\nthe Framework Directive on safety and health (Hecker 1993). European trade\nunions are seeking to coordinate their efforts, primarily through the European\nTrade Union Confederation. There are some signs that national bargaining\nultimately will be replaced or, more likely, supplemented by agreements at the\nEuropean level, although employer resistance to this is high. The first\nexample of such Europe-wide bargaining was over parental leave. In the area of\nsafety and health, the GMB union in the United Kingdom has proposed an\nambitious Europe-wide Work Environment Fund, based on similar funds in the\nNordic Countries.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, are\nchanging even more rapidly. Safety and health regulations were extensive under\nCommunism, but rarely enforced. Trade unions existed, but only under the\ncontrol of the Communist Party. At the enterprise level, unions functioned as\nworkplace labour relations departments, under the control of management,\nwithout any sort of bipartite negotiation. Newly formed independent unions\nhelped precipitate the fall of Communism; sometimes their issues concerned\nworking conditions or such basic sanitary measures as the provision of soap in\ncoal mine wash houses. Today, the old unions are gone or are struggling to\nreconstitute themselves. The new independent unions are attempting to change\nfrom political organizations confronting the government, to collective\nbargaining organizations representing their members in the workplace. Bad and\noften deteriorating working conditions will continue to be an important issue.\n\nThe Japanese system of worker participation, continuous improvement and\nextensive training effectively promotes safety and health, but only where\nsafety and health are explicit goals of the enterprise. Most Japanese unions\nexist only at the enterprise level; negotiations take place through a system\nof continuous joint consultation (Inohara 1990). Joint safety and health\ncommittees are established by the Labour Safety and Sanitation Law of 1972, as\namended.\n\nLabour agreements in the United States contain relatively extensive safety and\nhealth articles for two reasons. First, safety and health is an important\nissue for North American unions, as it is for workers\u2019 organizations in all\nindustrialized countries. However, safety and health laws in the United States\nlack many of the provisions found in the laws of other countries, forcing\nunions to bargain for rights and protections guaranteed elsewhere by law. For\nexample, joint union-management safety and health committees are generally\nrecognized as an important mechanism for day-to-day cooperation and\nnegotiation between workers and employers. However, there is no requirement in\nthe US Occupational Safety and Health Act for such committees. As a result,\nunions must bargain for them. And since the rate of unionization is low in the\nUnited States, most workers do not have access to joint committees. Many\nunions in the United States also have negotiated contract clauses barring\nretaliation against workers who refuse to work under abnormally hazardous\nconditions, since legal protections are weak and uncertain.\n\nCanadian law varies from province to province, although it is generally\nstronger than in the United States. For example, unions in Canada do not need\nto negotiate for the existence of safety and health committees, although they\nmay negotiate for larger ones, with more powers. Safety and health committees\nare also required under Mexican law.\n\nThe situation in developing countries is mixed. Workers\u2019 organizations in\ndeveloping countries like India, Brazil and Zimbabwe place a growing emphasis\non safety and health through agitation for improved laws and through\ncollective bargaining. For example, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has\nfought to extend the national labour code, including its safety and health\nprovisions, to the country\u2019s export processing zones (see box). But trade\nunions are severely restricted or suppressed in many parts of the world and\nthe vast majority of workers in developing countries do not belong to any\nworkers\u2019 organization or benefit from collective bargaining.\n\n#### Trade Union Action in Zimbabwe\n\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), has launched a National Campaign\nfor the Rights of Injured Workers, which combines national level and shop\nfloor action to seek amended laws and improved collective agreements.\n\nZimbabwean law has since 1990 provided for safety committees, health and\nsafety representatives and health and safety supervisors at all workplaces.\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has insisted that worker health and\nsafety representatives must be elected by workers. Its National Campaign\ncovers these demands:\n\n1\\. Safe work. This involves identification of workplace hazards through\nsurveys and accident investigation, as well as negotiating to improve\nconditions.\n\n2\\. Worker and union participation in workers\u2019 health issues. This includes\nthe rights of workers to elect their own health and safety representatives, to\nobtain information such as safety data sheets and factory inspector\u2019s reports,\nand jointly to investigate and report accidents and injuries (as in Sweden).\n\n3\\. Adequate compensation and care for injured workers. This extends to a\nreview of compensation levels.\n\n4\\. Job security for injured workers. Trade union representatives have\nnegotiated a right to return to work and be assisted in placement.\n\nFor the ZCTU, a key step in accident prevention has been its training\nprogramme to increase effective worker participation in health and safety at\nthe shop floor level. The training for worker representatives has been in\ncarrying out walk-through surveys at workplaces and in reporting on any\nhazards identified \u2013 first to workers and then to management for discussion.\nOnce in operation, union health and safety representatives have been involved\nin inspections and in ensuring that injuries are reported. This is\nparticularly important in sectors that would otherwise be inaccessible, such\nas agriculture.\n\nThe ZCTU has also demanded an increase in penalties that may be imposed on\nemployers found to have infringed health and safety laws.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Loewenson 1992).  \n  \n---  \n  \n### The Future of Collective Bargaining\n\nWorkers\u2019 organizations and collective bargaining face difficult challenges in\nthe years ahead. Virtually all collective bargaining takes place at the\nenterprise, industry or national level. In contrast, the economy is\nincreasingly global. Apart from Europe, however, workers\u2019 organizations have\nyet to develop effective mechanisms for bargaining across national boundaries.\nSuch bargaining is a top priority for international labour federations. It can\nbest be promoted through stronger and more effective international union\nstructures, strong social clauses in world trade agreements and appropriate\ninternational instruments, such as those of the International Labour\nOrganization. For example, the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Multinational\nEnterprises refers specifically to both collective bargaining and occupational\nsafety and health. Many unions are developing direct links with their\ncounterparts in other countries in order to coordinate their bargaining and\nprovide mutual assistance. One example is the relationship between mining\nunions in the United States and Colombia (Zinn 1995).\n\nRapid changes in technology and work organization can overwhelm existing\nlabour agreements. Workers\u2019 organizations are attempting to develop a form of\ncontinuous bargaining to respond to workplace change. Workers\u2019 organizations\nhave long recognized the links between the working environment and the\nexternal environment. Some unions have begun to address issues of the external\nenvironment in their collective bargaining agreements and in their membership\neducation programmes. An example is the Model Environment Agreement proposed\nby the Manufacturing-Science-Finance (MSF) Union in the United Kingdom.\n\nA fundamental purpose of trade unions is to take human rights and human\nwelfare out of economic competition \u2013 to prevent an enterprise or a nation\nfrom seeking a competitive advantage by impoverishing its workers and forcing\nthem to work under dangerous conditions. Collective bargaining is vital to\nsafety and health. However, workers\u2019 organizations are essential to collective\nbargaining and workers\u2019 organizations are under attack in many developed and\ndeveloping countries. The survival and growth of workers\u2019 organizations will\nlargely determine whether most workers enjoy rising living standards and\nimproved working conditions, or face a deteriorating cycle of poverty, injury\nand disease.\n\n## NATIONAL LEVEL TRIPARTITE AND BIPARTITE COOPERATION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nRobert Husbands\n\nCooperation between workers, employers and government in the elaboration and\nimplementation of occupational health and safety measures at the national or\nregional level is common in a significant number of countries. It is not\nunusual for interest groups and technical experts also to be involved in this\nprocess. Such cooperation is highly developed and has been institutionalized\nin a number of countries by the establishment of consultative and\ncollaborative organizations. These organizations have normally been widely\naccepted by all labour market participants as there appears to be a general\nconsensus that health and safety at work is a subject of common concern where\ndialogue between the social partners, the government and other interested\nparties is extremely important.\n\nThe institutions which have been established to facilitate this cooperation\nvary significantly in form. One approach is to establish consultative\norganizations either on an ad hoc or a permanent basis to give advice to the\ngovernment on questions of occupational safety and health policy. The\ngovernment is normally not obligated to follow the recommendations offered,\nbut in practice they are difficult to ignore and are frequently taken into\nconsideration in the elaboration of government policy.\n\nThe other approach is to have the social partners and other interested parties\nactively cooperate with the government in public institutions which have been\nestablished to implement occupational safety and health policy. Participation\nby non-governmental actors in public institutions with responsibility for\nhealth and safety questions at work is normally undertaken through the\nrepresentation of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and, in some cases,\nother parties, on the board of directors of the public institution concerned,\nalthough sometimes participation extends to the management and even the\nproject level. In most cases these persons are nominated by the government on\nrecommendation of the parties to be represented, although in some cases\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the right to directly nominate\ntheir representatives to these collaborative institutions. Bodies at the\nnational level (or regional, state or provincial level) are normally\ncomplemented by structures or arrangements at the industry, enterprise and\nplant level.\n\n### Advice on Policy and Standard Setting\n\nProbably the most common form of cooperation involves the establishment of\nconsultative organizations to give advice on policy and standard setting.\nExamples of this can vary between a modest approach, which involves the\nexpenditure of relatively few resources, to more institutionalized approaches,\nwhich involve more significant amounts of resources. The United States is an\nexample of a country where a more limited approach has been adopted. At the\nfederal level, the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and\nHealth, established pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of\n1970, is the principal permanent advisory committee. This committee, according\nto the Act, is to be composed of representatives of management, labor,\noccupational safety and health professionals and the public, with a member of\nthe public acting as the chairperson. The committee makes recommendations to\nthe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In\npractice, however, this committee has not met frequently. The members of the\ncommittee are not compensated and the Secretary of Labor has provided from its\nbudget an executive secretary and other support services as needed. The costs\nof maintaining this committee in existence are therefore very low, although\nbudgetary constraints now call even this support into question. A permanent\ncommittee of a similar character, the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational\nSafety and Health, was established in July 1971 pursuant to Executive Order\n11612 to advise the Secretary of Labour on matters relating to the safety and\nhealth of federal workers.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 also provides for the\nestablishment of ad hoc advisory committees to assist in standard-setting\nfunctions. These advisory committees are appointed by the Secretary of Labor\nand are to consist of no more than 15 members, including one or more persons\nwho are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Each\nstandard-setting committee is to include an equal number of representatives of\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. The Secretary of Labor may also appoint\none or more representatives of state health and safety agencies, as well as\ntechnical experts who could be, for example, representatives of professional\norganizations of technicians or professionals specializing in occupational\nhealth or safety, or of nationally recognized standards-producing\norganizations. Extensive use has been made of such standard-setting\ncommittees, which are sometimes in existence several years to accomplish the\nwork that has been assigned to them. Meetings can be frequent, depending on\nthe nature of the tasks to be performed. Although committee members are\nnormally not paid, they are normally reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses\nand support services for the activity of these committees have been paid for\nby the Department of Labor as well in the past. Committees have been\nconstituted to recommend standards with respect to agriculture, asbestos dust,\ncarcinogens, coke oven emissions, cutaneous hazards, hazardous materials\nlabelling, heat stress, marine terminal facilities, noise, longshoring safety\nand health, shipyard employment standards and steel erection rules, among\nother things.\n\nOther ad hoc advisory committees of a similar character have been established\npursuant to similar legislation which falls under the authority of the\nSecretary of Labor. For example, a number of standard-setting committees have\nbeen established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\nThe costs involved in the establishment of such standard-setting committees,\nhowever, are relatively modest and are characterized by relatively low\nadministrative costs, little infrastructure, voluntary participation by\noutside parties without compensation and dissolution of the committees upon\ncompletion of their tasks.\n\nMore elaborate institutionalized forms of consultation are, however, found in\nother countries. In the Netherlands, for example, the pre-eminent organization\nis the Working Environment Council, which was established pursuant to the\nWorking Environmental Council Act 1990. The Council gives its views to the\nMinistry of Social Affairs and Employment, either when asked or on its own\ninitiative, comments on proposed new acts and decrees and can bring forward\nits own proposals for new policy or legislation. The Council also gives its\nviews about the advisability of making grants-in-aid for research on working\nenvironment issues, about the issuance of exemptions, the formulation of\ngovernment guidance and the policy of the Labour Inspectorate. The Council is\ncomprised of eight representatives from central employers\u2019 organizations,\neight from central workers\u2019 organizations and seven from governmental bodies.\nOnly the representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the\nright to vote, however, and the chairperson of the Council is independent. The\nCouncil meets every month. In addition, the Council has approximately 15\ndifferent working committees for specific issues and, in addition, ad hoc\nworking groups are established for detailed subjects when the subject matter\njustifies it. Within the working committees and working groups, external\nexperts play an important role and these working organizations prepare reports\nand papers which are discussed at Council meetings and often form the basis\nfor positions which are subsequently taken. The recommendations of the Council\nare comprehensive and are published. Although normally the parties try to\nachieve a consensus position, separate views can be expressed to the Minister\nof Social Affairs and Employment when employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives\ncannot find common ground. More than 100 persons are involved in the work of\nthe Council and its subsidiary organizations and thus it is supported by\nsignificant financial and administrative resources.\n\nOther less prominent consultative organizations exist in the Netherlands for\nmore specific occupational safety and health issues. These include the\nFoundation for the Working Environment in Building Construction, the\nFoundation for Health Care in Agriculture, the Commission for the Prevention\nof Disasters by Dangerous Substances and the Commission for the Labour\nInspectorate and Enforcement Policy.\n\nExamples of other countries which have consultative organizations of a\nbipartite, tripartite or multipartite character to give recommendations on\noccupational safety and health policy and standards include: Canada (ad hoc\ncommittees on legislative reform and standard setting \u2013 federal level; Forum\nfor Action on Workplace Health and Safety \u2013 Alberta; Joint Steering Committee\non Hazardous Substances in the Workplace \u2013 Ontario; Back Injury Prevention\nAdvisory Committee \u2013 Newfoundland; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013\nPrince Edward Island; Advisory Council on Workplace Safety and Health \u2013\nManitoba; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013 Saskatchewan; Logging\nSafety Forum \u2013 British Columbia); Denmark (Working Environment Council);\nFrance (the Central Council for the Prevention of Occupational Risks and the\nNational Commission of Occupational Health and Safety in Agriculture); Italy\n(Permanent Consultative Commission for the Prevention of Work Accidents and\nOccupational Health); Germany (Advisory Board to the Federal Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health); and Spain (General Council of the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health).\n\n### Policy Implementation\n\nA number of countries have bipartite, tripartite or multipartite organizations\nwhich are also active in policy implementation. These collaborative\norganizations normally are public establishments which incorporate\nrepresentatives of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and in some cases\nother persons or interest groups, in both policy making and policy\nimplementation. Normally far larger than advisory committees, councils or\ncommissions, these collaborative organizations have responsibility for\nimplementing government policy, frequently manage large budgetary resources\nand often have significant numbers of personnel.\n\nAn example of such an organization is the Health and Safety Commission in\nGreat Britain. The Commission was established pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Health and Safety Act 1974. It has as its mandate to ensure that adequate\nmeasures are taken to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons at\nwork; to protect the public against risks to health and safety arising out of\nwork; to control storage and use of explosives, highly flammable materials and\nother dangerous substances; and to control the emission of noxious or\noffensive substances from the workplace. It is responsible to the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment, but also to other Secretaries of State,\nincluding those of Trade and Industry, Transport, Environment and Agriculture.\nThe Commission has nine persons, all of whom are appointed by the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment. It consists of a chairperson, three\nmembers appointed after consultation with the principal central employers\u2019\norganization, three members appointed after consultation with the principal\ncentral workers\u2019 organization and two members appointed after consultation\nwith local authority associations.\n\nThe Commission is assisted by a number of subsidiary organizations (figure\n21.3). The most important of these is the Health and Safety Executive, a\ndistinct statutory body which consists of a governing body of three persons\nappointed by the Commission with the approval of the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Employment. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for\ncarrying out the substantive work of the Commission, including the enforcement\nof health and safety standards under the Health and Safety Act 1974 and other\nfunctions delegated to it by the Commission. Local authorities also perform\nenforcement functions with respect to certain health and safety legislation as\nwell. In addition, the Commission is assisted in its work by a number of\nadvisory committees which are, depending on the committee, bipartite,\ntripartite or multipartite in character. These advisory committees are\norganized both by subject matter and industry. There are advisory committees\nfor each of the following subjects: toxic substances, dangerous pathogens,\ndangerous substances, genetic modifications, occupational health, releases to\nthe environment, nuclear installations and ionizing radiation. There are also\nadvisory committees for the following industries: agriculture, ceramics,\nconstruction, education, foundries, health, petroleum, paper and board,\nprinting, railways, rubber, cotton and textiles. Subject matter committees\ntend to have between 12 and 18 members plus a chairperson and are multipartite\nin character, frequently including technical experts as well as\nrepresentatives of central workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations, government\nand other interest groups. Industry committees, however, tend to be bipartite,\nwith approximately 12 members drawn in equal numbers from central workers\u2019 and\nemployers\u2019 organizations and with the chairperson being from the government.\nThe resources at the disposition of the Commission and the Health and Safety\nExecutive are substantial. For example, in 1993 these organizations together\nhad approximately 4,538 staff members and a budget of \u00a3 211.8 million.\n\n#### Figure 21.3 Health & safety in Great Britain: the main institutions\n\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel03fe.gif)\n\nOther examples of collaborative organizations in this field can be found in\nCanada. At the federal level, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and\nSafety is Canada\u2019s main resource for information on this topic. The Centre\nalso promotes health and safety in the workplace, facilitates the\nestablishment of high standards of occupational health and safety and assists\nin the development of programmes and policies to reduce or eliminate\noccupational hazards. The Centre, created by an act of parliament in 1978, was\ngiven a tripartite governing body to ensure its impartiality in occupational\nhealth and safety matters, including being an unbiased source of information.\nIts governing council consists of a chairperson and 12 governors \u2013 four\nrepresenting the federal, provincial and territorial governments; four\nrepresenting labour; and four representing employers. The Centre manages\nsignificant human and financial resources and its total expenditures in 1993\nwere approximately C$8.3 million.\n\nIn some provinces there are also collaborative organizations. In Quebec, two\nprominent organizations are the Commission for Occupational Health and Safety\nand the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research. The Commission\nhas two functions. The first is to develop and implement occupational health\nand safety policy, including the establishment of standards and their\nenforcement; the provision of support for the implementation of prevention\nprogrammes, participation mechanisms and health services; and the provision of\ntraining, information and research services. The second is to provide payment\nto workers injured on the job and to manage an insurance fund for this purpose\nto which employers must contribute. The Commission, which was established by\nlaw in 1981 and which succeeded the Commission of Occupational Accidents\nfounded in 1931, has a bipartite board of directors which is composed of seven\nworkers\u2019 representatives, seven representatives of employers and a\nchairperson. The representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations are\nchosen from lists supplied by the most representative labour and employer\norganizations. The Commission manages large human and financial resources and\nat the end of 1992 had expenditures of C$2,151.7 million and employed 3,013\npersons as permanent staff and 652 as casual employees.\n\nQuebec\u2019s Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research, founded in\n1980, has as its mandate to contribute, through scientific research, to the\nidentification and the elimination of sources of workplace hazards, as well as\nto the readaptation of workers who have suffered workplace injuries. The board\nof directors of the Institute is the same as that of the Commission for\nOccupational Health and Safety, notwithstanding that it is an independent\ninstitution. The Institute also has a scientific council which has advisory\nfunctions and is composed of four representatives of workers\u2019 organizations,\nfour from employers\u2019 organizations, six representatives of the scientific and\ntechnical community and the Institute\u2019s Director General. In 1992, the\nInstitute had expenditures of C$17.9 million and approximately 126 employees.\n\nThe Ontario Workplace Health and Safety Agency, established in 1990 by\namendment of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, also has responsibility\nfor developing and implementing policy and for managing occupational health\nand safety programmes in Ontario. The governing body of the organization\nconsists of a bipartite board of 18 persons with nine representatives each\nfrom workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. Of these representatives, one\nrepresentative of labour and one of management serve as joint chief executive\nofficers. The resources of this organization are substantial \u2013 total\nexpenditures amounted to C$64.9 million in 1992.\n\nOne country with a long tradition of collaborative organizations in the field\nof occupational safety and health, Sweden, decided to reject this form of\norganization in 1992 and has subsequently used advisory organizations instead.\nIt should be added that this decision was not confined to occupational safety\nand health, but included all collaborative organizations of any kind in which\nrepresentatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations played a decision-\nmaking role at the national level. The impetus for this change came from the\nprincipal employers\u2019 organization, which decided unilaterally to withdraw from\nparticipation in collaborative public institutions. The central employers\u2019\norganization argued that interest groups should not have political\nresponsibility in terms of managing public institutions, but that the\ngovernment and parliament should have this political role and responsibility;\nthat the role of the employers\u2019 organization was to represent its members\u2019\ninterests, and that this role could be in conflict with a duty to serve the\ninterests of the public institutions if the employers\u2019 organization was\nrepresented on the governing boards of such institutions; and that\nparticipation weakened democracy and the development of public institutions.\nAlthough workers\u2019 organizations were not in agreement with the employers\u2019\norganizations on these points, the government concluded that collaborative\nbodies with no representation from the principal employers\u2019 organization were\nimpractical and decided to have representation by workers\u2019 and employers\u2019\norganizations as well as other interest groups only on advisory bodies. Hence,\norganizations in the field of occupational safety and health such as the\nNational Board of Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of\nOccupational Health and the Working Life Fund, which had formerly been\ncollaborative in character in terms of a tripartite or multipartite governing\nboard, were restructured.\n\nAlthough collaborative organizations in most countries are more rare than\nadvisory organizations, which are quite widespread, the case of Sweden\u2019s\nrejection of collaborative institutions, at least in the field of occupational\nsafety and health, appears to be an isolated one. Although some collaborative\ninstitutions, dealing notably with questions of economic policy, training and\nemployment, were dismantled in Great Britain during the 1980s and 1990s by\nsuccessive conservative governments, the Health and Safety Commission was not\naffected. Some have advanced that this is because occupational safety and\nhealth is a subject of common concern to employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations\nas well as the government and other interested parties and therefore there is\na strong interest by all parties in finding a consensus in both policy\nformulation and implementation. Also, in Canada such collaborative\ninstitutions have been created at both the federal level and in some provinces\nprecisely because a collaborative approach was deemed more useful in finding a\nconsensus between the labour market parties and because administration of the\noccupational safety and health laws would appear more impartial and fair to\nthose affected by them.\n\nOn a broader level, however, there are two national consultative bodies which\nare also concerned with occupational safety and health issues as part of their\nmore general mandate to address all important social and economic questions of\nnational importance. In the Netherlands, the Labour Foundation, established in\nMay 1945, is a bipartite organization jointly managed by equal numbers of\nrepresentatives from central employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations (including\nfarmers) and has a significant role as an advisory body to the Government.\nAlthough historically its main function has concerned questions of wage\npolicy, it also expresses its views on other conditions of work. The other\nnational consultative body of importance is the Social and Economic Council,\nwhich was founded in 1950 pursuant to the Act on Statutory Trade Associations.\nThe tripartite Council consists of 15 representatives of central employers\u2019\norganizations, 15 representatives of central workers\u2019 organizations and 15\nindependent experts. The employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives are appointed\nby their organizations and the independent experts are appointed by the Crown.\nIn making its appointments, the Crown also tries to have a balance between the\nmajor political parties. The Council is independent of the government and is\nfinanced by a mandatory tax on employers.\n\nThe Council has a multimillion dollar budget and its own Secretariat. The\nCouncil normally meets once a month and is assisted by a number of permanent\nand ad hoc committees, which are frequently also constituted on a tripartite\nbasis. The government is required by law to submit all proposals for social\nand economic legislation to the Council for its advice and any labour\nlegislation \u2013 which would include proposals concerning occupational safety and\nhealth \u2013 comes before the Council.\n\nIt should be added that a number of countries require that workplace health\nand safety committees should or may be established for enterprises which have\nmore than a certain number of employees. These committees are bipartite in\nnature and include representatives of the employers and the workers. These\ncommittees normally have as their function to investigate and propose all ways\nand means of actively contributing to measures undertaken to ensure the best\npossible health and safety conditions in the establishment, a role which can\ninclude the promotion and monitoring of health and safety conditions in the\nenterprise to ensure, among other things, adherence to applicable law and\nregulations. These joint committees are normally advisory in character.\nWorkplace health and safety committees, for example, are legally required in\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.\n\n## FORMS OF WORKERS\u2019 PARTICIPATION\n\nMuneto Ozaki and Anne Trebilcock\n\nThe phrase workers\u2019 participation is used loosely to encompass various forms\nof workers\u2019 participation in decision making, usually at the enterprise level.\nThey complement other forms that may exist at the industrial or sectoral level\nand the national level, such as bodies for tripartite cooperation. The types\nof workers\u2019 participation arrangement differ widely with regard to their\nfunctions and powers, ranging from informal individual employee suggestion\nschemes to co-determination of certain matters by workers\u2019 representatives\ntogether with management. The mechanisms used for encouraging employee\nparticipation vary so widely that it is impossible to review them fully here.\nThe main forms that have attracted recent interest, particularly in the field\nof work organization, are reviewed below; to these could be added the\nhistorical example of self-management by workers in former Yugoslavia. As\nparticularly relevant today, joint safety and health committees are examined\nas a special form of workers\u2019 participation within the larger labour relations\ncontext.\n\nThe idea of workers\u2019 participation arose in Europe, where collective\nbargaining has usually been at the branch or industry level; this often left a\ngap of employee representation at the enterprise or plant level, which became\nfilled by bodies such as works councils, works committees, enterprise\ncommittees and so forth. Many developing countries have also adopted\nlegislative initiatives with a view to having works councils or similar\nstructures set up (e.g., Pakistan, Thailand, Zimbabwe) as a means of promoting\nlabour-management cooperation. The relationship of these bodies to trade\nunions and collective bargaining has been the subject of considerable\nlegislation and negotiation. This is reflected in a provision of the ILO\nWorkers\u2019 Representatives Convention, 1971 (No. 135), which states that where\nboth trade union representatives and elected representatives exist in the same\nundertaking, measures shall be taken to ensure that the existence of those\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade union\n(Article 5).\n\n### Direct Participation\n\nWorkers may participate in decision making either directly themselves or\nindirectly through their representatives \u2013 trade unions or elected employee\nrepresentatives. Since the 1980s, there has been a spread of direct\nparticipation by workers, if the term participation is understood as the\nexercise of any influence on their work or how it is to be carried out. Thus\nworkers may \u201cparticipate\u201d in work-related decisions not only when there is an\ninstitution, such as a quality circle, at the workplace. Accordingly, a simple\nexercise of work enrichment may be a form of promoting direct participation of\nworkers.\n\nDirect participation may be on an individual basis \u2013 for example, through\nsuggestion schemes or \u201cenriched\u201d work. It may also be on a group basis \u2013 for\nexample, in quality circles or similar small-group activities. Teamwork in\nitself constitutes a form of group-based direct participation. Direct\nparticipation may be integrated into decisions about daily work, or it may\ntake place outside daily work, such as in a voluntary quality circle that cuts\nacross the group structure habitually used. Direct participation may also be\n\u201cconsultative\u201d or \u201cdeliberative\u201d; research by the European Foundation for the\nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions has explored this particular\naspect in some detail (Regalia and Gill 1996). With consultative\nparticipation, employees are encouraged and enabled, either as individuals or\nmembers of a group, to make their views known, but it is up to management to\naccept or reject their proposals. Deliberative participation, on the other\nhand, places some of traditional management responsibility in the employees\u2019\nhands, as in the case of teamworking or semi-autonomous work groups wherein\nsome authority has been delegated to the workers.\n\n### Works Councils and Similar Structures; Co-determination\n\nThe term works councils describes arrangements for the representation of\nemployees, usually at the plant level although they also exist at higher\nlevels (company, group of companies, industry, European Union). The\nrelationship to trade unions is often delineated by legislation or clarified\nby collective agreement, but tensions between these institutions sometimes\nremain all the same. Extensive use of works councils, sometimes called\nworkers\u2019 committees, cooperation committees or otherwise, is well established\nin a number of European countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany\nand the Netherlands and, under the impetus of Directive No. 94/45/EC of 1994\non European works councils, can be anticipated to spread in that region for\nlarge enterprises. Several Central and Eastern European countries, such as\nHungary and Poland, have enacted legislation to encourage the emergence of\nworks councils. They are found as well in some countries in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America; part of the post-apartheid labour law reform in South Africa,\nfor instance, included establishing a form of works councils alongside trade\nunion structures.\n\nThe possible powers of works councils are best illustrated by the example of\nGermany, although in some ways it is a unique case. Weiss (1992) describes the\nworks council in that country as the form of institutionalized representation\nof interests for employees within an establishment. A works council enjoys\ncertain rights to information, consultation (as in all countries) and co-\ndetermination (much more rare). As the most far-reaching form of\nparticipation, co-determination covers participation in arrangements on health\nand safety at work and the formal adoption of a reconciliation of interests\nand a \u201csocial plan\u201d in the event of a substantial alteration in the\nestablishment, such as a plant closure. Co-determination rights also extend to\nguidelines for staff selection and appraisal, in-service training and measures\naffecting individual workers such as grading, transfer and dismissal. The\nGerman works council is empowered to conclude works agreements at the\nenterprise level and can initiate complaints where it believes the agreement\nis not being honoured. Included in the areas of obligatory collective co-\ndetermination are accident prevention and health protection, works rules,\nworking time, the fixing of performance-related pay rates, the manner of\npayment, general principles governing holidays and others. On these matters,\nthe employer cannot take action without the works council\u2019s agreement. The\nworks council also has the right to take the initiative and can refer a matter\nto the establishment-level arbitration committee for enforcement. As Weiss\n(1992) characterizes it, the works council\u2019s role is \u201cparticipating in the\n\u2018how\u2019 after the employer has made a decision on the \u2018whether\u2019\u201d. The right to\nconsultation affords the works council a chance to play a part in the\ndecisions made by the employer, but failure to consult will not invalidate the\ndecision. The subjects on which consultation is required include protection\nagainst dismissal, protection against technical hazards, training and\npreparation of a social plan.\n\nThe works council must observe the principles of cooperation with the employer\nand the peace obligation (no work stoppages); it also must cooperate with\ntrade unions present and with the appropriate employers\u2019 organization. Works\ncouncils are bound to conduct their business impartially, without regard to\nrace, religion or creed, nationality, origin, political or union activity, sex\nor age of the employees. The employer provides the facilities for the works\ncouncil, funds it and is liable for its actions.\n\nWorks councils are elected separately for manual and non-manual workers in\nGermany. Special works council elections are held; while there is no legal\nconnection between these representatives and trade union officers in fact,\nthey often coincide. In Austria and Germany, special representation is ensured\nfor disabled workers and young workers and trainees.\n\nWorks council members receive no remuneration for this, but necessarily\nincurred expenses are reimbursed. Members are guaranteed retention of their\npay level and job grading after the term of office has expired and enjoy\nspecial protection against dismissal. They are entitled to release from work\nto conduct works council business and attend training. Such protections are in\nline with the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135), which calls for\nworkers\u2019 representatives in an undertaking to enjoy effective protection\nagainst any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their\nstatus or activities as a workers\u2019 representative (Article 1).\n\nMany countries feature less ambitious works council schemes that provide for\ninformation and consultation rights. Especially where trade unions have little\npresence on the shop floor level, there is considerable interest in\nintroducing works councils or workers\u2019 committees as a means for workers to\nhave a voice at the workplace level.\n\n### Quality Circles and Total Quality Management\n\nQuality circles and other similar group activities were rapidly introduced in\na large number of enterprises in some Western European countries (e.g., the\nUnited Kingdom and France) at the start of the 1980s and in the United States\na little earlier. They built upon \u201cQuality of Working Life\u201d (QWL) or\n\u201cHumanization of Work\u201d programmes that began in the early 1970s. Their spread\nwas considerably later in some other Western countries (e.g., Germany) and\nstill seems to be very limited in countries where joint project groups are the\npredominant means of dealing with work organization, such as Sweden. They were\nstimulated by a belief that Japan\u2019s ability to produce innovative and high-\nquality products at low cost had something to do with the way human resources\nwere managed in that country; quality circles were the most visible and easily\ntransplantable feature of Japanese human resource management. Quality circles\nare generally expected to produce two types of effect: one is the enhancement\nof quality and productivity and the other is the fostering of a sense of\nparticipation in work-related decisions among workers, leading to increased\njob satisfaction and better industrial relations. In Japan the emphasis has\nbeen placed more on the first aspect and in Europe and North America on the\nsecond. There are also structural differences: while circle leaders are\nnormally appointed by management in Japan, they are often elected in Germany.\nToday, the emphasis of QWL programmes is more on enhancing productivity and\ncompetitiveness (Ozaki 1996).\n\nIn some of the countries where quality circles were experimented with widely\nin the 1980s, such as France and the United Kingdom, there has been a certain\ndisenchantment with their relative ineffectiveness in producing the expected\nresults. Many circles disappeared a few years after their creation; many\nothers exist on paper, but are in fact moribund. The failure has been\nattributed to many factors \u2013 their tendency to create confusion in the normal\nlines of command, non-management control over membership, circles\u2019 determining\ntheir own agenda without heed for management priorities, lack of enthusiasm or\nhostility on the part of middle management, absence of durable commitment on\nthe part of top management and restriction of scope to minor work-related\nissues.\n\nRealization of these shortcomings led to the formation of a theory of \u201cTotal\nQuality Management\u201d (TQM). Certain principles of TQM have implications for\nemployee participation: all employees are to participate in the process of\nimproving the business, and responsibility for quality is to be assigned to\npeople who in fact control the quality of what they do. Thus TQM encourages\njob enlargement and enrichment leading to semi-autonomous work groups. It also\npromotes horizontal coordination in a firm through, for example, the use of ad\nhoc, multi-functional or interdepartmental project teams.\n\n### Joint Project Groups\n\nThe practice of establishing joint project groups to study the best ways of\nintroducing technological or organizational changes through the joint efforts\nof managers and workers is a traditional feature of labour relations in some\ncountries, such as Sweden. A joint project group is normally composed of\nmanagers, workplace union representatives and shop-floor workers and often\nassisted by outside experts. The management and the union concerned often\nestablish joint project groups separately on four issues: new technology, work\norganization, training and work environment. The Swedish model of joint\nproject groups presents a notable example of direct participation of shop-\nfloor workers within a framework of established collective labour relations.\nThe system is also found in other countries, such as Germany and Japan.\n\n### Semi-autonomous Group Work and Teamwork\n\nSemi-autonomous group work and teamwork are both forms of on-line direct\nparticipation of shop-floor workers in work-related decisions, unlike the\nabove-mentioned joint project group work, which is a form of off-line\nparticipation. The main difference between the two forms of participation lies\nin the degree of autonomy which the members of the team or group enjoy in\norganizing their work. Semi-autonomous group work was used extensively in\nScandinavia, although recently there has been a move back to a more\ntraditional approach; there have been experiments with it elsewhere in Europe\nas well.\n\nWhile experiments with semi-autonomous group work are generally declining,\nteamwork is spreading fast throughout Western countries. The degree of\nautonomy which a team enjoys varies widely from one company to another. Team\nstructure also differs. In many countries, team leaders are usually appointed\nby management, but in a few countries (e.g., Germany) they are often elected\nby co-workers. Frequently, the creation of teams is accompanied by significant\nchanges in the role of first-line supervisors; they tend to take on greater\nresponsibility for advising team members and for both vertical and horizontal\ncommunication, but lose their supervisory role. Employers have shown\nincreasing interest in teamwork because it tends to facilitate the upgrading\nof workers\u2019 skills and widens the range of workers\u2019 tasks, thus allowing\ngreater flexibility in production processes. However, it is sometimes\ncriticized by workers as a means of inducing them to work harder \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\nby substituting co-workers\u2019 pressure for management control.\n\n### Employee Representation on Supervisory Boards; Employee Shareholding\n\nSome commentators include forms of employee ownership or representation on\ncompany boards as expressions of workers\u2019 participation. In Germany and the\nScandinavian countries, among others, workers have indirect participation\nabove the enterprise level by the inclusion of workers\u2019 representatives on\nsupervisory boards. This involves incorporating workers\u2019 representatives in\nthe traditional company board structure, where they are in a minority\n(although sometimes, as in Germany, a numerous one). It does not necessarily\nimply participation in the active management of the company and the workers\u2019\nrepresentatives have the same status as other board members. This means they\nare to put the interests of the company first and foremost and are bound by\nthe same duty of secrecy as other board members. Holding positions on the\nboard may provide access to additional information, however, and a number of\ntrade unions have sought the right to have workers\u2019 representatives on boards.\nIt is a phenomenon now seen in Eastern and Western Europe and North America,\nbut remains rather rare elsewhere.\n\nAnother expression of workers\u2019 participation is as owners of shares in limited\nliability companies or corporations. Sometimes workers are able to scrape\nenough capital together to purchase a firm that would otherwise be going out\nof business. The rationale behind these situations is that a worker who\nidentifies financially with a company will work harder for its success.\nImportant variables are the form of participation (return on investment rights\nor control rights), its degree (amount and timing of returns) and the reasons\nbehind financial participation. In any event, these practices are largely\nreserved to Europe and North America. If cooperative ventures are considered\npart of this phenomenon, however, the notion of workers being stakeholders in\ntheir work is much more widespread throughout the world. It would be\ninteresting to study whether and to what extent employee ownership of a firm\nor of shares in it has an effect on the workplace safety and health record.\n\n### Health and Safety Committees and Representatives\n\nA specialized form of workers\u2019 participation is seen in the development of\nhealth and safety committees and health and safety representatives (for worker\nparticipation in Denmark, see Box). The legislation of a number of countries\nprovides for the establishment of such committees and for such representatives\n(e.g., Belgium, several provinces of Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,\nSweden). Smaller companies, variously defined, are usually excluded from such\nmandatory measures, but they, like larger units, often set up health and\nsafety committees on their own initiative. In addition, many collective\nbargaining agreements have led to the creation of such committees and to the\ndesignation of health and safety representatives (e.g., in Canada and the\nUnited States).\n\n#### Denmark: Worker Participation in Health and Safety\n\nDanish industrial relations provide an example of a country with a number of\ninstitutions that play a role in relation to health and safety. The main\nfeatures are:\n\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING: Negotiation of agreements by which trade unions and\nemployers fix wages, conditions of work, etc. Pertinent highlights are:\n\nShop stewards who are elected by workers under collective bargaining\nagreements; enjoy statutory protection against dismissal; serve as channel\nbetween workers and management on working conditions.\n\nCollective Agreement on Cooperation and Cooperation Committees provides for\ninformation to be given to individuals and groups of workers in advance so\nthey can make their views known before a decision is taken and for the\nestablishment of cooperation committees.\n\nCooperation committees must be set up in all firms employing more than 35\nworkers (25 in the public service). Joint committees to promote cooperation in\nday-to-day operations; they must be consulted on the introduction of new\ntechnologies and the organization of production; some co-determination rights\non working conditions, training and personal data.\n\nNational collective agreement on industrial disputes (of 1910) gives workers a\nright (rarely exercised) to stop work if considerations of \u201clife, welfare or\nhonour\u201d make this absolutely necessary. Other collective agreements contain\nprovisions on training and trade unions also provide it.\n\nFRAMEWORK LAW: The Working Environment Act creates \u201cthe basis on which the\nundertakings themselves will be able to solve questions relating to safety and\nhealth under the guidance of the employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and\nunder the guidance and supervision of the Labour Inspection Service\u201d (Sec.\n1(b)). The Act establishes a complete system from the plant to the national\nlevel to permit worker participation:\n\nSafety representatives are elected representatives required in firms employing\nat least ten workers; they enjoy the same protection against dismissal and\nretaliation as shop stewards and are entitled to reimbursement of official\nexpenses.\n\nSafety groups: The safety representative and the department supervisor form\nthe safety group. Its functions are to:\n\n\u00b7 monitor working conditions\n\n\u00b7 inspect equipment, tools, materials\n\n\u00b7 report any risk which cannot be avoided immediately\n\n\u00b7 halt production where necessary to avert an imminent serious danger\n\n\u00b7 ensure that work is performed safely and proper instructions are given\n\n\u00b7 investigate industrial accidents and occupational diseases\n\n\u00b7 participate in prevention activities\n\n\u00b7 cooperate with the occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 act as link between workers and the safety committee.\n\nMembers of the safety group are entitled to training and to necessary\ninformation.\n\nSafety Committees are required in firms employing at least 20 workers. In\nfirms with more than two safety groups, the safety committees consist of\nworkers elected from among safety representatives, two supervisor members and\nan employer\u2019s representative.\n\nThe functions are:\n\n\u00b7 planning, directing and coordinating health and safety activities\n\n\u00b7 being consulted on these matters\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with other companies engaged in work at the same workplace\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with the company\u2019s occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 supervising the activity of safety groups\n\n\u00b7 making recommendations on prevention of accidents and diseases.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL involves employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations in\nthe definition and application of preventive policy at the national level.\nComposition: 11 representatives of employee organizations representing manual\nand non-manual workers, one for supervisors, ten of employers\u2019 organizations,\nplus an occupational medical practitioner, a technical expert and non-voting\ngovernmental representatives. Functions:\n\n\u00b7 is consulted on drafting legislation and regulations\n\n\u00b7 may on its own initiative take up a health and safety matter\n\n\u00b7 submits annual recommendations on working environment policy\n\n\u00b7 coordinates the activities of Trade Safety Councils\n\n\u00b7 supervises the activity of the Working Environment Fund.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT FUND is managed by a tripartite board. The Fund has mainly\ninformation and training duties, but also finances research programmes.\n\nTRADE SAFETY COUNCILS: Twelve Trade Safety Councils examine the problems of\ntheir trade or industry and advise undertakings. They are also consulted on\ndraft legislation. Equal representation of employers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019\norganizations on the one hand and workers\u2019 organizations on the other hand.\n\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES: In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Labour\nInspection Service and within it, the Danish Institute of the Working\nEnvironment, provide various types of services and advice in the field of\noccupational safety and health. Collective industrial disputes are heard by\nthe Labour Courts.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Vogel 1994).  \n  \n---  \n  \nOften, collective bargaining agreements will strengthen the legislatively\nguaranteed powers afforded to workers\u2019 safety and health representatives. The\ncommittees and representatives vary in regard to their relationship to trade\nunions and works councils, their election or appointment, their duties and\nfunctions and their impact. As a form of workers\u2019 involvement in the\nspecialized sphere of health and safety, such committees and representatives\ncan be a contributing factor to improving both working conditions and the\nlabour relations climate. They have been most successful when they form an\nintegral part of management\u2019s safety and health programme, have access to\nadequate information, involve rank-and-file workers in their activities to\nhelp ensure continuity and are backed up by effective government labour\ninspection. Where employers maintain occupational health services or have\nsafety experts, a fruitful relationship with them can also promote the success\nof joint health and safety committees. A recent workplace survey in the United\nKingdom, for instance, found that \u201cjoint consultative committees, with all\nemployee representatives appointed by unions, significantly reduced workplace\ninjuries relative to those establishments where the management alone\ndetermines health and safety arrangements\u201d (Reilly, Paci and Holl 1995). They\nalso reported an important role for joint consultative committees where\nemployee representatives were appointed in other ways. However, some research\nalso indicates that joint health and safety committees fall short of the\nexpectations held out for them. The reasons suggested for this differ:\ninsufficient support from management, participants who are not adequately\ninformed or trained, workers not represented forcefully enough and so on.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives may be appointed by management (as\nin many workplaces where no trade union is present), designated by the trade\nunion (as in the United Kingdom) or elected directly by the workers at the\nenterprise or higher level (as in Denmark). A parallel system will be used for\nworker representatives on a joint labour-management health and safety\ncommittee which, while bipartite, will not always have equal representation\nfrom both sides. General institutions for workers\u2019 representation are often\ncomplemented by special representative structures for health and safety (as in\nSpain).\n\nThe mechanism chosen will often reflect the existence of other labour\nrelations institutions in a country: in France, for instance, employee members\nof the joint health, safety and working conditions committees are appointed by\na delegate elected from the works committee and staff representatives; in\nGermany, members designated by the works council will be among those serving\non a joint health and safety committee. Works councils in the Netherlands may\ndelegate their powers to a safety, health and welfare committee. A strong\nlink, if not identity, between trade union representatives and health and\nsafety representatives is usually seen as desirable (as in Quebec (Canada),\nIreland, Norway and Sweden), but where trade union density is low this runs\nthe risk of depriving large numbers of workers of representation rights in\nrelation to health and safety. Speculation that joint health and safety\ncommittees might lead to extending greater workers\u2019 participation to other\nfields has remained largely unfounded.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives normally have the following rights:\nto have access to information on health and safety and the introduction of new\ntechnology, to be consulted on these matters, to be involved in monitoring\nworkplace conditions, to accompany inspectors (sometimes called the\n\u201cwalkaround right\u201d), to be involved in accident investigations and to make\nrecommendations to management on the improvement of working conditions. In\nsome countries their powers go beyond this to include the right to engage in\nco-decision making, to initiate inspections and accident investigations and to\nreview management\u2019s reports to government. Most importantly, some workers\u2019\nhealth and safety representatives are empowered to order the shut-down of an\nimminently hazardous operation (also called \u201cred-tagging\u201d, for the marker\nplaced on the spot), as in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. They are in\ncertain instances, such as in France and some provinces of Canada, directly\ninvolved in the enforcement of health and safety regulations. Prior\nconsultation of the joint committee is sometimes necessary before an employer\ncan make any significant change in health, safety or working conditions (as in\nFrance and the Netherlands). In Belgium intercompany health services are under\nthe control of a joint committee. In Italy the committees\u2019 role includes the\npromotion of prevention, and in Greece they can, with the employers\u2019\nagreement, call for expert opinions on health and safety questions.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives necessarily enjoy protection from\ndiscrimination or retaliation in the exercise of their functions. They are\nentitled to at least some time off with pay, as well as to have the necessary\nmeans (the definition of which is often debated) to exercise their functions.\nIn addition, while in office some are specially shielded from economic layoffs\n(redundancies) or given extra protection from dismissal (as in Belgium).\nFrequently, worker health and safety representatives have a right to receive\nspecialized training (as in Denmark).\n\nThe effect that workers\u2019 health and safety representatives and joint\ncommittees can have will of course depend not only on rights and duties set\nout in legislation or in a collective bargaining agreement, but on how they\nare exercised in practice. This is in turn influenced by factors that affect\nworkers\u2019 participation generally. Such representatives and joint committees\nare no substitute for the effective government enforcement of health and\nsafety standards or for what may be achieved by means of collective\nbargaining. However, \u201cmost observers believe that (mandated joint health and\nsafety) committees provide a more efficient regulatory regime for safety and\nhealth than inspectorate or civil liability schemes\u201d (Kaufman and Kleiner\n1993). In any event, the trend is definitely towards greater workers\u2019\nparticipation in health and safety matters, at least in terms of collective\nagreements covering larger enterprises and legislation. Where they operate as\neffective institutions, joint health and safety committees can be a valuable\ntool for identifying problems and raising awareness of hazards, thus\npotentially reducing the incidence of injury, disease and death on the job.\nThe extent to which they are effective, however, depends on a large range of\nvariables in the particular labour relations system and in the strategic\napproach taken to health and safety at the workplace.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSchregle (1994) has commented:\n\nIn practice, none of these workers\u2019 participation schemes has produced the\nexpected results. There are many reasons for this. One is that, in a general\nway, trade unions and employers do not have the same view of participation.\nWhile it is the workers\u2019 desire to exert a tangible and concrete influence on\nemployers\u2019 decisions in the sense of power-sharing, employers insist on\nmanagement rights or management prerogatives, derived from private ownership,\nto run the business according to their own criteria and decision-making power,\naffording to workers at most the right to express their views and positions\nwithout binding effect on management. The result of all this is confusion over\nsuch terms as consultation, workers\u2019 participation, workers\u2019 participation in\nmanagement, co-determination, co-management, etc.\n\nThe fact remains that in most workplaces around the world, there is little\neffective employee participation at the enterprise level. The first level of\nparticipation and indeed a prerequisite for it, is the provision of\ninformation, followed by consultation. Within Europe, research has indicated a\nwide variation in the extent of implementation of the 1989 framework directive\non health and safety, when it comes to workers\u2019 participation; it may get a\nnew lease on life with the impetus of the 1995 directive on European works\ncouncils. A high degree of non-participation also characterizes other regions.\nNevertheless, high hopes continue to be held out for strengthening mechanisms\nfor workers\u2019 participation at the enterprise level.\n\nThe traditional approach to workers\u2019 participation as promotional of greater\nworker-management cooperation falls short of being satisfactory in relation to\nhealth and safety issues, where the categorization of labour relations as\nconflictual or cooperative does not particularly advance the debate. As Vogel\n(1994) notes:\n\n...the problem of worker participation is clearly not confined to the\ninstitutionalized forms of participation in or outside the undertaking. The\nbasis of participation lies in the recognition that distinct interests are in\nplay giving rise to specific rationales... The essential legitimacy of\nparticipation is to be found outside the firm in a democratic requirement\nwhich refuses to admit that the self-determination of individuals should be\nconfined within the rules of political representation and in a view of health\nconceived as a purposeful, social process through which individuals and\ncommunities develop strategies for self-fulfilment and defence.\n\nIn the end, the differing functions of various workers\u2019 participation schemes\nmake it difficult to assess their comparative impact. As collective bargaining\nshrinks in coverage, however, greater use of management-led workers\u2019\nparticipation arrangements may be expected.\n\n## CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nMarco Biagi\n\n### Worker Participation in Health and Safety Matters\n\nWorker participation in safety organization in plants can be planned in many\nways, depending on national law and practice. This article refers only to\nconsultation and information arrangements, not related forms of employee\ninvolvement. Additional coverage of specific aspects somewhat linked with\nconsultation and information (e.g., participation in or initiation of\ninspections, participation in training activities) is offered elsewhere in\nthis chapter.\n\nThe idea of employers and employees working jointly to improve health and\nsafety at work is based on several principles:\n\n1\\. Workers can contribute to prevention of industrial accidents by spotting\nand warning about potential hazards and giving notice of imminent dangers.\n\n2\\. Involving employees educates and motivates them to cooperate in the\npromotion of safety.\n\n3\\. Ideas and experiences of workers are regarded as a useful contribution to\nsafety improvement.\n\n4\\. People have a right to be involved in decisions that affect their working\nlife, particularly their health and well-being.\n\n5\\. Cooperation between the two sides of industry, essential to improve\nworking conditions, should be based on an equal partnership.\n\nThese principles have been laid down in the ILO Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155). Article 20 provides that \u201cco-operation between\nmanagement and workers and/or their representatives within the undertaking\nshall be an essential element of organizational and other measures\u201d in the\narea of occupational health and safety. Also the ILO Communications within the\nUndertaking Recommendation, 1967 (No. 129), Paragraph 2(1), underlines that:\n\n...employers and their organizations as well as workers and their\norganizations should, in their common interest, recognise the importance of a\nclimate of mutual understanding and confidence within undertakings that is\nfavourable both to the efficiency of the undertaking and to the aspirations of\nthe workers.\n\nThe underlying philosophy is that employers and employees have a common\ninterest in a self-regulating system in industrial accident prevention;\nactually they are more interested in occupational safety than in occupational\nhealth, since the occupational origin of accidents is more simple to establish\nand they are thus compensated more easily. Also for this reason safety\nrepresentatives in many countries were historically the first employee\nrepresentatives at the workplace to have their rights and duties determined by\nlaw or collective agreements. Today there is probably no subject in labour\nrelations and human resources management on which the social partners are so\nready to collaborate as in health and safety matters. But in some national\ncontexts trade unions have not put sufficient resources into the safety and\nhealth effort to make it a major issue in either negotiations or contract\nadministration.\n\n### Information and Consultation Rights in Legislation in ILO and European\nUnion.\n\nThe general obligation for employers to disclose information in health and\nsafety matters to workers and/or their representatives and seek their opinion\nvia consultative arrangements is provided by Article 20 of the ILO Prevention\nof Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174). This norm prescribes\nthat \u201cthe workers and their representatives at a major hazard installation\nshall be consulted through appropriate cooperative mechanisms in order to\nensure a safe system of work\u201d. More specifically workers and their\nrepresentatives have the right to:\n\n(a) be adequately and suitably informed of the hazards associated with the\nmajor hazard installation and their likely consequences; (b) be informed of\nany orders, instructions or recommendations made by the competent authority;\n(c) be consulted in the preparation of and have access to, the following\ndocuments: (i) safety reports, (ii) emergency plans and procedures, (iii)\naccident reports.\n\nAs a consequence of these information and consultation rights, workers are\nentitled \u201cto discuss with the employer any potential hazards they consider\ncapable of generating a major accident\u201d (Article 20(f)).\n\nMore generally ILO Convention No. 155 lays down rules concerning occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment, providing for effective\narrangements at the level of the undertaking (be they regulated by law or\ncollective bargaining or even left to local/domestic practices) under which\n\u201c(c) representatives of workers... are given adequate information on measures\ntaken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and may consult\ntheir representative organizations about such information provided they do not\ndisclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article 19). The same norm adds that under these\narrangements workers or their representatives must be \u201cenabled to enquire into\nand are consulted by the employer, on all aspects of occupational safety and\nhealth associated with their work\u201d. And for this purpose \u201ctechnical advisers\nmay, by mutual agreement, be brought in from outside the undertaking\u201d.\n\nILO Recommendation No. 164 supplementing Convention No. 155 (Paragraph 12)\nclarifies that information and consultation rights on safety and health\nmatters should be granted to a variety of participatory institutions: workers\u2019\nsafety delegates, workers\u2019 safety and health committees, joint safety and\nhealth committees and other workers\u2019 representatives. This text also states\nimportant principles affecting the nature and the content of\ninformation/consultation. These practices should first of all enable the\nabove-mentioned specialized forms of workers\u2019 representation \u201cto contribute in\nthe decision-making process at the level of the undertaking regarding matters\nof safety and health\u201d (Article 12(e)).\n\nThese are not simply rights to know and to be heard: workers and their\nrepresentatives should \u201c(a) be given adequate information on safety and health\nmatters, enabled to examine factors affecting safety and health and encouraged\nto propose measures on the subject\u201d. They should also \u201c(b) be consulted when\nmajor new safety and health measures are envisaged and before they are carried\nout and seek to obtain the support of the workers for such measures\u201d and\n\u201c(c)... in planning alterations to work processes, work content or\norganization of work, which may have safety or health implications for the\nworkers\u201d.\n\nThe principle under which \u201crepresentatives of the workers... should be\ninformed and consulted in advance by the employer on projects, measures and\ndecisions which are liable to have harmful consequences on the health of\nworkers\u201d (ILO Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration)\nRecommendation, 1977 (No. 156), Paragraph 21) reflects the idea of an\n\u201ceffective policy of communication\u201d stated in general terms by Paragraph 3 of\nILO Recommendation No. 129, which prescribes that \u201cinformation is given and\nthat consultation takes place between the parties concerned before decisions\non matters of major interest are taken by management\u201d. And in order to make\nthese practices effective, \u201csteps should be taken to train those concerned in\nthe use of communications methods\u201d (Para. 6).\n\nThe participative approach in labour relations in the area of health and\nsafety is confirmed by other international legal texts. A meaningful example\nin this respect is offered by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the\nintroduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of\npeople working in countries of the European Union. Article 10 provides for the\nemployer an obligation to take appropriate measures so that workers and/or\ntheir representatives receive, in accordance with national law and/or\npractices, all necessary information\u201d concerning safety and health risks,\nprotective and preventive measures (also for first aid, fire-fighting and\nevacuation of workers and in case of serious and imminent danger). This\ninformation has to be \u201cprovided in a suitable form to temporary workers and\nhired workers present in the establishment or enterprise\u201d. Additionally\n\u201cworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of\nworkers, or workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the\nsafety and health of workers\u201d must have access to risk assessment and\nprotective measures, reports on occupational accidents and illnesses suffered\nby workers and all information yielded by protective and preventive measures,\ninspection agencies and bodies responsible for safety and health.\n\nArticle 11 of the EC Directive links consultation and participation. In fact\nemployers are under the obligation to \u201cconsult workers and/or their\nrepresentatives and allow them to take part in discussions on all questions\nrelating to safety and health at work\u201d. That presupposes \u201cthe consultation of\nworkers, the right of workers and/or their representatives to make proposals\n(and) balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or\npractices\u201d. The document continues, prescribing that:\n\nworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of workers\nor workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the safety and\nhealth of workers shall participate in a balanced way, in accordance with\nnational laws and/or practices, or be consulted in advance and in due time by\nthe employer...\n\nThe objective of these rights is to cover all measures which may substantially\naffect health and safety, including the designation of employees required to\nimplement certain measures (first-aid, fire-fighting and evacuation of\nworkers) and the planning and organization of adequate health and safety\ntraining throughout the employment relationship (upon hiring, job transfer,\nintroduction of new working equipment, introduction of any new technology).\n\nThe choice is clear: no to conflict, yes to participation in health and safety\nlabour relations. This is the meaning of the EC Framework Directive, which\ngoes beyond the simple logic of the right to information. The system is based\non a genuine form of consultation, since it must take place \u201cin advance and in\ngood time\u201d \u2013 in other words, not only prior to decisions being adopted by the\nemployer but also soon enough for proposals and comments to be made about\nthem.\n\nThe Directive also uses the ambiguous expression \u201cbalanced participation\u201d, a\nformula open to various interpretations. The notion is broader than (or, at\nleast, different from) that of consultation, but not to the extent of\nconstituting a form of joint decision making, which would prevent employers\nfrom taking measures which had not been approved by the workers or their\nrepresentatives. It seems quite clearly to be a form of participation going\nbeyond mere consultation (otherwise the article heading \u201cconsultation and\nparticipation\u201d would be nonsense) but not necessarily as far as joint decision\nmaking. The concept is left somewhat vague: it embraces a range of multiple\nforms of worker participation which vary considerably between Member States of\nthe European Union. And in any case the Directive does not place any\nobligation to provide a specific form of balanced participation.\n\nIn both the ILO and EC texts, information seems to be a concept whereby\nmanagement informs the employees\u2019 representatives body in writing or in a\nmeeting. Consultation means that normally joint committees are set up in which\nemployees\u2019 representatives are not merely informed by management, but can also\ncomment and expect justification from management in the event of differing\nopinions. Certainly these concepts differ from negotiation (when a\ncontractually binding outcome is worked out in joint negotiating committees at\ncompany or inter-company level) and co-determination (where the employee has a\nright of veto and decisions require the agreement of both parties).\n\nFor Community-scale undertakings and groups thereof, EU Council Directive No.\n94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 requires setting up European Works Council or an\ninformation and consultation procedure. The information relates \u201cin particular\nto transnational questions which significantly affect workers\u2019 interests\u201d\n(Article 6(3)). Time will tell if this is used for safety and health purposes.\n\n### Role of Workers\u2019 Representatives in Risk Assessment and Improvement of\nWork Environment: Record-keeping\n\nThe active nature of consultation is also stressed in Article 11(3) of the EC\nFramework Directive, which states that either workers with specific functions\nin this area or workers\u2019 representatives in general \u201cmay call on the employer\nto take appropriate measures and submit to him relevant proposals by means of\nwhich all risks to workers may be reduced and/or sources of danger\neliminated\u201d.\n\nThe Framework Directive, with its provisions on risk management, while placing\nclear responsibilities on employers, also favours the greater involvement of\nworkers and their representatives in consultations on management strategies in\nhealth and safety. Employers must assess risks and present their risk-control\nmanagement systems in a plan or statement. In all cases they are expected to\nconsult with and involve workers and/or their representatives in all the\ndesign, implementation and monitoring of these systems. But it is undeniable\nthat this Directive, by conferring relevant participative rights to workers,\nhas at the same time adopted an approach of \u201cself-assessment\u201d. Other EC\nDirectives require, among other things, the recording of the results of\nmeasurements and examinations and lay down the employees\u2019 rights of access to\nthese records.\n\nAlso ILO Recommendation No. 164 (Para. 15(2)) provides that:\n\n...employers should be required to keep such records relevant to occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment as are considered necessary by\nthe competent authority or authorities; these might include records of all\nnotifiable occupational accidents and injuries to health which arise in the\ncourse of or in connection with work, records of authorisation and exemptions\nunder laws or regulations in the field and any conditions to which they may be\nsubject, certificates relating to supervision of the health of workers in the\nundertaking and data concerning exposure to specified substances and agents.\n\nIt is a general principle worldwide that employers are required to keep\nrecords, for instance of accidents and occupational diseases, or on the use or\npresence of biological and environmental monitoring.\n\n### National Laws and Practices\n\nBy comparison, labour relations systems exist (e.g., Italy) where statutory\nlaw provides no specific right to information and consultation in occupational\nsafety and health for workers\u2019 representatives, although such a right is often\nincluded in collective agreements. Italian legislation gives the workers\nthemselves the right to control the implementation of standards relating to\nthe prevention of accidents and occupational diseases, as well as the right to\ndevelop studies and adopt adequate measures in order to safeguard health and\nsafety at work. In other systems (e.g., in the United Kingdom) in order to\nobtain disclosure of information on matters of health and safety as provided\nby law, it is necessary first to have safety representatives appointed; but\nthis is possible only if there is a recognized trade union in existence at the\nundertaking. In situations where the employer refuses or withdraws the\nnecessary status of a recognized trade union, information and consultation\nrights cannot be exercised.\n\nThese national experiences raise the question: To what extent is effective\nworkers\u2019 participation in health and safety conditional on the adoption of\nstatutory arrangements? Certainly some legal backing seems to be helpful, the\noptimum amount of legislation being probably at a point where it provides for\nthe election of workers\u2019 representatives with sufficiently strong rights to\nallow them to function independently of management, while at the same time\nleaving room for a certain variety in the organizational arrangements for\nparticipation in different sectors and corporations.\n\nIn general labour relations systems provide by law that workers\u2019\nrepresentatives are to be informed and consulted in health and safety matters.\nWhen joint committees composed of management and employee representatives are\nestablished, they enjoy considerable powers. For instance in France the\ncommittee for health, safety and working conditions may propose preventive\nmeasures: an employer declining to accept them must give detailed reasons. But\nempirical evidence demonstrates that sometimes safety representatives seem\nmore efficient than joint committees since they are less dependent on the\nexistence of a cooperative relationship.\n\nThrough various forms of representational participation, employees in general\nenjoy rights recognized by ILO Conventions and Recommendations (plus EC\ndirectives, when applicable) mentioned earlier with special reference to\nindustrialized free-market economies. Safety representatives and/or works\ncouncillors have a right to be informed and consulted by the employer on all\nissues relating to the company\u2019s operations and the improvement of working\nconditions, including health and safety matters. They have the right to see\nall relevant documents that the employer is statutorily obliged to keep and\nalso to see any statements on the subject and the results of any research.\nThey may also have copies of any of these documents if required.\n\n### Effectiveness of Information and Consultation Rights\n\nApart from specific aspects (such as use of experts, participation in or\ninitiation of inspections, protection from victimization) which strongly\naffect the effectiveness of information and consultation rights in health and\nsafety, there are general factors which have to be taken into account in this\nrespect. First, the size of the undertaking: the effectiveness of controls is\non the wane in small units, where trade unions and other forms of workers\u2019\nrepresentation are almost absent. Small-sized establishments are also least\nlikely to implement statutory requirements.\n\nSecondly, where safety representatives are integrated into the formal trade\nunion organization at the workplace, they are more likely to achieve the\nexpected improvements in the working environment. Thirdly, consultation and\ninformation arrangements in health and safety reflect the more conflictual\n(e.g., UK, Italy) or cooperative (e.g., Germany, Scandinavian countries,\nJapan) nature of the surrounding labour relations system. And in general,\ncollaboration between management and labour favours the disclosing of\ninformation and consultation.\n\nFourthly, the role of managerial initiative should not be underestimated. More\nthan the existence of statutory rights, consultation and information are\neffective when there is the presence of a managerial culture which supports\nthem. Employers\u2014by their attitude towards training, their commitment to\ndisclosing information and their speed in answering queries\u2014are able to create\nan adversarial or cooperative climate. Legal backing is essential to guarantee\nfull independence to worker representatives to act in this field, but then the\nsuccess of information/consultation arrangements depends largely on the\nvoluntary choice of both sides of industry.\n\nLastly it must be said that a precondition for successful worker\nrepresentation in health and safety at the workplace is public awareness. It\nis fundamental for this specialized form of employee involvement that such a\nneed is perceived and valued by people at work. There is empirical evidence\nthat workers identify health and safety as one of the most significant\nconcerns in their working life.\n\n### Safeguards on Use of Information\n\nComparative experience demonstrates that in general safety representatives are\nconsidered to be in breach of confidence if they reveal any information\nrelating to an employer\u2019s production processes and other professional secrets.\nFurthermore, they are obliged to use discretion with regard to any information\nprovided to them which the employer indicates is confidential. ILO Convention\nNo. 155 recognizes this by providing that enterprise-level representatives may\nconsult their representative organizations about occupational health and\nsafety information \u201cprovided they do not disclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article\n19(c)).\n\nIn some systems (e.g., Greece) employee representatives on works councils are\nobliged not to communicate to third parties information acquired which is of\nfundamental importance to the enterprise and which, if disclosed, would harm\nthe enterprise\u2019s competitiveness. The employee representatives and the\nemployer are supposed to decide jointly what information can be disclosed.\nUnder other systems (e.g., Luxembourg), where if employee representatives\ndisagree with an employer\u2019s classification of information as confidential,\nthey may refer the matter to the inspectorate for a decision.\n\nIn some countries the duty of confidentiality is only implicit (e.g., Italy).\nAlso when there is no specific requirement in this respect (e.g., United\nKingdom), employee representatives cannot receive from the employer\ninformation relating to the health of individuals (unless their consent is\ngiven), information that would damage national security or information that\nwould damage the employer\u2019s undertaking. Finally (e.g., Sweden) the duty to\nobserve confidentiality may not prevent safety representatives from passing on\nthe information received to the executive board of their trade union, which\nwill also be bound to observe confidentiality.\n\n## LABOUR RELATIONS ASPECTS OF TRAINING\nThe example of a safety performance management programme illustrates some\nhuman resource management theories in the context of occupational safety and\nhealth. As described by Reber, Wallin and Duhon (1993), this approach has had\nconsiderable success in reducing lost time on account of accidents. It relies\non specifying safe and unsafe behaviours, teaching employees how to recognize\nsafe behaviour and motivating them to follow the safety rules with goal\nsetting and feedback. The programme relies heavily on a training technique\nwhereby employees are shown safe, correct methods via videotapes or live\nmodels. They then have a chance to practice new behaviours and are provided\nwith frequent performance feedback. In addition, some companies offer tangible\nprizes and rewards for engaging in safe behaviour (rather than simply for\nhaving fewer accidents). Employee consultation is an important feature of the\nprogramme as well.\nThe implications of human resources management for industrial relations\npractices remain a source of some controversy. This is particularly the case\nfor types of workers\u2019 participation schemes that are perceived by trade unions\nas a threat. In some instances human resources management strategies are\npursued alongside collective bargaining; in other cases the human resources\nmanagement approach seeks to supplant or prevent the activities of independent\norganizations of workers in defence of their interests. Proponents of human\nresources management maintain that since the 1970s, the personnel management\nside of human resources management has evolved from being a maintenance\nfunction, secondary to the industrial relations function, to being one of\ncritical importance to the effectiveness of an organization (Ferris, Rosen and\nBarnum 1995). Since human resources management is a tool for management to\nemploy as part of its personnel policy rather than a relationship between an\nemployer and workers\u2019 chosen representatives, it is not the focus of this\nchapter.\nThe articles which follow describe the main parties in a labour relations\nsystem and the basic principles underpinning their interaction: rights to\nfreedom of association and representation. A natural corollary to freedom of\nassociation is the right to engage in collective bargaining, a phenomenon\nwhich must be distinguished from consultative and non-union worker\nparticipation arrangements. Collective bargaining takes place as negotiations\nbetween representatives chosen by the workers and those acting on behalf of\nthe employer; it leads to a mutually accepted, binding agreement that can\ncover a wide range of subjects.\nOther forms of workers\u2019 participation, national-level consultative bodies,\nworks councils and enterprise-level health and safety representatives are also\nimportant features of some labour relations systems and are thus examined in\nthis chapter. Consultation can take various forms and occur at different\nlevels, with national-, regional- and/or industrial- and enterprise-level\narrangements. Worker representatives in consultative bodies may or may not\nhave been selected by the workers and there is no obligation for the state or\nthe employer to follow the wishes of those representatives or to abide by the\nresults of the consultative process. In some countries, collective bargaining\nand consultative arrangements exist side by side and, to work properly, must\nbe carefully intermeshed. For both, rights to information about health and\nsafety and training are crucial. Finally, this chapter takes into account that\nin any labour relations system, disputes may arise, whether they are\nindividual or collective. Safety and health issues can lead to labour\nrelations strife, producing work stoppages. The chapter thus concludes with\ndescriptions of how labour relations disputes are resolved, including by\narbitration, mediation or resort to the regular or labour courts, preceded by\na discussion of the role of the labour inspectorate in the context of labour\nrelations.\nClassically, three actors have been identified as parties to the labour\nrelations system: the state, employers and workers\u2019 representatives. To this\npicture must now be added the forces that transcend these categories: regional\nand other multilateral economic integration arrangements among states and\nmultinational corporations as employers which do not have a national identity\nbut which also can be seen as labour market institutions. Since the impact of\nthese phenomena on labour relations remains unclear in many respects, however,\ndiscussion will focus on the more classic actors despite this caveat of the\nlimitation of such an analysis in an increasingly global community. In\naddition, greater emphasis is needed on analysing the role of the individual\nemployment relationship in labour relations systems and on the impact of the\nemerging alternative forms of work.\nThe state always has at least an indirect effect on all labour relations. As\nthe source of legislation, the state exerts an inevitable influence on the\nemergence and development of a labour relations system. Laws can hinder or\nfoster, directly or indirectly, the establishment of organizations\nrepresenting workers and employers. Legislation also sets a minimum level of\nworker protection and lays down \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d. To take an example,\nit can provide lesser or greater protection for a worker who refuses to\nperform work he or she reasonably considers to be too hazardous, or for one\nwho acts as a health and safety representative.\nThrough the development of its labour administration, the state also has an\nimpact on how a labour relations system may function. If effective enforcement\nof the law is afforded through a labour inspectorate, collective bargaining\ncan pick up where the law leaves off. If, however, the state infrastructure\nfor having rights vindicated or for assisting in the resolution of disputes\nthat emerge between employers and workers is weak, they will be left more to\ntheir own devices to develop alternative institutions or arrangements.\nThe extent to which the state has built up a well-functioning court or other\ndispute resolution system may also have an influence on the course of labour\nrelations. The ease with which workers, employers and their respective\norganizations may enforce their legal rights can be as important as the rights\nthemselves. Thus the decision by a government to set up special tribunals or\nadministrative bodies to deal with labour disputes and/or disagreements over\nindividual employment problems can be an expression of the priority given to\nsuch issues in that society.\nIn many countries, the state has a direct role to play in labour relations. In\ncountries that do not respect freedom of association principles, this may\ninvolve outright control of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations or\ninterference with their activities. The state may attempt to invalidate\ncollective bargaining agreements that it perceives as interfering with its\neconomic policy goals. Generally speaking, however, the role of the state in\nindustrialized countries has tended to promote orderly industrial relations by\nproviding the necessary legislative framework, including minimum levels of\nworker protection and offering parties information, advice and dispute\nsettlement services. This could take the form of mere toleration of labour\nrelations institutions and the actors in them; it could move beyond to\nactively encourage such institutions. In a few countries, the state is a more\nactive participant in the industrial relations system, which includes national\nlevel tripartite negotiations. For decades in Belgium and more recently in\nIreland, for instance, government representatives have been sitting down\nalongside those from employer and trade union circles to hammer out a national\nlevel agreement or pact on a wide range of labour and social issues.\nTripartite machinery to fix minimum wages has long been a feature of labour\nrelations in Argentina and Mexico, for example. The interest of the state in\ndoing so derives from its desires to move the national economy in a certain\ndirection and to maintain social peace for the duration of the pact; such\nbipartite or tripartite arrangements create what has been called a \u201csocial\ndialogue\u201d, as it has developed in Australia (until 1994), Austria, Belgium,\nIreland and the Netherlands, for instance. The pros and cons of what have been\ntermed \u201ccorporatist\u201d or \u201cneocorporatist\u201d approaches to labour relations have\nbeen extensively debated over the years. With its tripartite structure, the\nInternational Labour Organization has long been a proponent of strong\ntripartite cooperation in which the \u201csocial partners\u201d play a significant role\nin shaping government policy on a wide range of issues.\nIn some countries, the very idea of the state becoming involved as a\nnegotiator in private sector bargaining is unthinkable, as in Germany or the\nUnited States. In such systems, the role of the state is, aside from its\nlegislative function, generally restricted to providing assistance to the\nparties in reaching an agreement, such as in offering voluntary mediation\nservices. Whether active or passive, however, the state is a constant partner\nin any labour relations system. In addition, where the state is itself the\nemployer, or an enterprise is publicly owned, it is of course directly\ninvolved in labour relations with the employees and their representatives. In\nthis context, the state is motivated by its role as provider of public\nservices and/or as an economic actor.\nFinally, the impact of regional economic integration arrangements on state\npolicy is also felt in the labour relations field. Within the European Union,\npractice in member countries has changed to reflect directives dealing with\nconsultation of workers and their representatives, including those on health\nand safety matters in particular. Multilateral trade agreements, such as the\nlabour side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Canada,\nMexico, United States) or the agreements implementing the Mercosur Common\nMarket (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, thought soon to be joined by\nBolivia and Chile) also sometimes contain workers\u2019 rights provisions or\nmechanisms that over time may have an indirect impact on labour relations\nsystems of the participating states.\nEmployers\u2013that is, providers of work\u2013are usually differentiated in industrial\nrelations systems depending upon whether they are in the private or the public\nsector. Historically, trade unionism and collective bargaining developed first\nin the private sector, but in recent years these phenomena have spread to many\npublic sector settings as well. The position of state-owned enterprises\u2014which\nin any event are dwindling in number around the world\u2014as employers, varies\ndepending upon the country. (They still play a key role in China, India, Viet\nNam and in many African countries.) In Eastern and Central Europe, one of the\nmajor challenges of the post-Communist era has been the establishment of\nindependent organizations of employers.\nThe IOE\u2019s main activity, however, is to organize employers whenever they have\nto deal with social and labour matters at the global level. In practice, most\nof this takes place in the ILO, which has responsibility for these questions\nin the United Nations system. The IOE also has Category I consultative status\nwith the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, where it\nintervenes whenever matters of interest or consequence to employers arise.\nThe IOE is one of only two organizations that the employer community has set\nup to represent the interests of enterprise globally. The other is the\nInternational Chamber of Commerce, with its headquarters in Paris, which\nconcerns itself principally with economic matters. While structurally quite\ndifferent, the two organizations complement each other. They cooperate on the\nbasis of an agreement which defines their areas of responsibility as well as\nthrough good personal relations between their representatives and, to a\ndegree, on a common membership base. Many subjects cut across their mandates,\nof course, but are dealt with pragmatically without friction. On certain\nissues, such as multinational enterprises, the two organizations even act in\nunison.\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from: ILO 1994)\nIn the private sector, the situation has been summed up as follows:\nEmployers have common interests to defend and precise causes to advance. In\norganizing themselves, they pursue several aims which in turn determine the\ncharacter of their organizations. These can be chambers of commerce, economic\nfederations and employers\u2019 organizations (for social and labour matters) ...\nWhere issues centre essentially on social matters and industrial relations,\nincluding collective bargaining, occupational health and safety, human\nresource development, labour law and wages, the desire for co-ordinated action\nhas led to the creation of employers\u2019 organizations, which are always\nvoluntary in nature ... (ILO 1994a).\nSome employers\u2019 organizations were initially established in response to\npressure from the trade unions to negotiate, but others may be traced to\nmedieval guilds or other groups founded to defend particular market interests.\nEmployers\u2019 organizations have been described as formal groups of employers set\nup to defend, represent and advise affiliated employers and to strengthen\ntheir position in society at large with respect to labour matters as distinct\nfrom economic matters ... Unlike trade unions, which are composed of\nindividual persons, employers\u2019 organizations are composed of enterprises\n(Oechslin 1995).\nAs identified by Oechslin, there tend to be three main functions (to some\nextent overlapping) common to all employers\u2019 organizations: defence and\npromotion of their members\u2019 interests, representation in the political\nstructure and provision of services to their members. The first function is\nreflected largely in lobbying government to adopt policies that are friendly\nto employers\u2019 interests and in influencing public opinion, chiefly through\nmedia campaigns. The representative function may occur in the political\nstructure or in industrial relations institutions. Political representation is\nfound in systems where consultation of interested economic groups is foreseen\nby law (e.g., Switzerland), where economic and social councils provide for\nemployer representation (e.g., France, French-speaking African countries and\nthe Netherlands) and where there is participation in tripartite forums such as\nthe International Labour Conference and other aspects of ILO activity. In\naddition, employers\u2019 organizations can exercise considerable influence at the\nregional level (especially within the European Union).\nThe way in which the representative function in the industrial relations\nsystem occurs depends very much on the level at which collective bargaining\ntakes place in a particular country. This factor also largely determines the\nstructure of an employers\u2019 organization. If bargaining is centralized at the\nnational level, the employers\u2019 organization will reflect that in its internal\nstructure and operations (central economic and statistical data bank, creation\nof a mutual strike insurance system, strong sense of member discipline, etc.).\nEven in countries where bargaining takes place at the enterprise level (such\nas Japan or the United States), the employers\u2019 organization can offer its\nmembers information, guidelines and advice. Bargaining that takes place at the\nindustrial level (as in Germany, where, however, some employers have recently\nbroken ranks with their associations) or at multiple levels (as in France or\nItaly) of course also influences the structure of employers\u2019 organizations.\nAs for the third function, Oechslin notes, \u201cit is not always easy to draw a\nline between activities supporting the functions described above and those\nundertaken for the members in their interest\u201d (p. 42). Research is the prime\nexample, since it can be used for multiple purposes. Safety and health is an\narea in which data and information can be usefully shared by employers across\nsectors. Often, new concepts or reactions to novel developments in the world\nof work have been the product of broad reflection within employers\u2019\norganizations. These groups also provide training to members on a wide range\nof management issues and have undertaken social affairs action, such as in the\ndevelopment of workers\u2019 housing or support for community activities. In some\ncountries, employers\u2019 organizations provide assistance to their members in\nlabour court cases.\nThe structure of employers\u2019 organizations will depend not only on the level at\nwhich bargaining is done, but also on the country\u2019s size, political system and\nsometimes religious traditions. In developing countries, the main challenge\nhas been the integration of a very heterogeneous membership that may include\nsmall and medium-sized businesses, state enterprises and subsidiaries of\nmultinational corporations. The strength of an employers\u2019 organi-zation is\nreflected in the resources its members are willing to devote to it, whether in\nthe form of dues and contributions or in terms of their expertise and time.\nThe size of an enterprise is a major determinant in its approach to labour\nrelations, with the employer of a small workforce being more likely to rely on\ninformal means for dealing with its workers. Small and medium-sized\nenterprises, which are variously defined, sometimes fall under the threshold\nfor legally mandated workers\u2019 participation schemes. Where collective\nbargaining occurs at the enterprise level, it is much more likely to exist in\nlarge firms; where it takes place at the industry or national level, it is\nmore likely to have an effect in areas where large firms have historically\ndominated the private sector market.\nAs interest organizations, employers\u2019 organizations\u2014like trade unions\u2014have\ntheir own problems in the areas of leadership, internal decision-making and\nmember participation. Since employers tend to be individualists, however, the\nchallenge of marshalling discipline among the membership is even greater for\nemployers\u2019 organizations. As van Waarden notes (1995), \u201cemployers\u2019\nassociations generally have high density ratios ... However, employers find it\na much greater sacrifice to comply with the decisions and regulations of their\nassociations, as these reduce their much cherished freedom of enterprise.\u201d\nTrends in the structure of employers\u2019 organizations very much reflect those of\nthe labour market\u2013 towards or against centralization, in favour of or opposed\nto regulation of competition. Van Waarden continues: \u201ceven if the pressure to\nbecome more flexible in the \u2018post-Fordist\u2019 era continues, it does not\nnecessarily make employers\u2019 associations redundant or less influential ...\n(They) would still play an important role, namely as a forum for the\ncoordination of labour market policies behind the scenes and as an advisor for\nfirms or branch associations engaged in collective bargaining\u201d (ibid., p.\n104). They can also perform a solidarity function; through employers\u2019\nassociations, small employers may have access to legal or advisory services\nthey otherwise could not afford.\nPublic employers have come to see themselves as such only relatively recently.\nInitially, the government took the position that a worker\u2019s involvement in\ntrade union activity was incompatible with service to the sovereign state.\nThey later resisted calls to engage in collective bargaining with the argument\nthat the legislature, not the public administration, was the paymaster and\nthat it was thus impossible for the administration to enter into an agreement.\nThese arguments, however, did not prevent (often unlawful) public sector\nstrikes in many countries and they have fallen by the wayside. In 1978, the\nInternational Labour Conference adopted the Labour Relations (Public Service)\nConvention (No. 151) and Recommendation (No. 159) on public employees\u2019 right\nto organize and on procedures for determining their terms and conditions of\nemployment. Collective bargaining in the public sector is now a way of life in\nmany developed countries (e.g., Australia, France, United Kingdom) as well as\nin some developing countries (e.g., many francophone African countries and\nmany countries in Latin America).\nThe level of employer representation in the public sector depends largely upon\nthe political system of the country. In some this is a centralized function\n(as in France) whereas in others it reflects the various divisions of\ngovernment (as in the United States, where bargaining can take place at the\nfederal, state and municipal levels). Germany presents an interesting case in\nwhich the thousands of local communities have banded together to have a single\nbargaining agent deal with the unions in the public sector throughout the\ncountry.\nBecause public sector employers are already part of the state, they do not\nfall under laws requiring registration of employers\u2019 organizations. The\ndesignation of the bargaining agent in the public sector varies considerably\nby country; it may be the Public Service Commission, the Ministry of Labour,\nthe Ministry of Finance or another entity altogether. The positions taken by a\npublic employer in dealing with employees in this sector tend to follow the\npolitical orientation of the ruling political party. This may range from\ntaking a particular stance in bargaining to a flat-out denial of the right of\npublic employees to organize into trade unions. However, while as an employer\nthe public service is shrinking in many countries, there is an increasing\nreadiness on its part to engage in bargaining and consultations with employee\nrepresentatives.\nThe classic definition of a trade union is \u201ca continuous association of wage\nearners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their\nemployment\u201d (Webb and Webb 1920). The origins of trade unions go back as far\nas the first attempts to organize collective action at the beginning of the\nindustrial revolution. In the modern sense, however, trade unions arose in the\nlater part of the nineteenth century, when governments first began to concede\nthe unions\u2019 legal right to exist (previously, they had been seen as illegal\ncombinations interfering with freedom of commerce, or as outlawed political\ngroups). Trade unions reflect the conviction that only by banding together can\nworkers improve their situation. Trade union rights were born out of economic\nand political struggle which saw short-term individual sacrifice in the cause\nof longer-term collective gain. They have often played an important role in\nnational politics and have influenced developments in the world of work at the\nregional and international levels. Having suffered membership losses, however,\nin recent years in a number of countries (in North America and some parts of\nEurope), their role is under challenge in many quarters (see figure 21.2). The\npattern is mixed with areas of membership growth in the public service in many\ncountries around the world and with a new lease on life in places where trade\nunions were previously non-existent or active only under severe restrictions\n(e.g., Korea, the Philippines, some countries of Central and Eastern Europe).\nThe flourishing of democratic institutions goes hand in hand with the exercise\nof trade union freedoms, as the cases of Chile and Poland in the 1980s and\n1990s best illustrate. A process of internal reform and reorientation to\nattract greater and more diverse membership, particularly more women, can also\nbe seen within trade union circles in a number of countries. Only time will\ntell if these and other factors will be sufficient to deflect the\ncounterweighing tendencies towards the \u201cde-collectivization\u201d, also referred to\nas \u201catomization\u201d, of labour relations that has accompanied increased economic\nglobalization and ideological individualism.\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel02fe.gif)\n\nIn contemporary industrial relations systems, the functions fulfilled by trade\nunions are, like employers\u2019 organizations, basically the following: defence\nand promotion of the members\u2019 interests; political representation; and\nprovision of services to members. The flip side of trade unions\u2019\nrepresentative function is their control function: their legitimacy depends in\npart upon the ability to exert discipline over the membership, as for example\nin calling or ending a strike. The trade unions\u2019 constant challenge is to\nincrease their density, that is, the number of members as a percentage of the\nformal sector workforce. The members of trade unions are individuals; their\ndues, called contributions in some systems, support the union\u2019s activities.\n(Trade unions financed by employers, called \u201ccompany unions\u201d, or by\ngovernments as in formerly Communist countries, are not considered here, since\nonly independent organizations of workers are true trade unions.) Affiliation\nis generally a matter of an individual\u2019s voluntary decision, although some\nunions that have been able to win closed shop or union security arrangements\nare considered to be the representatives of all workers covered by a\nparticular collective bargaining agreement (i.e., in countries where trade\nunions are recognized as representatives of workers in a circumscribed\nbargaining unit). Trade unions may be affiliated to umbrella organizations at\nthe industrial, national, regional and international levels.\n\n#### International Labour Federations\n\nThe international labour movement on a global, as opposed to a regional or\nnational level, consists of international associations of national federations\nof labour unions. There are currently three such internationals, reflecting\ndifferent ideological tendencies: the International Confederation of Free\nTrade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the\nrelatively small, originally Christian, World Congress of Labour (WCL). The\nICFTU is the largest, with 174 affiliated unions from 124 countries in 1995,\nrepresenting 116 million trade union members. These groups lobby\nintergovernmental organizations on overall economic and social policy and\npress for worldwide protection of basic trade union rights. They can be\nthought of as the political force behind the international labour movement.\n\nThe industrial force of the international labour movement lies in the\ninternational associations of specific labour unions, usually drawn from one\ntrade, industry or economic sector. Known as International Trade Secretariats\n(ITSs) or Trade Union Internationals (TUIs), they may be independent,\naffiliated to, or controlled by the internationals. Coverage has traditionally\nbeen by sector, but also in some cases is by employee category (such as white-\ncollar workers), or by employer (public or private). For example, in 1995\nthere were 13 operative ITSs aligned with the ICFTU, distributed as follows:\nbuilding and woodworking; chemical and mining, energy; commercial, clerical,\nprofessional and technical; education; entertainment; food, agriculture,\nrestaurant and catering; graphic arts; journalism; metalworking; postal and\ntelecommunications; public service; textile, garment and leather work;\ntransport. The ITSs concentrate mainly on industry-specific issues, such as\nindustrial disputes and pay rates, but also the application of health and\nsafety provisions in a specific sector. They provide information, education,\ntraining and other services to affiliated unions. They also help coordinate\ninternational solidarity between unions in different countries, and represent\nthe interests of workers in various international and regional forums.\n\nSuch action is illustrated by the international trade union response to the\nincident at Bhopal, India, involving the leak of methyl isocyanate, which\nclaimed thousands of victims on 3 December 1984. At the request of their\nIndian national trade union affiliates, the ICFTU and the International\nFederation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers\u2019 Unions (ICEM) sent a\nmission to Bhopal to study the causes and effects of the gas leak. The report\ncontained recommendations for preventing similar disasters and endorsed a list\nof safety principles; this report has been used by trade unionists in both\nindustrialized and developing countries as a basis of programmes for improving\nhealth and safety at work.\n\nSource: Rice 1995.  \n  \n---  \n  \nTrade unions are structured along various lines: by craft or occupation, by\nbranch of industry, by whether they group white- or blue-collar workers and\nsometimes even by enterprise. There are also general unions, which include\nworkers from various occupations and industries. Even in countries where\nmergers of industrial unions and general unions are the trend, the situation\nof agricultural or rural workers has often favoured the development of special\nstructures for that sector. On top of this breakdown there is often a\nterritorial division, with regional and sometimes local subunits, within a\nunion. In some countries there have been splits in the labour movement around\nideological (party politics) and even religious lines which then come to be\nreflected in trade union structure and membership. Public sector employees\ntend to be represented by unions separate from those representing employees in\nthe private sector, although there are exceptions to this as well.\n\nThe legal status of a trade union may be that of any other association, or it\nmay be subject to special rules. A great number of countries require trade\nunions to register and to divulge certain basic information to the authorities\n(name, address, identity of officials, etc.). In some countries this goes\nbeyond mere record-keeping to interference; in extreme cases of disregard for\nfreedom of association principles, trade unions will need government\nauthorization to operate. As representatives of workers, trade unions are\nempowered to enter into engagements on their behalf. Some countries (such as\nthe United States) require employer recognition of trade unions as an initial\nprerequisite to engaging in collective bargaining.\n\nTrade union density varies widely between and within countries. In some\ncountries in Western Europe, for instance, it is very high in the public\nsector but tends to be low in the private sector and especially in its white-\ncollar employment. The figures for blue-collar employment in that region are\nmixed, from a high in Austria and Sweden to a low in France, where, however,\ntrade union political power far exceeds what membership figures would suggest.\nThere is some positive correlation between centralization of bargaining and\ntrade union density, but exceptions to this also exist.\n\nAs voluntary associations, trade unions draw up their own rules, usually in\nthe form of a constitution and by-laws. In democratic trade union structures,\nmembers select trade union officers either by direct vote or through delegates\nto a general conference. Internal union government in a small, highly\ndecentralized union of workers in a particular occupational group is likely to\ndiffer significantly from that found in a large, centralized general or\nindustrial union. There are tasks to allocate among union officers, between\npaid and unpaid union representatives and coordination work to be done. The\nfinancial resources available to a union will also vary depending upon its\nsize and the ease with which it can collect dues. Institution of a dues check-\noff system (whereby dues are deducted from a worker\u2019s wages and paid directly\nto the union) alleviates this task greatly. In most of Central and Eastern\nEurope, trade unions that were dominated and funded by the state are being\ntransformed and/or joined by new independent organizations; all are struggling\nto find a place and operate successfully in the new economic structure.\nExtremely low wages (and thus dues) there and in developing countries with\ngovernment-supported unions make it difficult to build a strong independent\nunion movement.\n\nIn addition to the important function of collective bargaining, one of the\nmain activities of trade unions in many countries is their political work.\nThis may take the form of direct representation, with trade unions being given\nreserved seats in some parliaments (e.g., Senegal) and on tripartite bodies\nthat have a role in determining national economic and social policy (e.g.,\nAustria, France, the Netherlands), or on tripartite advisory bodies in the\nfields of labour and social affairs (e.g., in many Latin American and some\nAfrican and Asian countries). In the European Union, trade union federations\nhave had an important impact on the development of social policy. More\ntypically, trade unions have an influence through the exercise of power\n(backed up by a threat of industrial action) and lobbying political decision\nmakers at the national level. It is certainly true that trade unions have\nsuccessfully fought for greater legislative protection for all workers around\nthe world; some believe that this has been a bittersweet victory, in the long\nrun undermining their own justification to exist. The objectives and issues of\nunion political action have often extended well beyond narrower interests; a\nprime example of this was the struggle against apartheid within South Africa\nand the international solidarity expressed by unions around the world in words\nand in deeds (e.g., organizing dockworker boycotts of imported South African\ncoal). Whether trade union political activity is on the offence or the defence\nwill of course depend largely on whether the government in power tends to be\npro- or anti-labour. It will also depend upon the union\u2019s relationship to\npolitical parties; some unions, particularly in Africa, were part of their\ncountries\u2019 struggles for independence and maintain very close ties with ruling\npolitical parties. In other countries there is a traditional interdependence\nbetween the labour movement and a political party (e.g., Australia, United\nKingdom), whereas in others alliances may shift over time. In any event, the\npower of trade unions often exceeds what would be expected from their\nnumerical strength, particularly where they represent workers in a key\neconomic or public service sector, such as transport or mining.\n\nAside from trade unions, many other types of workers\u2019 participation have\nsprung up to provide indirect or direct representation of employees. In some\ninstances they exist alongside trade unions; in others they are the only type\nof participation available to workers. The functions and powers of workers\u2019\nrepresentatives that exist under such arrangements are described in the\narticle \u201cForms of workers\u2019 participation\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe third type of function of trade unions, providing services to members,\nfocuses first and foremost on the workplace. A shop steward at the enterprise\nlevel is there to ensure that workers\u2019 rights under the collective bargaining\nagreement and the law are being respected\u2013and, if not, to take action. The\nunion officer\u2019s job is to defend the interests of workers vis-\u00e0-vis\nmanagement, thereby legitimizing his or her own representative role. This may\ninvolve taking up an individual grievance over discipline or dismissal, or\ncooperating with management on a joint health and safety committee. Outside\nthe workplace, many unions provide other types of benefit, such as\npreferential access to credit and participation in welfare schemes. The union\nhall can also serve as a centre for cultural events or even large family\nceremonies. The range of services a union can offer to its members is vast and\nreflects the creativity and resources of the union itself as well as the\ncultural milieu in which it operates.\n\nAs Visser observes:\n\nThe power of trade unions depends on various internal and external factors. We\ncan distinguish between organizational power (how many internal sources of\npower can unions mobilize?), institutional power (which external sources of\nsupport can unions depend on?) and economic power (which market forces play\ninto the hands of unions?) (Visser in van Ruysseveldt et al. 1995).\n\nAmong the factors he identifies for a strong trade union structure are the\nmobilization of a large, stable, dues-paying and well-trained membership (to\nthis could be added a membership that reflects the composition of the labour\nmarket), avoidance of organizational fragmentation and political or\nideological rifts and development of an organizational structure that provides\na presence at the company level while having central control of funds and\ndecision making. Whether such a model for success, which to date has been\nnational in character, can evolve in the face of an increasingly\ninternationalized economy, is the great challenge facing trade unions at this\njuncture.\n\n## RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION AND REPRESENTATION\n\nBreen Creighton\n\n### Relationship between Rights of Association and Representation and\nOccupational Safety and Health\n\nJoint consultation and participation can be effective only in an environment\nwhere there is adequate recognition of and respect for the right of employers\nand workers to associate freely and for their organizations to be able to\nrepresent their interests effectively. In a very real sense, therefore,\nrespect for the right to organize can be seen to be an essential precondition\nof an effective occupational safety and health strategy at both the national\nand international level and at the workplace. That being the case, it is\nnecessary and appropriate to look more closely at ILO standards relating to\nfreedom of association, bearing in mind their application in the context of\nthe prevention of work-related injury and disease and the compensation and\nrehabilitation of those who have incurred such injury or disease. Freedom of\nassociation standards require that there be proper recognition in law and\npractice of the right of workers and employers to form and to join the\norganizations of their choice and of the right of those organizations, once\nestablished, to formulate and to implement freely their programmes.\n\nRights of association and representation also underpin tripartite\n(governments, employers and workers) cooperation in the field of occupational\nhealth and safety. Such cooperation is promoted in the context of ILO\nstandard-setting, for example, by:\n\n\u00b7 enjoining governments to consult with representative organizations of\nemployers and workers in relation to the formulation and implementation of\npolicy on occupational health and safety at the national or regional level\n(e.g., Asbestos Convention, 1986 (No. 162), Article 4 and Occupational Safety\nand Health Convention, 1981 (No. 155), Articles 1 and 8)\n\n\u00b7 encouraging joint consultation and cooperation on occupational safety and\nhealth matters at the level of the workplace (e.g., Prevention of Major\nIndustrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174), Article 9(f) and (g))\n\n\u00b7 requiring the joint participation of employers and workers in the\nformulation and implementation of occupational safety and health policy in the\nworkplace (see especially Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No.\n155), Articles 19 and 20 and Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation,\n1981 (No. 164), para 12).\n\n### ILO and Rights of Association and Representation\n\nThe \u201cright of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as\nby the employers\u201d was one of the methods and principles set out in Article 41\nof the original Constitution of the ILO. This principle now finds express\nrecognition in the Preamble to the Constitution as one of the essential\npreconditions of the establishment of social justice, which is itself seen as\nthe essential precondition of universal and lasting peace. Together with the\nprinciple of tripartism, it is also accorded express recognition in Article I\nof the Declaration of Philadelphia, which was appended to the Constitution in\n1946. This Constitutional endorsement of the importance of respect for the\nprinciples of freedom of association helps provide one of the juridical bases\nfor the capacity of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of\nAssociation and the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association to\ninquire into alleged breaches of the principles of freedom of association.\n\nAs early as 1921 the International Labour Conference adopted the Right of\nAssociation (Agriculture) Convention (No. 11), which requires ratifying States\nto \u201csecure to all those engaged in agriculture the same rights of association\nand combination as to industrial workers\u201d. It does not, however, say anything\nabout the rights which are to be accorded to the industrial workers with whom\nthose engaged in agriculture are to enjoy parity! Attempts to adopt a more\ngeneral instrument dealing with freedom of association in the 1920s foundered\nupon the rocks of employer and government insistence that the right to form\nand join trade unions must be accompanied by a correlative right not to join.\nThe matter was re-opened in the period immediately after the Second World War.\nThis duly resulted in the adoption of the Right of Association (Non-\nMetropolitan Territories) Convention, 1947 (No. 84), the Freedom of\nAssociation and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)\nand the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\n\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are among the most important and the most widely\nratified of all ILO Conventions: as of 31 December 1996, Convention No. 87 had\nattracted 119 ratifications, while No. 98 had attracted 133. Between them they\nembody what can properly be regarded as the four key elements in the notion of\nfreedom of association. They are regarded as the benchmark for the\ninternational protection of freedom of association for trade union purposes,\nas reflected, for example, in Article 8 of the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article 22 of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Within the ILO structure, they form\nthe basis for the principles of freedom of association as developed and\napplied by the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association and the\nFact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, even\nthough in technical terms those bodies derive their jurisdiction from the\nConstitution of the Organization rather than the Conventions. They also\nconstitute a major focus for the deliberations of the Committee of Experts on\nthe Application of Conventions and Recommendations and of the Conference\nCommittee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n\nDespite the pivotal role of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, it should be\nappreciated that they are by no means the only formal standard-setting\ninstruments which have been adopted under the auspices of the ILO in the field\nof freedom of association. On the contrary, since 1970 the Conference has\nadopted further four Conventions and four Recommendations dealing in greater\ndetail with various aspects of the principles of freedom of association, or\nwith their application in certain specific contexts:\n\n\u00b7 the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135) and Recommendation (No.\n143), 1971\n\n\u00b7 the Rural Workers\u2019 Organizations Convention (No. 141) and Recommendation\n(No. 149), 1975\n\n\u00b7 the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention (No. 151) and\nRecommendation (No. 158), 1978\n\n\u00b7 the Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 154) and Recommendation (No. 163),\n1981\n\n### Principles of Freedom of Association\n\n#### The core elements\n\nThe core elements of the principles of freedom of association as embodied in\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are:\n\n\u00b7 that \u201cworkers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the\nright to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization\nconcerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without previous\nauthorization\u201d (Article 2 of Convention No. 87)\n\n\u00b7 that organizations of employers and workers, once established, should have\nthe right \u201cto draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their\nrepresentatives in full freedom, to organize their administration and\nactivities and to formulate their programmes\u201d (Article 3(1) of Convention No.\n87). Furthermore, the public authorities must \u201crefrain from any interference\nwhich would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof\u201d\n(Article 3(2))\n\n\u00b7 that workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination in respect of their employment\u201d (Article 1(1) of Convention No.\n98)\n\n\u00b7 that \u201cmeasures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where\nnecessary, to encourage and to promote the full development and utilization of\nmachinery for voluntary negotiation between employers and employers\u2019\norganizations and workers\u2019 organizations, with a view to the regulation of\nterms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements\u201d (Article\n4 of Convention No. 98)\n\nAll of the guarantees provided by Convention No. 87 are subject to the proviso\nset out in Article 8(1): \u201cin exercising the rights provided for in this\nConvention workers and employers and their respective organizations... shall\nrespect the law of the land\u201d. This in turn is subject to the further proviso\nthat the \u201claw of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be\napplied so as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that by virtue of Article 9(1) of Convention No. 87 it\nis permissible, but not necessary, to qualify the application of the\nguarantees set out in that Convention to members of the police and of the\narmed forces. Article 5(1) of Convention No. 98 is to the same effect, while\nArticle 6 of that instrument stipulates that the Convention \u201cdoes not deal\nwith the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the\nState, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their rights or status in any\nway.\u201d\n\n#### The right to join\n\nThe right of workers and employers to form and to join the organizations of\ntheir choice is the pivot of all of the other guarantees provided by\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 and by the principles of freedom of association. It\nis subject only to the qualification set out in Article 9(1) of the\nConvention. This means that it is not permissible to deny any group of workers\nother than members of the police or the armed forces the right to form or join\nthe trade unions of their choice. It follows that denial or restriction of the\nright of public servants, agricultural workers, school teachers and so on to\nform or join the organizations of their choice would not be consistent with\nthe requirements of Article 2.\n\nIt is, however, permissible for the rules of a trade union or an employer\norganization to restrict the categories of workers or employers who may join\nthe organization. The point is that any such restriction must be the result of\nthe free choice of the members of the organization \u2013 it must not be imposed\nfrom outside.\n\nThe right to associate set out in Article 2 is not accompanied by any\ncorrelative right not to associate. It will be recalled that earlier attempts\nto adopt a general freedom of association convention failed because of the\ninsistence by employer and some government delegates that the positive right\nto associate must carry with it a negative right not to associate. This issue\nwas again raised in the context of the debates on Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\nHowever on this occasion a compromise was effected whereby the Conference\nadopted a resolution to the effect that the extent to which trade union\nsecurity devices (such as the \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d shop and check-off\narrangements for trade union dues) were permissible or otherwise was a matter\nto be determined by national law and practice. In other words, the Conventions\nare considered neither to condone nor to condemn the closed shop and other\nforms of union security device, although such measures are not regarded as\nacceptable if they are imposed by law rather than adopted by agreement of the\nparties (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a).\n\nPerhaps the most difficult issue which has arisen in the context of Article 2\nrelates to the extent to which it can be said to endorse the notion of trade\nunion pluralism. In other words, is it consistent with Article 2 for the law\nto limit, directly or indirectly, the right of workers (or employers) to form\nor join the organization of their choice through the application of\nadministrative or legislative criteria?\n\nThere are two sets of competing interests in this context. On the one hand,\nArticle 2 is clearly meant to protect the right of workers and employers to\nchoose the organization to which they wish to belong and to choose not to\nbelong to organizations with which they are out of sympathy on political,\ndenominational or other grounds. On the other hand, governments (and indeed\ntrade unions) may argue that the excessive proliferation of trade unions and\nemployer organizations which may be an incident of unrestricted freedom of\nchoice is not conducive to the development of free and effective organizations\nor the establishment and maintenance of orderly industrial relations\nprocesses. This was an issue of particular difficulty in the Cold War era,\nwhen governments often sought to restrict the range of unions to which workers\ncould belong on ideological grounds. It remains a highly sensitive issue in\nmany developing countries where governments, for good reason or ill, wish to\nprevent what they see as the excessive proliferation of trade unions by\nplacing restrictions on the number and/or size of unions which can operate in\na given workplace or sector of the economy. The ILO\u2019s supervisory bodies have\ntended to adopt a fairly restrictive approach to this issue, permitting trade\nunion monopolies where they are the result of the free choice of the workers\nin the country concerned and permitting the adoption of \u201creasonable\u201d\nregistration criteria, but taking exception to legally imposed monopolies and\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d registration criteria. In doing so, they have attracted\nconsiderable criticism, especially from governments in developing countries\nwhich accuse them of adopting a Eurocentric approach to the application of the\nConvention \u2013 the point being that the characteristically European concern with\nthe rights of the individual is said to be inconsistent with the collectivist\ntraditions of many non-European cultures.\n\n#### Organizational autonomy and the right to strike\n\nIf Article 2 of Convention No. 87 protects the fundamental right of employers\nand workers to form and to join the organization of their choice, then Article\n3 can be seen to provide its logical corollary by protecting the\norganizational autonomy of organizations once established.\n\nAs the wording of Article 3(1) clearly indicates, this would include the\ndrafting, adoption and implementation of the constitutions and rules of\norganizations and the conduct of elections. However, the supervisory bodies\nhave accepted that it is permissible for the public authorities to impose\nminimum conditions upon the content or administration of rules for the purpose\nof \u201censuring a sound administration and preventing legal complications arising\nas a result of constitutions and rules being drawn up in insufficient detail\u201d\n(ILO 1994b). However, if such conditions are excessively detailed or onerous\nin application then they are likely to be adjudged to be inconsistent with the\nrequirements of Article 3.\n\nOver the years the supervisory bodies have consistently taken the view that\n\u201cthe right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right to organize\nprotected by Convention No. 87\u201d (ILO 1994b):\n\nThe Committee (of Experts) considers that the right to strike is one of the\nessential means available to workers and their organizations for the\nprotection of their economic and social interests. These interests not only\nhave to do with obtaining better working conditions and pursuing collective\ndemands of an occupational nature, but also with seeking solutions to economic\nand social policy questions and to labour problems of any kind which are of\ndirect concern to the workers.\n\nThis is one of the most controversial aspects of the entire jurisprudence\nrelating to freedom of association and in recent years in particular it has\ncome in for vigorous criticism from employer and government members of the\nConference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n(See, for example, International Labour Conference, 80th Session (1993),\nRecord of Proceedings, 25/10-12 and 25/58-64 and International Labour\nConference, 81st Session (1994), Record of Proceedings, 25/92-94 and\n25/179-180.) It is, however, a firmly entrenched feature of the jurisprudence\non freedom of association. It finds clear recognition in Article 8(1) (d) of\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and was\nendorsed by the Committee of Experts in its 1994 General Survey on Freedom of\nAssociation and Collective Bargaining (ILO 1994b).\n\nIt is important to appreciate, however, that the right to strike as recognized\nby the supervisory bodies is not an unqualified one. In the first place, it\ndoes not extend to those groups of workers in relation to whom it is\npermissible to attenuate the guarantees set out in Convention No. 87, namely\nmembers of the police and armed forces. Furthermore, it has also been\ndetermined that the right to strike may legitimately be denied to \u201cpublic\nservants acting as agents of the public authority\u201d and to workers engaged in\nessential services in the sense of \u201cservices whose interruption would endanger\nthe life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.\u201d\nHowever, any restrictions upon the right to strike of workers in these latter\ncategories must be offset by compensatory guarantees, such as \u201cconciliation\nand mediation procedures leading, in the event of a deadlock, to arbitration\nmachinery seen to be reliable by the parties concerned. It is essential that\nthe latter be able to participate in determining and implementing the\nprocedure, which should furthermore provide sufficient guarantees of\nimpartiality and rapidity: arbitration awards should be binding on both\nparties and once issued should be implemented rapidly and completely\u201d (ILO\n1994b).\n\nIt is also permissible to impose temporary restrictions upon the right to\nstrike in times of \u201cacute national emergency\u201d. More generally, it is\npermissible to impose preconditions such as balloting requirements, exhaustion\nof conciliation procedures and so on, upon the exercise of the right to\nstrike. However, all such restrictions must \u201cbe reasonable and... not such as\nto place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union\norganizations\u201d.\n\nThe right to strike is often described as the weapon of last resort in\ncollective bargaining. If Article 3 is interpreted so as to protect the weapon\nof last resort, it seems reasonable to suppose that it must also protect the\nprocess of collective bargaining itself. The supervisory bodies have indeed\ntaken this view on a number of occasions, but in general they have preferred\nto base their jurisprudence on collective bargaining upon Article 4 of\nConvention No. 98. (For more detailed discussion of the ILO jurisprudence on\nthe right to strike, see Hodges-Aeberhard and Odero de Dios 1987; Ben-Israel\n1988).\n\nThe autonomy of organizations of employers and workers is also addressed in\nArticles 4 to 7 of Convention No. 87 and in Article 2 of Convention No. 98.\nArticle 4 provides that such organizations must not be \u201cliable to be dissolved\nor suspended by administrative authority\u201d. This does not mean that trade\nunions or employers\u2019 organizations cannot be deregistered or dissolved where\nthey have, for example, engaged in gross industrial misconduct or have not\nbeen run in accordance with their rules. But it does mean that any such\nsanction must be imposed through a duly constituted court or other appropriate\nbody, rather than by administrative diktat.\n\nArticle 5 protects the rights of organizations to form and join federations\nand confederations and also the right of organizations, federations and\nconfederations to affiliate with international organizations of employers and\nworkers. Furthermore, according to Article 6, the guarantees set out in\nArticles 2, 3 and 4 apply to federations and confederations in the same way as\nto first level organizations, while Article 7 stipulates that the acquisition\nof legal personality by organizations of employers or workers must not be made\nsubject to \u201cconditions of such a character as to restrict the application of\nthe provisions of Articles 2, 3 and 4.\u201d\n\nFinally, Article 2(1) of Convention No. 98 requires that organizations of\nemployers and workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of\ninterference by each other or each other\u2019s agents or members in their\nestablishment, functioning or administration\u201d. In practical terms, it seems\nsomewhat unlikely that trade unions would or could effectively interfere with\nthe internal functioning of employer organizations. It is quite conceivable,\nhowever, that in certain circumstances employers or their organizations would\nseek to interfere with the internal affairs of workers\u2019 organizations \u2013 for\nexample, by providing some or all of their funds. This possibility finds\nexpress recognition in Article 2(2):\n\nIn particular, acts which are designed to promote the establishment of\nworkers\u2019 organizations under the domination of employers or employers\u2019\norganizations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such\norganizations under the control of employers or employers\u2019 organizations,\nshall be deemed to constitute acts of interference within the meaning of this\nArticle.\n\n#### Protection against victimization\n\nFor the guarantees set out in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 to be meaningful in\npractice, it is clearly necessary that individuals who exercise their right to\nform or join organizations of workers be protected against victimization on\naccount of having done so. This logic finds recognition in Article 1(1) of\nConvention No. 98, which, as indicated, requires that \u201cworkers shall enjoy\nadequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of\ntheir employment.\u201d Article 1(2) takes the matter further:\n\nSuch protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated\nto:\n\n(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not\njoin a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;\n\n(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union\nmembership or because of participation in union activities outside working\nhours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.\n\nAnti-union discrimination for these purposes would include refusal to employ,\ndismissal and other measures such as \u201ctransfer, relocation, demotion,\ndeprivation or restrictions of all kinds (remuneration, social benefits,\nvocational training)\u201d which may cause serious prejudice to the worker\nconcerned (see also Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158),\nArticle 5(a), (b) and (c), as well as ILO 1994b, para.212).\n\nNot only must there be comprehensive protection against anti-union\ndiscrimination as defined, but by virtue of Article 3 of Convention No. 98,\nthere must also be effective means of enforcing those protections:\n\nLegal standards are inadequate if they are not coupled with effective and\nexpeditious procedures and with sufficiently dissuasive penal sanctions to\nensure their application ... The onus placed on the employer to prove the\nalleged anti-union discriminatory measures are connected with questions other\nthan trade union matters, or presumptions established in the worker\u2019s favour\nare additional means of ensuring effective protection of the right to organize\nguaranteed by the Convention. Legislation which allows the employer in\npractice to terminate the employment of a worker on condition that he pay the\ncompensation provided for by law in any case of unjustified dismissal... is\ninadequate under the terms of Article 1 of the Convention. Legislation should\nalso provide effective means for implementing means of compensation, with the\nreinstatement of the dismissed worker, including retroactive compensation,\nbeing the most appropriate remedy in such cases of anti-union discrimination\n(ILO 1994b).\n\n#### Collective bargaining\n\nThe guarantee set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 has been interpreted\nso as to protect both the right to engage in collective bargaining and the\nautonomy of the bargaining process. In other words it is not consistent with\nArticle 4 for employers and workers to be denied the right to engage in\ncollective bargaining if they wish to do so\u2014bearing in mind that it is not\ninconsistent with the Convention to deny these rights to members of the police\nor the armed forces and that \u201cthe Convention does not deal with the position\nof public servants engaged in the administration of the State\u201d. Not only must\nthe parties be free to engage in collective bargaining if they so choose, but\nthey must be permitted to reach their own agreement on their own terms without\ninterference by the public authorities \u2013 subject to certain qualifications for\n\u201ccompelling reasons of national economic interest\u201d (ILO 1994) and to\nreasonable requirements as to form, registration and so on.\n\nArticle 4 has not, however, been interpreted as protecting the right to\nrecognition for purposes of collective bargaining. The supervisory bodies have\nrepeatedly emphasized the desirability of such recognition, but have not been\nprepared to take the further step of determining that refusal to recognize\nand/or the absence of a mechanism whereby employers can be obliged to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong constitutes a breach of\nArticle 4 (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a). They have justified this interpretation on\nthe basis that compulsory recognition would deprive collective bargaining of\nits voluntary character as envisaged by Article 4 (ILO 1995a). As against\nthat, it might be argued that the ostensible right to engage in collective\nbargaining must inevitably be compromised if employers are to be free to\nrefuse to engage in such bargaining notwithstanding that they have the right\nso to bargain if they wish. Furthermore, permitting employers to refuse to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong seems to sit somewhat\nuneasily with the duty to \u201cpromote\u201d collective bargaining, which appears to be\nthe principal purpose of Article 4 (Creighton 1994).\n\n### Application of Freedom of Association Principles in the Context of\nOccupational Safety and Health\n\nIt was suggested earlier that ILO standards relating to occupational safety\nand health endorse the concept of bipartite or tripartite involvement in three\nprincipal contexts: (1) the formulation and implementation of policy at\nnational and regional level; (2) consultation between employers and workers at\nthe level of the workplace; and (3) joint participation between employers and\nworkers in the formulation and implementation of policy at the level of the\nworkplace. It should be clear from the foregoing that the effective\ninvolvement of employers and (especially) workers in all three contexts is\ncrucially dependent upon adequate recognition of their rights of association\nand representation.\n\nRespect for the right to form and to join organizations is clearly an\nessential precondition of all three forms of joint involvement. Consultation\nand participation at the governmental level is feasible only where there are\nstrong and effective organizations which can be seen to be representative of\nthe interests of their constituencies. This is necessary both for ease of\ncommunication and so that government will feel constrained to take seriously\nthe views expressed by the representatives of employers and workers. A\nfortiori, consultation and participation at the level of the workplace is a\nrealistic proposition only if workers have the capacity to form and to join\norganizations which can represent their interests in discussions with\nemployers and their organizations, provide back-up resources for worker\nrepresentatives, assist in dealings with public inspectorates and so on.\nTheoretically, worker representatives could operate at the level of the\nworkplace without having any necessary connection with a more broadly based\norganization, but the reality of power relations in most workplaces is such\nthat they are unlikely to be able to do so in an effective manner without the\nsupport of an industrial organization. At the very least, workers must have\nthe right to have their interests represented in this manner if they so\nchoose.\n\nThe organizational autonomy of employer and worker organizations is also an\nessential precondition of meaningful participation at all levels. It is\nnecessary, for example, that worker organizations should have the right to\nformulate and to implement their policies on occupational safety and health\nissues without outside interference, for purposes of consultation with\ngovernment in relation to: (1) issues such as the legal regulation of\nhazardous processes or substances; or (2) the formulation of legislative\npolicy relating to compensation for work-related injury or the rehabilitation\nof injured workers. Such autonomy is even more important at the level of the\nworkplace, where worker organizations need to develop and maintain a capacity\nto represent the interests of their members in discussion with employers on\noccupational safety and health issues. This might include having rights of\naccess to workplaces for union officials and/or health and safety specialists;\ninvoking the assistance of the public authorities in relation to hazardous\nsituations; and in certain circumstances organizing industrial action in order\nto protect the health and safety of their members.\n\nTo be effective, organizational autonomy also requires that trade union\nmembers and officials be accorded adequate protection against victimization on\ngrounds of their trade union membership or activities, or on account of their\nhaving initiated or participated in legal proceedings relating to occupational\nsafety and health matters. In other words, the guarantees against\ndiscrimination set out in Article 1 of Convention No. 98 are as relevant to\ntrade union activity relating to occupational safety and health as to other\nforms of union activity such as collective bargaining, membership recruitment\nand so on.\n\nThe right to engage in autonomous collective bargaining is also a crucial\nelement in effective worker participation in relation to occupational safety\nand health. The guarantees set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 are\nimportant in this context. However, as indicated, those guarantees do not\nextend to the right to be recognized for purposes of such bargaining. On the\nother hand provisions such as Article 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155) may be seen as coming very close to requiring trade\nunion recognition in the context of occupational safety and health:\n\nThere shall be arrangements at the level of the undertaking under which:\n\n\u00b7 representatives of workers in an undertaking are given adequate information\non measures taken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and\nmay consult their representative organizations about such information provided\nthey do not disclose commercial secrets;\n\n\u00b7 workers and their representatives in the undertaking are given appropriate\ntraining in occupational safety and health;\n\n\u00b7 workers or their representatives and, as the case may be, their\nrepresentative organizations in an undertaking, in accordance with national\nlaw and practice, are enabled to inquire into, and are consulted by the\nemployer on, all aspects of occupational safety and health associated with\ntheir work...\n\nIn practical terms it would be very difficult to give effect to these\nprovisions without according some kind of formal recognition to the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. This in turn serves to emphasize yet again the\nimportance of adequate recognition of rights of association and representation\nas a precondition of the development and implementation of effective\noccupational safety and health strategies at both the national and enterprise\nlevel.\n\n## COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SAFETY AND HEALTH\n\nMichael J. Wright\n\nCollective bargaining is the process through which workers negotiate, as a\ngroup, with their employer; this can occur at various levels (enterprise,\nindustry/sector, national). Traditionally, the subjects of the negotiation are\nwages, benefits, working conditions and fair treatment. However, collective\nbargaining can also address issues that do not directly affect the workers\nemployed in the enterprise, such as increased old-age pensions for workers\nalready retired. Less often, collective bargaining addresses issues that reach\nwell beyond the workplace, such as protection of the external environment.\n\nIn a very small enterprise, it is possible for all the workers to negotiate as\na body with their employer. This kind of informal collective bargaining has\nexisted for centuries. Today, however, most collective bargaining is carried\nout by workers\u2019 organizations, or unions.\n\nThe definition used in the ILO Convention concerning the promotion of\ncollective bargaining, 1981 (No.154), Article 2, is broad:\n\nthe term... extends to all negotiations which take place between an employer,\na group of employers or one or more employers\u2019 organizations, on the one hand,\nand one or more workers\u2019 organizations, on the other, for \u2013\n\n(a) determining working conditions and terms of employment; and/or\n\n(b) regulating relations between employers and workers; and/or\n\n(c) regulating relations between employers or their organizations and a\nworkers\u2019 organization or workers\u2019 organizations.\n\nCollective bargaining is an important tool for raising living standards and\nimproving working conditions. Even though safety and health is addressed in\nthe national law of almost all countries, collective bargaining often provides\nthe mechanism through which the law is implemented in the workplace. For\nexample, the law may mandate joint safety and health committees or works\ncouncils, but leave the details to be negotiated between the employer and the\nworkers\u2019 organization.\n\nUnfortunately, collective bargaining is under attack by authoritarian\nemployers and repressive governments, both in developed and developing\ncountries. It rarely exists in the informal sector or in small, traditional\nenterprises. As a result, the majority of the world\u2019s workers do not yet enjoy\nthe benefits of effective collective bargaining under a framework of worker\nrights guaranteed by law.\n\n### History of Union Action for Safety and Health\n\nThere is a long history of workers\u2019 organizations taking collective action for\nsafety and health. In 1775, Percival Pott, an English surgeon, made the first\nknown report of occupational cancer \u2013 skin cancer in London chimney sweeps\n(Lehman 1977). Two years later the Danish Chimney Sweepers Guild, in what was\nthe first known response by a workers\u2019 organization to the threat of\noccupational cancer, ordered that apprentices be given the means for a daily\nbath.\n\nHowever, safety and health seldom was an explicit issue in early labour\nstruggles. Workers in dangerous jobs were overwhelmed by more pressing\nproblems, such as low wages, crushing hours of work and the arbitrary power of\nfactory and mine owners. Safety hazards were obvious in the daily toll of\ninjury and death, but occupational health was not well understood. Workers\u2019\norganizations were weak and under constant attack by owners and governments.\nSimple survival was the primary goal of workers\u2019 organizations. As a result,\nthe grievances of nineteenth-century workers rarely manifested themselves in\ncampaigns for safer conditions (Corn 1978).\n\n#### The Labour Agreement between the Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the\nUnited Steelworkers of America\n\nThe agreement between Bethlehem Steel and the United Steelworkers of America\nis typical of company-wide agreements in large unionized manufacturing\nenterprises in the United States. Steel industry labour agreements have\ncontained safety and health articles for more than 50 years. Many provisions\nnegotiated in the past gave workers and the union rights that were later\nguaranteed by law. Despite this redundancy, the provisions still appear in the\ncontract as a hedge against changes in the law, and to allow the union the\noption of taking violations to impartial arbitration rather than the courts.\n\nThe Bethlehem agreement runs from 1 August 1993 to 1 August 1999. It covers\n17,000 workers in six plants. The full agreement is 275 pages long; 17 pages\nare devoted to safety and health.\n\nSection 1 of the safety and health article pledges the company and the union\nto cooperate in the objective of eliminating accidents and health hazards. It\nobligates the company to provide safe and healthful workplaces, obey federal\nand state law, provide employees with the necessary protective equipment free\nof charge, provide chemical safety information to the union and inform workers\nof the hazards and controls for toxic substances. It grants the union\u2019s\ncentral safety and health department the right to any information in the\ncompany\u2019s possession that is \u201crelevant and material\u201d to an understanding of\npotential hazards. It requires the company to make air sampling tests and\nenvironmental investigations at the request of the union co-chairperson of the\nplant\u2019s safety and health committee.\n\nSection 2 sets up joint union-management safety and health committees at the\nplant and national levels, prescribes the rules under which they operate,\nmandates training for committee members, gives members of the committee access\nto all parts of the plant to facilitate the committee\u2019s work and specifies the\napplicable rates of pay for committee members on committee business. The\nsection also specifies how disputes over protective equipment are to be\nresolved, requires the company to notify the union of all potentially\ndisabling accidents, sets up a system of joint accident investigation,\nrequires the company to gather and supply to the union certain safety and\nhealth statistics, and establishes an extensive safety and health training\nprogramme for all employees.\n\nSection 3 gives workers the right to remove themselves from work involving\nhazards beyond those \u201cinherent in the operation\u201d and provides an arbitration\nmechanism through which disputes over such work refusals can be resolved.\nUnder this provision, a worker cannot be disciplined for acting in good faith\nand on the basis of objective evidence, even if a subsequent investigation\nshows that the hazard did not in fact exist.\n\nSection 4 specifies that the committee\u2019s role is advisory, and that committee\nmembers and officers of the union acting in their official capacity are not to\nbe held liable for injuries or illnesses.\n\nSection 5 states that alcoholism and drug abuse are treatable conditions, and\nsets up a programme of rehabilitation.\n\nSection 6 establishes an extensive programme for controlling carbon monoxide,\na serious hazard in primary steel production.\n\nSection 7 provides workers with vouchers for the purchase of safety shoes.\n\nSection 8 requires the company to keep individual medical records confidential\nexcept in certain limited circumstances. However, workers have access to their\nown medical records, and may release them to the union or to a personal\nphysician. In addition, physicians for the company are required to notify\nworkers of adverse medical findings.\n\nSection 9 establishes a medical surveillance programme.\n\nSection 10 establishes a programme for investigating and controlling the\nhazards of video display terminals.\n\nSection 11 establishes full-time safety representatives in each plant, chosen\nby the union but paid by the company.\n\nIn addition, an appendix to the agreement commits the company and the union to\nreview each plant\u2019s safety programme for mobile equipment operating on rails.\n(Fixed rail equipment is the leading cause of death by traumatic injury in the\nAmerican steel industry.)  \n  \n---  \n  \nHowever, safety and health sometimes joined other issues in early labour\nstruggles. In the late 1820s, workers in the textile industry in the United\nStates began to agitate for shorter working hours. Many of the workers were\nwomen, as were the leaders of such rudimentary unions as the female labour\nreform associations of New England. The proposed 10-hour day was seen mostly\nas an issue of general welfare. But in testimony before the Massachusetts\nlegislature, workers also decried the effects of 12- and 14-hour days in badly\nventilated mills, describing a \u201cwasting sickness\u201d they attributed to cotton\ndust and bad ventilation, in what are now recognized as some of the first\nreports of byssinosis. They had little success in winning recognition from the\nmill owners, or action from the legislature (Foner 1977).\n\nOther union actions dealt more with the effects of occupational hazards than\nwith their prevention. Many nineteenth-century unions adopted welfare\nprogrammes for their members, including disability payments to the injured and\nbenefits for survivors. US and Canadian mining unions went one step further,\nestablishing hospitals, clinics and even cemeteries for their members\n(Derickson 1988). While unions attempted to negotiate better conditions with\nemployers, most agitation for safety and health in North America was in mines\naimed at state and provincial legislatures (Fox 1990).\n\nIn Europe, the situation began to change around the turn of the century with\nthe rise of stronger workers\u2019 organizations. In 1903, the German and French\npainters\u2019 unions began a campaign against the hazards of lead paint. The\nFactory Workers Union of Germany had an active industrial hygiene programme by\n1911, published education materials on chemical hazards and began a campaign\nfor safeguards against chromate-induced lung cancer, ultimately leading to a\nchange in the production method. Trade unions in the United Kingdom\nrepresented their members in workers\u2019 compensation cases and fought for better\nlaws and regulations. Their work showed the interplay between collective\nbargaining for safety and health and the factory inspection system. In 1905,\nfor example, trade unions filed 268 complaints with the British factory\ninspectorate (Teleky 1948). As early as 1942, the Swedish Employers\u2019\nConfederation and the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions reached a\nnationwide Working Environment Agreement regarding local safety and health\nservices. The agreement has been revised and extended several times; in 1976\nthe original parties were joined by the Federation of Salaried Employees\n(Joint Industrial Safety Council of Sweden 1988).\n\nNorth America lagged behind. Formal corporate safety programmes were\ninstituted by some large employers around the turn of the century (for a\ndescription of such programmes in the steel industry see Brody (1960), or the\nself-congratulatory Year Book of the American Iron and Steel Institute for\n1914 (AISI 1915)). The programmes were highly paternalistic, relied more on\ndiscipline than education and often were based on the premise that workers\nthemselves were largely to blame for industrial accidents. Major disasters\nsuch as New York\u2019s 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, which killed 146 workers,\nled to union campaigns for improvement and ultimately to improved fire safety\nlaws. However, safety and health as a widespread labour issue came only with\nthe rise of strong unions in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942, for example, the\nfounding Constitution of the United Steelworkers of America required every\nlocal union to establish a safety and health committee. By the mid-1950s,\njoint labour-management safety and health committees had been established in\nmost unionized mines and manufacturing plants and in many other workplaces in\nthe construction and service sector; most union contracts included a section\non safety and health.\n\n### Process of Collective Bargaining\n\nIt is common to think of collective bargaining as a formal process that occurs\nat regular intervals and which results in a written agreement between the\nworkers\u2019 organization and the employer or employers. This kind of bargaining\npresupposes a succession of demands or proposals, counterproposals and\nextended deliberations. The process can produce a variety of results: a\ncollective bargaining contract, letters of understanding, joint declarations\nor mutually agreed codes of practice.\n\nHowever, collective bargaining can also be understood as a continuous process\nfor solving problems as they arise. This kind of collective bargaining occurs\nevery time a shop steward meets with an area supervisor to settle a dispute or\ngrievance, every time a joint safety and health committee meets to discuss\nproblems in the plant, every time a joint union-management team considers a\nnew company programme.\n\nIt is this flexibility of collective bargaining which helps ensure its\ncontinued viability. There is, however, one precondition for formal or\ninformal bargaining: for negotiations to be a success, the representatives of\nboth sides must have the authority to bargain and to strike a deal that is\nmeant to be honoured.\n\nCollective bargaining is sometimes seen as a test of strength, in which a gain\nfor one side is a loss for the other. A wage increase, for example, is seen as\na threat to profits. A no-layoff agreement is seen as limiting management\u2019s\nflexibility. If bargaining is seen as a contest, it follows that the most\nimportant determinant of the final outcome is the relative power of the\nparties. For the workers\u2019 organization, this means the ability to halt\nproduction through a strike, organize a boycott of the employer\u2019s product or\nservice or bring some other form of pressure to bear, while maintaining the\nloyalty of the organization\u2019s members. For an employer, power means the\nability to resist such pressures, replace the striking workers in countries\nwhere this is permitted or hold out until hardship forces workers back to the\njob under management\u2019s conditions.\n\nOf course, the vast majority of labour negotiations end successfully, without\na work stoppage. Nevertheless, it is the threat of one that leads both sides\nto seek a settlement. This kind of negotiation is sometimes called positional\nbargaining, because it begins with each side taking a position, after which\nboth sides move by increments until a compromise is reached, based on their\nrelative strengths.\n\nA second model of collective bargaining describes it as a mutual search for an\noptimum solution (Fisher and Ury 1981). This kind of bargaining assumes that a\nproper agreement can lead to gains for both parties. A wage increase, for\nexample, can be offset by greater productivity. A no-layoff agreement can\nencourage workers to improve efficiency, since their jobs will not be\nthreatened as a result. Such bargaining is sometimes called \u201cmutual gains\u201d or\n\u201cwin-win\u201d bargaining. What is most important is the ability of each side to\nunderstand the interests of the other and to find solutions that maximize\nboth. Occupational safety and health is frequently seen as an ideal subject\nfor mutual gains bargaining, since both sides are interested in avoiding\noccupational accidents and disease.\n\nIn practice, these models of bargaining are not mutually exclusive and both\nare important. Skilled bargainers will always seek to understand their\ncounterparts and search for areas where both sides can benefit from a wise\nagreement. However, it is unlikely that a party without power will accomplish\nits objectives. There will always remain areas where the parties perceive\ntheir interests to be different. Good faith negotiation works best when both\nsides fear the alternative.\n\nPower is important even in negotiations over safety and health. An enterprise\nmay be less interested in reducing the accident rate if it can externalize the\ncost of the accidents. If injured workers can be replaced easily and cheaply,\nwithout substantial compensation, management may be tempted to avoid expensive\nsafety improvements. This is especially true in the case of occupational\ndiseases with long latency periods, where cost of controls is paid when the\ncontrols are installed, while the benefits may not accrue for many years. As a\nresult, a workers\u2019 organization is more likely to succeed if workers have the\npower to stop production or to call a government inspector if the parties fail\nto negotiate a solution.\n\n### Legal Framework\n\nILO Conventions on freedom of association, on protection of the rights to\norganize and to engage in collective bargaining and the ILO Conventions and\nRecommendations on occupational safety and health recognize the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. While these instruments provide an international\nframework, workers\u2019 rights can be assured only through national law and\nregulation.\n\nOf course, the legal basis for collective bargaining, the level at which\nbargaining occurs and even the process of bargaining all vary by country. The\nlegislation of most industrialized countries includes a system for regulating\ncollective bargaining. Even within Europe, the degree of regulation can differ\nwidely, from a minimal approach in Germany to a much more developed one in\nFrance. The legal effect of a collective agreement also varies. In most\ncountries an agreement is legally enforceable; in the United Kingdom, however,\nagreements are seen as informal, to be applied by virtue of the parties\u2019 good\nfaith backed up by the threat of a work stoppage. It is expected that this\nvariability within Europe will diminish as a result of greater European\nunification.\n\nThe level of bargaining also varies. The United States, Japan and most Latin\nAmerican countries feature bargaining at the level of the individual\nenterprise, although unions often attempt to negotiate \u201cpattern\u201d agreements\nwith all the major employers in a given sector. At the other extreme, Austria,\nBelgium and the Nordic countries tend to have highly centralized bargaining in\nwhich most workplaces are subject to a framework agreement negotiated between\nnational federations representing unions and employers. Sectoral agreements\ncovering particular industries or occupations are common in some countries\nsuch as Germany and France.\n\nFrench-speaking African countries tend to follow the example of France and\nbargain by industry. Some English-speaking developing countries also bargain\nby industry. In others, multiple trade unions bargain on behalf of different\ngroups of workers in a single enterprise.\n\nThe level of bargaining partially determines the coverage of collective\nagreements. In France and Germany, for example, collective agreements are\nusually extended to cover everyone coming within the scope of the occupation\nor industry to which the agreement applies. On the other hand, in the United\nStates and other countries with enterprise-level bargaining, collective\nagreements cover only those workplaces where the union has been recognized as\nthe bargaining agent.\n\nAn even more important factor in determining the coverage of collective\nbargaining is whether national law facilitates or impedes unionization and\ncollective bargaining. For example, public sector employees are not permitted\nto bargain collectively in some countries. In others, public sector unions are\ngrowing rapidly. As a result of such factors, the percentage of workers\ncovered by collective agreements varies from a high of almost 90 per cent in\nGermany and the Nordic countries to under 10 per cent in many developing\ncountries.\n\nThe legal framework also affects how collective bargaining applies to\noccupational safety and health. For example, the United States Occupational\nSafety and Health Act gives workers\u2019 organizations the right to information on\ndangerous chemicals and other hazards in the plant, the right to accompany a\nworkplace inspector and a limited right to participate in legal cases brought\nby the Government against an employer for a violation of standards.\n\nMany countries go further. Most industrialized countries require most\nenterprises to establish joint safety and health committees. The Canadian\nProvince of Ontario requires that certified safety and health representatives\nbe chosen by the workers in most workplaces and given a standard course of\ntraining at employer expense. The Swedish Work Environment Act requires the\nappointment of safety delegates by the local trade union organization. Swedish\nsafety delegates have broad rights to information and consultation. Most\nimportant, they have the power to suspend dangerous work pending a review by\nthe Swedish Labour Inspectorate.\n\nThese laws strengthen the collective bargaining process on issues of safety\nand health. Mandatory joint safety committees provide a routine mechanism for\nnegotiation. Training gives union representatives the knowledge they need to\nparticipate effectively. The right to suspend dangerous work helps keep both\nparties focused on eliminating the source of danger.\n\n### Contract and Labour Law Enforcement\n\nOf course, labour agreements are of limited value without an enforcement\nmechanism. A strike is one method by which a workers\u2019 organization can respond\nto an alleged violation by the employer; conversely, the employer can engage\nin a lockout, denying employment to members of the workers\u2019 organization until\nthe dispute is resolved. However, most labour agreements in developed\ncountries rely on less disruptive methods of enforcement. In fact, many labour\nagreements bar strikes or lockouts during the life of the agreement (no-strike\nclauses or peace obligations). Some restrict them to a limited set of\ncircumstances; for example, the contracts negotiated in the United States\nbetween the United Automobile Workers and the major auto companies allow\nstrikes over unsafe working conditions, but not over wages or benefits during\nthe term of the agreement.\n\nA common enforcement mechanism in developed countries is a system of\narbitration, in which disputes are referred to an impartial referee chosen\njointly by the employer and the workers\u2019 organization. In some cases, disputes\nmay be resolved by the judicial system, either in the regular courts or in\nspecial labour courts or boards. In the United States, for example, a dispute\nover contract interpretation usually will go to arbitration. However, if the\nlosing side refuses to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the winning side\ncan seek to have the decision enforced by the courts. A quasi-judicial body in\nthe United States, the National Labor Relations Board, hears complaints\nconcerning unfair labour practices, such as the failure of one side to bargain\nin good faith. In many other countries, labour courts fulfil this role.\n\n### Collective Bargaining Today\n\nCollective bargaining is a dynamic process in all industrial relations systems\nwhere it is practised. The situation in Europe is changing rapidly. The Nordic\ncountries are characterized by comprehensive working environment agreements\nnegotiated on a national basis, integrated with highly developed national\nlaws. Unionization is very high; labour agreements and the law establish joint\ncommittees and worker safety representatives in most workplaces. Collective\nbargaining mechanisms for safety and health and unionization rates, are less\nextensive in other European countries. Member States of the European Union\nface the task of harmonizing national laws under the Single European Act and\nthe Framework Directive on safety and health (Hecker 1993). European trade\nunions are seeking to coordinate their efforts, primarily through the European\nTrade Union Confederation. There are some signs that national bargaining\nultimately will be replaced or, more likely, supplemented by agreements at the\nEuropean level, although employer resistance to this is high. The first\nexample of such Europe-wide bargaining was over parental leave. In the area of\nsafety and health, the GMB union in the United Kingdom has proposed an\nambitious Europe-wide Work Environment Fund, based on similar funds in the\nNordic Countries.\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, are\nchanging even more rapidly. Safety and health regulations were extensive under\nCommunism, but rarely enforced. Trade unions existed, but only under the\ncontrol of the Communist Party. At the enterprise level, unions functioned as\nworkplace labour relations departments, under the control of management,\nwithout any sort of bipartite negotiation. Newly formed independent unions\nhelped precipitate the fall of Communism; sometimes their issues concerned\nworking conditions or such basic sanitary measures as the provision of soap in\ncoal mine wash houses. Today, the old unions are gone or are struggling to\nreconstitute themselves. The new independent unions are attempting to change\nfrom political organizations confronting the government, to collective\nbargaining organizations representing their members in the workplace. Bad and\noften deteriorating working conditions will continue to be an important issue.\n\nThe Japanese system of worker participation, continuous improvement and\nextensive training effectively promotes safety and health, but only where\nsafety and health are explicit goals of the enterprise. Most Japanese unions\nexist only at the enterprise level; negotiations take place through a system\nof continuous joint consultation (Inohara 1990). Joint safety and health\ncommittees are established by the Labour Safety and Sanitation Law of 1972, as\namended.\n\nLabour agreements in the United States contain relatively extensive safety and\nhealth articles for two reasons. First, safety and health is an important\nissue for North American unions, as it is for workers\u2019 organizations in all\nindustrialized countries. However, safety and health laws in the United States\nlack many of the provisions found in the laws of other countries, forcing\nunions to bargain for rights and protections guaranteed elsewhere by law. For\nexample, joint union-management safety and health committees are generally\nrecognized as an important mechanism for day-to-day cooperation and\nnegotiation between workers and employers. However, there is no requirement in\nthe US Occupational Safety and Health Act for such committees. As a result,\nunions must bargain for them. And since the rate of unionization is low in the\nUnited States, most workers do not have access to joint committees. Many\nunions in the United States also have negotiated contract clauses barring\nretaliation against workers who refuse to work under abnormally hazardous\nconditions, since legal protections are weak and uncertain.\n\nCanadian law varies from province to province, although it is generally\nstronger than in the United States. For example, unions in Canada do not need\nto negotiate for the existence of safety and health committees, although they\nmay negotiate for larger ones, with more powers. Safety and health committees\nare also required under Mexican law.\n\nThe situation in developing countries is mixed. Workers\u2019 organizations in\ndeveloping countries like India, Brazil and Zimbabwe place a growing emphasis\non safety and health through agitation for improved laws and through\ncollective bargaining. For example, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has\nfought to extend the national labour code, including its safety and health\nprovisions, to the country\u2019s export processing zones (see box). But trade\nunions are severely restricted or suppressed in many parts of the world and\nthe vast majority of workers in developing countries do not belong to any\nworkers\u2019 organization or benefit from collective bargaining.\n\n#### Trade Union Action in Zimbabwe\n\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), has launched a National Campaign\nfor the Rights of Injured Workers, which combines national level and shop\nfloor action to seek amended laws and improved collective agreements.\n\nZimbabwean law has since 1990 provided for safety committees, health and\nsafety representatives and health and safety supervisors at all workplaces.\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has insisted that worker health and\nsafety representatives must be elected by workers. Its National Campaign\ncovers these demands:\n\n1\\. Safe work. This involves identification of workplace hazards through\nsurveys and accident investigation, as well as negotiating to improve\nconditions.\n\n2\\. Worker and union participation in workers\u2019 health issues. This includes\nthe rights of workers to elect their own health and safety representatives, to\nobtain information such as safety data sheets and factory inspector\u2019s reports,\nand jointly to investigate and report accidents and injuries (as in Sweden).\n\n3\\. Adequate compensation and care for injured workers. This extends to a\nreview of compensation levels.\n\n4\\. Job security for injured workers. Trade union representatives have\nnegotiated a right to return to work and be assisted in placement.\n\nFor the ZCTU, a key step in accident prevention has been its training\nprogramme to increase effective worker participation in health and safety at\nthe shop floor level. The training for worker representatives has been in\ncarrying out walk-through surveys at workplaces and in reporting on any\nhazards identified \u2013 first to workers and then to management for discussion.\nOnce in operation, union health and safety representatives have been involved\nin inspections and in ensuring that injuries are reported. This is\nparticularly important in sectors that would otherwise be inaccessible, such\nas agriculture.\n\nThe ZCTU has also demanded an increase in penalties that may be imposed on\nemployers found to have infringed health and safety laws.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Loewenson 1992).  \n  \n---  \n  \n### The Future of Collective Bargaining\n\nWorkers\u2019 organizations and collective bargaining face difficult challenges in\nthe years ahead. Virtually all collective bargaining takes place at the\nenterprise, industry or national level. In contrast, the economy is\nincreasingly global. Apart from Europe, however, workers\u2019 organizations have\nyet to develop effective mechanisms for bargaining across national boundaries.\nSuch bargaining is a top priority for international labour federations. It can\nbest be promoted through stronger and more effective international union\nstructures, strong social clauses in world trade agreements and appropriate\ninternational instruments, such as those of the International Labour\nOrganization. For example, the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Multinational\nEnterprises refers specifically to both collective bargaining and occupational\nsafety and health. Many unions are developing direct links with their\ncounterparts in other countries in order to coordinate their bargaining and\nprovide mutual assistance. One example is the relationship between mining\nunions in the United States and Colombia (Zinn 1995).\n\nRapid changes in technology and work organization can overwhelm existing\nlabour agreements. Workers\u2019 organizations are attempting to develop a form of\ncontinuous bargaining to respond to workplace change. Workers\u2019 organizations\nhave long recognized the links between the working environment and the\nexternal environment. Some unions have begun to address issues of the external\nenvironment in their collective bargaining agreements and in their membership\neducation programmes. An example is the Model Environment Agreement proposed\nby the Manufacturing-Science-Finance (MSF) Union in the United Kingdom.\n\nA fundamental purpose of trade unions is to take human rights and human\nwelfare out of economic competition \u2013 to prevent an enterprise or a nation\nfrom seeking a competitive advantage by impoverishing its workers and forcing\nthem to work under dangerous conditions. Collective bargaining is vital to\nsafety and health. However, workers\u2019 organizations are essential to collective\nbargaining and workers\u2019 organizations are under attack in many developed and\ndeveloping countries. The survival and growth of workers\u2019 organizations will\nlargely determine whether most workers enjoy rising living standards and\nimproved working conditions, or face a deteriorating cycle of poverty, injury\nand disease.\n\n## NATIONAL LEVEL TRIPARTITE AND BIPARTITE COOPERATION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nRobert Husbands\n\nCooperation between workers, employers and government in the elaboration and\nimplementation of occupational health and safety measures at the national or\nregional level is common in a significant number of countries. It is not\nunusual for interest groups and technical experts also to be involved in this\nprocess. Such cooperation is highly developed and has been institutionalized\nin a number of countries by the establishment of consultative and\ncollaborative organizations. These organizations have normally been widely\naccepted by all labour market participants as there appears to be a general\nconsensus that health and safety at work is a subject of common concern where\ndialogue between the social partners, the government and other interested\nparties is extremely important.\n\nThe institutions which have been established to facilitate this cooperation\nvary significantly in form. One approach is to establish consultative\norganizations either on an ad hoc or a permanent basis to give advice to the\ngovernment on questions of occupational safety and health policy. The\ngovernment is normally not obligated to follow the recommendations offered,\nbut in practice they are difficult to ignore and are frequently taken into\nconsideration in the elaboration of government policy.\n\nThe other approach is to have the social partners and other interested parties\nactively cooperate with the government in public institutions which have been\nestablished to implement occupational safety and health policy. Participation\nby non-governmental actors in public institutions with responsibility for\nhealth and safety questions at work is normally undertaken through the\nrepresentation of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and, in some cases,\nother parties, on the board of directors of the public institution concerned,\nalthough sometimes participation extends to the management and even the\nproject level. In most cases these persons are nominated by the government on\nrecommendation of the parties to be represented, although in some cases\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the right to directly nominate\ntheir representatives to these collaborative institutions. Bodies at the\nnational level (or regional, state or provincial level) are normally\ncomplemented by structures or arrangements at the industry, enterprise and\nplant level.\n\n### Advice on Policy and Standard Setting\n\nProbably the most common form of cooperation involves the establishment of\nconsultative organizations to give advice on policy and standard setting.\nExamples of this can vary between a modest approach, which involves the\nexpenditure of relatively few resources, to more institutionalized approaches,\nwhich involve more significant amounts of resources. The United States is an\nexample of a country where a more limited approach has been adopted. At the\nfederal level, the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and\nHealth, established pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of\n1970, is the principal permanent advisory committee. This committee, according\nto the Act, is to be composed of representatives of management, labor,\noccupational safety and health professionals and the public, with a member of\nthe public acting as the chairperson. The committee makes recommendations to\nthe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In\npractice, however, this committee has not met frequently. The members of the\ncommittee are not compensated and the Secretary of Labor has provided from its\nbudget an executive secretary and other support services as needed. The costs\nof maintaining this committee in existence are therefore very low, although\nbudgetary constraints now call even this support into question. A permanent\ncommittee of a similar character, the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational\nSafety and Health, was established in July 1971 pursuant to Executive Order\n11612 to advise the Secretary of Labour on matters relating to the safety and\nhealth of federal workers.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 also provides for the\nestablishment of ad hoc advisory committees to assist in standard-setting\nfunctions. These advisory committees are appointed by the Secretary of Labor\nand are to consist of no more than 15 members, including one or more persons\nwho are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Each\nstandard-setting committee is to include an equal number of representatives of\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. The Secretary of Labor may also appoint\none or more representatives of state health and safety agencies, as well as\ntechnical experts who could be, for example, representatives of professional\norganizations of technicians or professionals specializing in occupational\nhealth or safety, or of nationally recognized standards-producing\norganizations. Extensive use has been made of such standard-setting\ncommittees, which are sometimes in existence several years to accomplish the\nwork that has been assigned to them. Meetings can be frequent, depending on\nthe nature of the tasks to be performed. Although committee members are\nnormally not paid, they are normally reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses\nand support services for the activity of these committees have been paid for\nby the Department of Labor as well in the past. Committees have been\nconstituted to recommend standards with respect to agriculture, asbestos dust,\ncarcinogens, coke oven emissions, cutaneous hazards, hazardous materials\nlabelling, heat stress, marine terminal facilities, noise, longshoring safety\nand health, shipyard employment standards and steel erection rules, among\nother things.\n\nOther ad hoc advisory committees of a similar character have been established\npursuant to similar legislation which falls under the authority of the\nSecretary of Labor. For example, a number of standard-setting committees have\nbeen established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\nThe costs involved in the establishment of such standard-setting committees,\nhowever, are relatively modest and are characterized by relatively low\nadministrative costs, little infrastructure, voluntary participation by\noutside parties without compensation and dissolution of the committees upon\ncompletion of their tasks.\n\nMore elaborate institutionalized forms of consultation are, however, found in\nother countries. In the Netherlands, for example, the pre-eminent organization\nis the Working Environment Council, which was established pursuant to the\nWorking Environmental Council Act 1990. The Council gives its views to the\nMinistry of Social Affairs and Employment, either when asked or on its own\ninitiative, comments on proposed new acts and decrees and can bring forward\nits own proposals for new policy or legislation. The Council also gives its\nviews about the advisability of making grants-in-aid for research on working\nenvironment issues, about the issuance of exemptions, the formulation of\ngovernment guidance and the policy of the Labour Inspectorate. The Council is\ncomprised of eight representatives from central employers\u2019 organizations,\neight from central workers\u2019 organizations and seven from governmental bodies.\nOnly the representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the\nright to vote, however, and the chairperson of the Council is independent. The\nCouncil meets every month. In addition, the Council has approximately 15\ndifferent working committees for specific issues and, in addition, ad hoc\nworking groups are established for detailed subjects when the subject matter\njustifies it. Within the working committees and working groups, external\nexperts play an important role and these working organizations prepare reports\nand papers which are discussed at Council meetings and often form the basis\nfor positions which are subsequently taken. The recommendations of the Council\nare comprehensive and are published. Although normally the parties try to\nachieve a consensus position, separate views can be expressed to the Minister\nof Social Affairs and Employment when employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives\ncannot find common ground. More than 100 persons are involved in the work of\nthe Council and its subsidiary organizations and thus it is supported by\nsignificant financial and administrative resources.\n\nOther less prominent consultative organizations exist in the Netherlands for\nmore specific occupational safety and health issues. These include the\nFoundation for the Working Environment in Building Construction, the\nFoundation for Health Care in Agriculture, the Commission for the Prevention\nof Disasters by Dangerous Substances and the Commission for the Labour\nInspectorate and Enforcement Policy.\n\nExamples of other countries which have consultative organizations of a\nbipartite, tripartite or multipartite character to give recommendations on\noccupational safety and health policy and standards include: Canada (ad hoc\ncommittees on legislative reform and standard setting \u2013 federal level; Forum\nfor Action on Workplace Health and Safety \u2013 Alberta; Joint Steering Committee\non Hazardous Substances in the Workplace \u2013 Ontario; Back Injury Prevention\nAdvisory Committee \u2013 Newfoundland; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013\nPrince Edward Island; Advisory Council on Workplace Safety and Health \u2013\nManitoba; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013 Saskatchewan; Logging\nSafety Forum \u2013 British Columbia); Denmark (Working Environment Council);\nFrance (the Central Council for the Prevention of Occupational Risks and the\nNational Commission of Occupational Health and Safety in Agriculture); Italy\n(Permanent Consultative Commission for the Prevention of Work Accidents and\nOccupational Health); Germany (Advisory Board to the Federal Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health); and Spain (General Council of the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health).\n\n### Policy Implementation\n\nA number of countries have bipartite, tripartite or multipartite organizations\nwhich are also active in policy implementation. These collaborative\norganizations normally are public establishments which incorporate\nrepresentatives of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and in some cases\nother persons or interest groups, in both policy making and policy\nimplementation. Normally far larger than advisory committees, councils or\ncommissions, these collaborative organizations have responsibility for\nimplementing government policy, frequently manage large budgetary resources\nand often have significant numbers of personnel.\n\nAn example of such an organization is the Health and Safety Commission in\nGreat Britain. The Commission was established pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Health and Safety Act 1974. It has as its mandate to ensure that adequate\nmeasures are taken to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons at\nwork; to protect the public against risks to health and safety arising out of\nwork; to control storage and use of explosives, highly flammable materials and\nother dangerous substances; and to control the emission of noxious or\noffensive substances from the workplace. It is responsible to the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment, but also to other Secretaries of State,\nincluding those of Trade and Industry, Transport, Environment and Agriculture.\nThe Commission has nine persons, all of whom are appointed by the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment. It consists of a chairperson, three\nmembers appointed after consultation with the principal central employers\u2019\norganization, three members appointed after consultation with the principal\ncentral workers\u2019 organization and two members appointed after consultation\nwith local authority associations.\n\nThe Commission is assisted by a number of subsidiary organizations (figure\n21.3). The most important of these is the Health and Safety Executive, a\ndistinct statutory body which consists of a governing body of three persons\nappointed by the Commission with the approval of the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Employment. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for\ncarrying out the substantive work of the Commission, including the enforcement\nof health and safety standards under the Health and Safety Act 1974 and other\nfunctions delegated to it by the Commission. Local authorities also perform\nenforcement functions with respect to certain health and safety legislation as\nwell. In addition, the Commission is assisted in its work by a number of\nadvisory committees which are, depending on the committee, bipartite,\ntripartite or multipartite in character. These advisory committees are\norganized both by subject matter and industry. There are advisory committees\nfor each of the following subjects: toxic substances, dangerous pathogens,\ndangerous substances, genetic modifications, occupational health, releases to\nthe environment, nuclear installations and ionizing radiation. There are also\nadvisory committees for the following industries: agriculture, ceramics,\nconstruction, education, foundries, health, petroleum, paper and board,\nprinting, railways, rubber, cotton and textiles. Subject matter committees\ntend to have between 12 and 18 members plus a chairperson and are multipartite\nin character, frequently including technical experts as well as\nrepresentatives of central workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations, government\nand other interest groups. Industry committees, however, tend to be bipartite,\nwith approximately 12 members drawn in equal numbers from central workers\u2019 and\nemployers\u2019 organizations and with the chairperson being from the government.\nThe resources at the disposition of the Commission and the Health and Safety\nExecutive are substantial. For example, in 1993 these organizations together\nhad approximately 4,538 staff members and a budget of \u00a3 211.8 million.\n\n#### Figure 21.3 Health & safety in Great Britain: the main institutions\n\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel03fe.gif)\n\nOther examples of collaborative organizations in this field can be found in\nCanada. At the federal level, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and\nSafety is Canada\u2019s main resource for information on this topic. The Centre\nalso promotes health and safety in the workplace, facilitates the\nestablishment of high standards of occupational health and safety and assists\nin the development of programmes and policies to reduce or eliminate\noccupational hazards. The Centre, created by an act of parliament in 1978, was\ngiven a tripartite governing body to ensure its impartiality in occupational\nhealth and safety matters, including being an unbiased source of information.\nIts governing council consists of a chairperson and 12 governors \u2013 four\nrepresenting the federal, provincial and territorial governments; four\nrepresenting labour; and four representing employers. The Centre manages\nsignificant human and financial resources and its total expenditures in 1993\nwere approximately C$8.3 million.\n\nIn some provinces there are also collaborative organizations. In Quebec, two\nprominent organizations are the Commission for Occupational Health and Safety\nand the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research. The Commission\nhas two functions. The first is to develop and implement occupational health\nand safety policy, including the establishment of standards and their\nenforcement; the provision of support for the implementation of prevention\nprogrammes, participation mechanisms and health services; and the provision of\ntraining, information and research services. The second is to provide payment\nto workers injured on the job and to manage an insurance fund for this purpose\nto which employers must contribute. The Commission, which was established by\nlaw in 1981 and which succeeded the Commission of Occupational Accidents\nfounded in 1931, has a bipartite board of directors which is composed of seven\nworkers\u2019 representatives, seven representatives of employers and a\nchairperson. The representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations are\nchosen from lists supplied by the most representative labour and employer\norganizations. The Commission manages large human and financial resources and\nat the end of 1992 had expenditures of C$2,151.7 million and employed 3,013\npersons as permanent staff and 652 as casual employees.\n\nQuebec\u2019s Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research, founded in\n1980, has as its mandate to contribute, through scientific research, to the\nidentification and the elimination of sources of workplace hazards, as well as\nto the readaptation of workers who have suffered workplace injuries. The board\nof directors of the Institute is the same as that of the Commission for\nOccupational Health and Safety, notwithstanding that it is an independent\ninstitution. The Institute also has a scientific council which has advisory\nfunctions and is composed of four representatives of workers\u2019 organizations,\nfour from employers\u2019 organizations, six representatives of the scientific and\ntechnical community and the Institute\u2019s Director General. In 1992, the\nInstitute had expenditures of C$17.9 million and approximately 126 employees.\n\nThe Ontario Workplace Health and Safety Agency, established in 1990 by\namendment of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, also has responsibility\nfor developing and implementing policy and for managing occupational health\nand safety programmes in Ontario. The governing body of the organization\nconsists of a bipartite board of 18 persons with nine representatives each\nfrom workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. Of these representatives, one\nrepresentative of labour and one of management serve as joint chief executive\nofficers. The resources of this organization are substantial \u2013 total\nexpenditures amounted to C$64.9 million in 1992.\n\nOne country with a long tradition of collaborative organizations in the field\nof occupational safety and health, Sweden, decided to reject this form of\norganization in 1992 and has subsequently used advisory organizations instead.\nIt should be added that this decision was not confined to occupational safety\nand health, but included all collaborative organizations of any kind in which\nrepresentatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations played a decision-\nmaking role at the national level. The impetus for this change came from the\nprincipal employers\u2019 organization, which decided unilaterally to withdraw from\nparticipation in collaborative public institutions. The central employers\u2019\norganization argued that interest groups should not have political\nresponsibility in terms of managing public institutions, but that the\ngovernment and parliament should have this political role and responsibility;\nthat the role of the employers\u2019 organization was to represent its members\u2019\ninterests, and that this role could be in conflict with a duty to serve the\ninterests of the public institutions if the employers\u2019 organization was\nrepresented on the governing boards of such institutions; and that\nparticipation weakened democracy and the development of public institutions.\nAlthough workers\u2019 organizations were not in agreement with the employers\u2019\norganizations on these points, the government concluded that collaborative\nbodies with no representation from the principal employers\u2019 organization were\nimpractical and decided to have representation by workers\u2019 and employers\u2019\norganizations as well as other interest groups only on advisory bodies. Hence,\norganizations in the field of occupational safety and health such as the\nNational Board of Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of\nOccupational Health and the Working Life Fund, which had formerly been\ncollaborative in character in terms of a tripartite or multipartite governing\nboard, were restructured.\n\nAlthough collaborative organizations in most countries are more rare than\nadvisory organizations, which are quite widespread, the case of Sweden\u2019s\nrejection of collaborative institutions, at least in the field of occupational\nsafety and health, appears to be an isolated one. Although some collaborative\ninstitutions, dealing notably with questions of economic policy, training and\nemployment, were dismantled in Great Britain during the 1980s and 1990s by\nsuccessive conservative governments, the Health and Safety Commission was not\naffected. Some have advanced that this is because occupational safety and\nhealth is a subject of common concern to employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations\nas well as the government and other interested parties and therefore there is\na strong interest by all parties in finding a consensus in both policy\nformulation and implementation. Also, in Canada such collaborative\ninstitutions have been created at both the federal level and in some provinces\nprecisely because a collaborative approach was deemed more useful in finding a\nconsensus between the labour market parties and because administration of the\noccupational safety and health laws would appear more impartial and fair to\nthose affected by them.\n\nOn a broader level, however, there are two national consultative bodies which\nare also concerned with occupational safety and health issues as part of their\nmore general mandate to address all important social and economic questions of\nnational importance. In the Netherlands, the Labour Foundation, established in\nMay 1945, is a bipartite organization jointly managed by equal numbers of\nrepresentatives from central employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations (including\nfarmers) and has a significant role as an advisory body to the Government.\nAlthough historically its main function has concerned questions of wage\npolicy, it also expresses its views on other conditions of work. The other\nnational consultative body of importance is the Social and Economic Council,\nwhich was founded in 1950 pursuant to the Act on Statutory Trade Associations.\nThe tripartite Council consists of 15 representatives of central employers\u2019\norganizations, 15 representatives of central workers\u2019 organizations and 15\nindependent experts. The employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives are appointed\nby their organizations and the independent experts are appointed by the Crown.\nIn making its appointments, the Crown also tries to have a balance between the\nmajor political parties. The Council is independent of the government and is\nfinanced by a mandatory tax on employers.\n\nThe Council has a multimillion dollar budget and its own Secretariat. The\nCouncil normally meets once a month and is assisted by a number of permanent\nand ad hoc committees, which are frequently also constituted on a tripartite\nbasis. The government is required by law to submit all proposals for social\nand economic legislation to the Council for its advice and any labour\nlegislation \u2013 which would include proposals concerning occupational safety and\nhealth \u2013 comes before the Council.\n\nIt should be added that a number of countries require that workplace health\nand safety committees should or may be established for enterprises which have\nmore than a certain number of employees. These committees are bipartite in\nnature and include representatives of the employers and the workers. These\ncommittees normally have as their function to investigate and propose all ways\nand means of actively contributing to measures undertaken to ensure the best\npossible health and safety conditions in the establishment, a role which can\ninclude the promotion and monitoring of health and safety conditions in the\nenterprise to ensure, among other things, adherence to applicable law and\nregulations. These joint committees are normally advisory in character.\nWorkplace health and safety committees, for example, are legally required in\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.\n\n## FORMS OF WORKERS\u2019 PARTICIPATION\n\nMuneto Ozaki and Anne Trebilcock\n\nThe phrase workers\u2019 participation is used loosely to encompass various forms\nof workers\u2019 participation in decision making, usually at the enterprise level.\nThey complement other forms that may exist at the industrial or sectoral level\nand the national level, such as bodies for tripartite cooperation. The types\nof workers\u2019 participation arrangement differ widely with regard to their\nfunctions and powers, ranging from informal individual employee suggestion\nschemes to co-determination of certain matters by workers\u2019 representatives\ntogether with management. The mechanisms used for encouraging employee\nparticipation vary so widely that it is impossible to review them fully here.\nThe main forms that have attracted recent interest, particularly in the field\nof work organization, are reviewed below; to these could be added the\nhistorical example of self-management by workers in former Yugoslavia. As\nparticularly relevant today, joint safety and health committees are examined\nas a special form of workers\u2019 participation within the larger labour relations\ncontext.\n\nThe idea of workers\u2019 participation arose in Europe, where collective\nbargaining has usually been at the branch or industry level; this often left a\ngap of employee representation at the enterprise or plant level, which became\nfilled by bodies such as works councils, works committees, enterprise\ncommittees and so forth. Many developing countries have also adopted\nlegislative initiatives with a view to having works councils or similar\nstructures set up (e.g., Pakistan, Thailand, Zimbabwe) as a means of promoting\nlabour-management cooperation. The relationship of these bodies to trade\nunions and collective bargaining has been the subject of considerable\nlegislation and negotiation. This is reflected in a provision of the ILO\nWorkers\u2019 Representatives Convention, 1971 (No. 135), which states that where\nboth trade union representatives and elected representatives exist in the same\nundertaking, measures shall be taken to ensure that the existence of those\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade union\n(Article 5).\n\n### Direct Participation\n\nWorkers may participate in decision making either directly themselves or\nindirectly through their representatives \u2013 trade unions or elected employee\nrepresentatives. Since the 1980s, there has been a spread of direct\nparticipation by workers, if the term participation is understood as the\nexercise of any influence on their work or how it is to be carried out. Thus\nworkers may \u201cparticipate\u201d in work-related decisions not only when there is an\ninstitution, such as a quality circle, at the workplace. Accordingly, a simple\nexercise of work enrichment may be a form of promoting direct participation of\nworkers.\n\nDirect participation may be on an individual basis \u2013 for example, through\nsuggestion schemes or \u201cenriched\u201d work. It may also be on a group basis \u2013 for\nexample, in quality circles or similar small-group activities. Teamwork in\nitself constitutes a form of group-based direct participation. Direct\nparticipation may be integrated into decisions about daily work, or it may\ntake place outside daily work, such as in a voluntary quality circle that cuts\nacross the group structure habitually used. Direct participation may also be\n\u201cconsultative\u201d or \u201cdeliberative\u201d; research by the European Foundation for the\nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions has explored this particular\naspect in some detail (Regalia and Gill 1996). With consultative\nparticipation, employees are encouraged and enabled, either as individuals or\nmembers of a group, to make their views known, but it is up to management to\naccept or reject their proposals. Deliberative participation, on the other\nhand, places some of traditional management responsibility in the employees\u2019\nhands, as in the case of teamworking or semi-autonomous work groups wherein\nsome authority has been delegated to the workers.\n\n### Works Councils and Similar Structures; Co-determination\n\nThe term works councils describes arrangements for the representation of\nemployees, usually at the plant level although they also exist at higher\nlevels (company, group of companies, industry, European Union). The\nrelationship to trade unions is often delineated by legislation or clarified\nby collective agreement, but tensions between these institutions sometimes\nremain all the same. Extensive use of works councils, sometimes called\nworkers\u2019 committees, cooperation committees or otherwise, is well established\nin a number of European countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany\nand the Netherlands and, under the impetus of Directive No. 94/45/EC of 1994\non European works councils, can be anticipated to spread in that region for\nlarge enterprises. Several Central and Eastern European countries, such as\nHungary and Poland, have enacted legislation to encourage the emergence of\nworks councils. They are found as well in some countries in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America; part of the post-apartheid labour law reform in South Africa,\nfor instance, included establishing a form of works councils alongside trade\nunion structures.\n\nThe possible powers of works councils are best illustrated by the example of\nGermany, although in some ways it is a unique case. Weiss (1992) describes the\nworks council in that country as the form of institutionalized representation\nof interests for employees within an establishment. A works council enjoys\ncertain rights to information, consultation (as in all countries) and co-\ndetermination (much more rare). As the most far-reaching form of\nparticipation, co-determination covers participation in arrangements on health\nand safety at work and the formal adoption of a reconciliation of interests\nand a \u201csocial plan\u201d in the event of a substantial alteration in the\nestablishment, such as a plant closure. Co-determination rights also extend to\nguidelines for staff selection and appraisal, in-service training and measures\naffecting individual workers such as grading, transfer and dismissal. The\nGerman works council is empowered to conclude works agreements at the\nenterprise level and can initiate complaints where it believes the agreement\nis not being honoured. Included in the areas of obligatory collective co-\ndetermination are accident prevention and health protection, works rules,\nworking time, the fixing of performance-related pay rates, the manner of\npayment, general principles governing holidays and others. On these matters,\nthe employer cannot take action without the works council\u2019s agreement. The\nworks council also has the right to take the initiative and can refer a matter\nto the establishment-level arbitration committee for enforcement. As Weiss\n(1992) characterizes it, the works council\u2019s role is \u201cparticipating in the\n\u2018how\u2019 after the employer has made a decision on the \u2018whether\u2019\u201d. The right to\nconsultation affords the works council a chance to play a part in the\ndecisions made by the employer, but failure to consult will not invalidate the\ndecision. The subjects on which consultation is required include protection\nagainst dismissal, protection against technical hazards, training and\npreparation of a social plan.\n\nThe works council must observe the principles of cooperation with the employer\nand the peace obligation (no work stoppages); it also must cooperate with\ntrade unions present and with the appropriate employers\u2019 organization. Works\ncouncils are bound to conduct their business impartially, without regard to\nrace, religion or creed, nationality, origin, political or union activity, sex\nor age of the employees. The employer provides the facilities for the works\ncouncil, funds it and is liable for its actions.\n\nWorks councils are elected separately for manual and non-manual workers in\nGermany. Special works council elections are held; while there is no legal\nconnection between these representatives and trade union officers in fact,\nthey often coincide. In Austria and Germany, special representation is ensured\nfor disabled workers and young workers and trainees.\n\nWorks council members receive no remuneration for this, but necessarily\nincurred expenses are reimbursed. Members are guaranteed retention of their\npay level and job grading after the term of office has expired and enjoy\nspecial protection against dismissal. They are entitled to release from work\nto conduct works council business and attend training. Such protections are in\nline with the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135), which calls for\nworkers\u2019 representatives in an undertaking to enjoy effective protection\nagainst any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their\nstatus or activities as a workers\u2019 representative (Article 1).\n\nMany countries feature less ambitious works council schemes that provide for\ninformation and consultation rights. Especially where trade unions have little\npresence on the shop floor level, there is considerable interest in\nintroducing works councils or workers\u2019 committees as a means for workers to\nhave a voice at the workplace level.\n\n### Quality Circles and Total Quality Management\n\nQuality circles and other similar group activities were rapidly introduced in\na large number of enterprises in some Western European countries (e.g., the\nUnited Kingdom and France) at the start of the 1980s and in the United States\na little earlier. They built upon \u201cQuality of Working Life\u201d (QWL) or\n\u201cHumanization of Work\u201d programmes that began in the early 1970s. Their spread\nwas considerably later in some other Western countries (e.g., Germany) and\nstill seems to be very limited in countries where joint project groups are the\npredominant means of dealing with work organization, such as Sweden. They were\nstimulated by a belief that Japan\u2019s ability to produce innovative and high-\nquality products at low cost had something to do with the way human resources\nwere managed in that country; quality circles were the most visible and easily\ntransplantable feature of Japanese human resource management. Quality circles\nare generally expected to produce two types of effect: one is the enhancement\nof quality and productivity and the other is the fostering of a sense of\nparticipation in work-related decisions among workers, leading to increased\njob satisfaction and better industrial relations. In Japan the emphasis has\nbeen placed more on the first aspect and in Europe and North America on the\nsecond. There are also structural differences: while circle leaders are\nnormally appointed by management in Japan, they are often elected in Germany.\nToday, the emphasis of QWL programmes is more on enhancing productivity and\ncompetitiveness (Ozaki 1996).\n\nIn some of the countries where quality circles were experimented with widely\nin the 1980s, such as France and the United Kingdom, there has been a certain\ndisenchantment with their relative ineffectiveness in producing the expected\nresults. Many circles disappeared a few years after their creation; many\nothers exist on paper, but are in fact moribund. The failure has been\nattributed to many factors \u2013 their tendency to create confusion in the normal\nlines of command, non-management control over membership, circles\u2019 determining\ntheir own agenda without heed for management priorities, lack of enthusiasm or\nhostility on the part of middle management, absence of durable commitment on\nthe part of top management and restriction of scope to minor work-related\nissues.\n\nRealization of these shortcomings led to the formation of a theory of \u201cTotal\nQuality Management\u201d (TQM). Certain principles of TQM have implications for\nemployee participation: all employees are to participate in the process of\nimproving the business, and responsibility for quality is to be assigned to\npeople who in fact control the quality of what they do. Thus TQM encourages\njob enlargement and enrichment leading to semi-autonomous work groups. It also\npromotes horizontal coordination in a firm through, for example, the use of ad\nhoc, multi-functional or interdepartmental project teams.\n\n### Joint Project Groups\n\nThe practice of establishing joint project groups to study the best ways of\nintroducing technological or organizational changes through the joint efforts\nof managers and workers is a traditional feature of labour relations in some\ncountries, such as Sweden. A joint project group is normally composed of\nmanagers, workplace union representatives and shop-floor workers and often\nassisted by outside experts. The management and the union concerned often\nestablish joint project groups separately on four issues: new technology, work\norganization, training and work environment. The Swedish model of joint\nproject groups presents a notable example of direct participation of shop-\nfloor workers within a framework of established collective labour relations.\nThe system is also found in other countries, such as Germany and Japan.\n\n### Semi-autonomous Group Work and Teamwork\n\nSemi-autonomous group work and teamwork are both forms of on-line direct\nparticipation of shop-floor workers in work-related decisions, unlike the\nabove-mentioned joint project group work, which is a form of off-line\nparticipation. The main difference between the two forms of participation lies\nin the degree of autonomy which the members of the team or group enjoy in\norganizing their work. Semi-autonomous group work was used extensively in\nScandinavia, although recently there has been a move back to a more\ntraditional approach; there have been experiments with it elsewhere in Europe\nas well.\n\nWhile experiments with semi-autonomous group work are generally declining,\nteamwork is spreading fast throughout Western countries. The degree of\nautonomy which a team enjoys varies widely from one company to another. Team\nstructure also differs. In many countries, team leaders are usually appointed\nby management, but in a few countries (e.g., Germany) they are often elected\nby co-workers. Frequently, the creation of teams is accompanied by significant\nchanges in the role of first-line supervisors; they tend to take on greater\nresponsibility for advising team members and for both vertical and horizontal\ncommunication, but lose their supervisory role. Employers have shown\nincreasing interest in teamwork because it tends to facilitate the upgrading\nof workers\u2019 skills and widens the range of workers\u2019 tasks, thus allowing\ngreater flexibility in production processes. However, it is sometimes\ncriticized by workers as a means of inducing them to work harder \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\nby substituting co-workers\u2019 pressure for management control.\n\n### Employee Representation on Supervisory Boards; Employee Shareholding\n\nSome commentators include forms of employee ownership or representation on\ncompany boards as expressions of workers\u2019 participation. In Germany and the\nScandinavian countries, among others, workers have indirect participation\nabove the enterprise level by the inclusion of workers\u2019 representatives on\nsupervisory boards. This involves incorporating workers\u2019 representatives in\nthe traditional company board structure, where they are in a minority\n(although sometimes, as in Germany, a numerous one). It does not necessarily\nimply participation in the active management of the company and the workers\u2019\nrepresentatives have the same status as other board members. This means they\nare to put the interests of the company first and foremost and are bound by\nthe same duty of secrecy as other board members. Holding positions on the\nboard may provide access to additional information, however, and a number of\ntrade unions have sought the right to have workers\u2019 representatives on boards.\nIt is a phenomenon now seen in Eastern and Western Europe and North America,\nbut remains rather rare elsewhere.\n\nAnother expression of workers\u2019 participation is as owners of shares in limited\nliability companies or corporations. Sometimes workers are able to scrape\nenough capital together to purchase a firm that would otherwise be going out\nof business. The rationale behind these situations is that a worker who\nidentifies financially with a company will work harder for its success.\nImportant variables are the form of participation (return on investment rights\nor control rights), its degree (amount and timing of returns) and the reasons\nbehind financial participation. In any event, these practices are largely\nreserved to Europe and North America. If cooperative ventures are considered\npart of this phenomenon, however, the notion of workers being stakeholders in\ntheir work is much more widespread throughout the world. It would be\ninteresting to study whether and to what extent employee ownership of a firm\nor of shares in it has an effect on the workplace safety and health record.\n\n### Health and Safety Committees and Representatives\n\nA specialized form of workers\u2019 participation is seen in the development of\nhealth and safety committees and health and safety representatives (for worker\nparticipation in Denmark, see Box). The legislation of a number of countries\nprovides for the establishment of such committees and for such representatives\n(e.g., Belgium, several provinces of Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,\nSweden). Smaller companies, variously defined, are usually excluded from such\nmandatory measures, but they, like larger units, often set up health and\nsafety committees on their own initiative. In addition, many collective\nbargaining agreements have led to the creation of such committees and to the\ndesignation of health and safety representatives (e.g., in Canada and the\nUnited States).\n\n#### Denmark: Worker Participation in Health and Safety\n\nDanish industrial relations provide an example of a country with a number of\ninstitutions that play a role in relation to health and safety. The main\nfeatures are:\n\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING: Negotiation of agreements by which trade unions and\nemployers fix wages, conditions of work, etc. Pertinent highlights are:\n\nShop stewards who are elected by workers under collective bargaining\nagreements; enjoy statutory protection against dismissal; serve as channel\nbetween workers and management on working conditions.\n\nCollective Agreement on Cooperation and Cooperation Committees provides for\ninformation to be given to individuals and groups of workers in advance so\nthey can make their views known before a decision is taken and for the\nestablishment of cooperation committees.\n\nCooperation committees must be set up in all firms employing more than 35\nworkers (25 in the public service). Joint committees to promote cooperation in\nday-to-day operations; they must be consulted on the introduction of new\ntechnologies and the organization of production; some co-determination rights\non working conditions, training and personal data.\n\nNational collective agreement on industrial disputes (of 1910) gives workers a\nright (rarely exercised) to stop work if considerations of \u201clife, welfare or\nhonour\u201d make this absolutely necessary. Other collective agreements contain\nprovisions on training and trade unions also provide it.\n\nFRAMEWORK LAW: The Working Environment Act creates \u201cthe basis on which the\nundertakings themselves will be able to solve questions relating to safety and\nhealth under the guidance of the employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and\nunder the guidance and supervision of the Labour Inspection Service\u201d (Sec.\n1(b)). The Act establishes a complete system from the plant to the national\nlevel to permit worker participation:\n\nSafety representatives are elected representatives required in firms employing\nat least ten workers; they enjoy the same protection against dismissal and\nretaliation as shop stewards and are entitled to reimbursement of official\nexpenses.\n\nSafety groups: The safety representative and the department supervisor form\nthe safety group. Its functions are to:\n\n\u00b7 monitor working conditions\n\n\u00b7 inspect equipment, tools, materials\n\n\u00b7 report any risk which cannot be avoided immediately\n\n\u00b7 halt production where necessary to avert an imminent serious danger\n\n\u00b7 ensure that work is performed safely and proper instructions are given\n\n\u00b7 investigate industrial accidents and occupational diseases\n\n\u00b7 participate in prevention activities\n\n\u00b7 cooperate with the occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 act as link between workers and the safety committee.\n\nMembers of the safety group are entitled to training and to necessary\ninformation.\n\nSafety Committees are required in firms employing at least 20 workers. In\nfirms with more than two safety groups, the safety committees consist of\nworkers elected from among safety representatives, two supervisor members and\nan employer\u2019s representative.\n\nThe functions are:\n\n\u00b7 planning, directing and coordinating health and safety activities\n\n\u00b7 being consulted on these matters\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with other companies engaged in work at the same workplace\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with the company\u2019s occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 supervising the activity of safety groups\n\n\u00b7 making recommendations on prevention of accidents and diseases.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL involves employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations in\nthe definition and application of preventive policy at the national level.\nComposition: 11 representatives of employee organizations representing manual\nand non-manual workers, one for supervisors, ten of employers\u2019 organizations,\nplus an occupational medical practitioner, a technical expert and non-voting\ngovernmental representatives. Functions:\n\n\u00b7 is consulted on drafting legislation and regulations\n\n\u00b7 may on its own initiative take up a health and safety matter\n\n\u00b7 submits annual recommendations on working environment policy\n\n\u00b7 coordinates the activities of Trade Safety Councils\n\n\u00b7 supervises the activity of the Working Environment Fund.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT FUND is managed by a tripartite board. The Fund has mainly\ninformation and training duties, but also finances research programmes.\n\nTRADE SAFETY COUNCILS: Twelve Trade Safety Councils examine the problems of\ntheir trade or industry and advise undertakings. They are also consulted on\ndraft legislation. Equal representation of employers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019\norganizations on the one hand and workers\u2019 organizations on the other hand.\n\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES: In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Labour\nInspection Service and within it, the Danish Institute of the Working\nEnvironment, provide various types of services and advice in the field of\noccupational safety and health. Collective industrial disputes are heard by\nthe Labour Courts.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Vogel 1994).  \n  \n---  \n  \nOften, collective bargaining agreements will strengthen the legislatively\nguaranteed powers afforded to workers\u2019 safety and health representatives. The\ncommittees and representatives vary in regard to their relationship to trade\nunions and works councils, their election or appointment, their duties and\nfunctions and their impact. As a form of workers\u2019 involvement in the\nspecialized sphere of health and safety, such committees and representatives\ncan be a contributing factor to improving both working conditions and the\nlabour relations climate. They have been most successful when they form an\nintegral part of management\u2019s safety and health programme, have access to\nadequate information, involve rank-and-file workers in their activities to\nhelp ensure continuity and are backed up by effective government labour\ninspection. Where employers maintain occupational health services or have\nsafety experts, a fruitful relationship with them can also promote the success\nof joint health and safety committees. A recent workplace survey in the United\nKingdom, for instance, found that \u201cjoint consultative committees, with all\nemployee representatives appointed by unions, significantly reduced workplace\ninjuries relative to those establishments where the management alone\ndetermines health and safety arrangements\u201d (Reilly, Paci and Holl 1995). They\nalso reported an important role for joint consultative committees where\nemployee representatives were appointed in other ways. However, some research\nalso indicates that joint health and safety committees fall short of the\nexpectations held out for them. The reasons suggested for this differ:\ninsufficient support from management, participants who are not adequately\ninformed or trained, workers not represented forcefully enough and so on.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives may be appointed by management (as\nin many workplaces where no trade union is present), designated by the trade\nunion (as in the United Kingdom) or elected directly by the workers at the\nenterprise or higher level (as in Denmark). A parallel system will be used for\nworker representatives on a joint labour-management health and safety\ncommittee which, while bipartite, will not always have equal representation\nfrom both sides. General institutions for workers\u2019 representation are often\ncomplemented by special representative structures for health and safety (as in\nSpain).\n\nThe mechanism chosen will often reflect the existence of other labour\nrelations institutions in a country: in France, for instance, employee members\nof the joint health, safety and working conditions committees are appointed by\na delegate elected from the works committee and staff representatives; in\nGermany, members designated by the works council will be among those serving\non a joint health and safety committee. Works councils in the Netherlands may\ndelegate their powers to a safety, health and welfare committee. A strong\nlink, if not identity, between trade union representatives and health and\nsafety representatives is usually seen as desirable (as in Quebec (Canada),\nIreland, Norway and Sweden), but where trade union density is low this runs\nthe risk of depriving large numbers of workers of representation rights in\nrelation to health and safety. Speculation that joint health and safety\ncommittees might lead to extending greater workers\u2019 participation to other\nfields has remained largely unfounded.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives normally have the following rights:\nto have access to information on health and safety and the introduction of new\ntechnology, to be consulted on these matters, to be involved in monitoring\nworkplace conditions, to accompany inspectors (sometimes called the\n\u201cwalkaround right\u201d), to be involved in accident investigations and to make\nrecommendations to management on the improvement of working conditions. In\nsome countries their powers go beyond this to include the right to engage in\nco-decision making, to initiate inspections and accident investigations and to\nreview management\u2019s reports to government. Most importantly, some workers\u2019\nhealth and safety representatives are empowered to order the shut-down of an\nimminently hazardous operation (also called \u201cred-tagging\u201d, for the marker\nplaced on the spot), as in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. They are in\ncertain instances, such as in France and some provinces of Canada, directly\ninvolved in the enforcement of health and safety regulations. Prior\nconsultation of the joint committee is sometimes necessary before an employer\ncan make any significant change in health, safety or working conditions (as in\nFrance and the Netherlands). In Belgium intercompany health services are under\nthe control of a joint committee. In Italy the committees\u2019 role includes the\npromotion of prevention, and in Greece they can, with the employers\u2019\nagreement, call for expert opinions on health and safety questions.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives necessarily enjoy protection from\ndiscrimination or retaliation in the exercise of their functions. They are\nentitled to at least some time off with pay, as well as to have the necessary\nmeans (the definition of which is often debated) to exercise their functions.\nIn addition, while in office some are specially shielded from economic layoffs\n(redundancies) or given extra protection from dismissal (as in Belgium).\nFrequently, worker health and safety representatives have a right to receive\nspecialized training (as in Denmark).\n\nThe effect that workers\u2019 health and safety representatives and joint\ncommittees can have will of course depend not only on rights and duties set\nout in legislation or in a collective bargaining agreement, but on how they\nare exercised in practice. This is in turn influenced by factors that affect\nworkers\u2019 participation generally. Such representatives and joint committees\nare no substitute for the effective government enforcement of health and\nsafety standards or for what may be achieved by means of collective\nbargaining. However, \u201cmost observers believe that (mandated joint health and\nsafety) committees provide a more efficient regulatory regime for safety and\nhealth than inspectorate or civil liability schemes\u201d (Kaufman and Kleiner\n1993). In any event, the trend is definitely towards greater workers\u2019\nparticipation in health and safety matters, at least in terms of collective\nagreements covering larger enterprises and legislation. Where they operate as\neffective institutions, joint health and safety committees can be a valuable\ntool for identifying problems and raising awareness of hazards, thus\npotentially reducing the incidence of injury, disease and death on the job.\nThe extent to which they are effective, however, depends on a large range of\nvariables in the particular labour relations system and in the strategic\napproach taken to health and safety at the workplace.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSchregle (1994) has commented:\n\nIn practice, none of these workers\u2019 participation schemes has produced the\nexpected results. There are many reasons for this. One is that, in a general\nway, trade unions and employers do not have the same view of participation.\nWhile it is the workers\u2019 desire to exert a tangible and concrete influence on\nemployers\u2019 decisions in the sense of power-sharing, employers insist on\nmanagement rights or management prerogatives, derived from private ownership,\nto run the business according to their own criteria and decision-making power,\naffording to workers at most the right to express their views and positions\nwithout binding effect on management. The result of all this is confusion over\nsuch terms as consultation, workers\u2019 participation, workers\u2019 participation in\nmanagement, co-determination, co-management, etc.\n\nThe fact remains that in most workplaces around the world, there is little\neffective employee participation at the enterprise level. The first level of\nparticipation and indeed a prerequisite for it, is the provision of\ninformation, followed by consultation. Within Europe, research has indicated a\nwide variation in the extent of implementation of the 1989 framework directive\non health and safety, when it comes to workers\u2019 participation; it may get a\nnew lease on life with the impetus of the 1995 directive on European works\ncouncils. A high degree of non-participation also characterizes other regions.\nNevertheless, high hopes continue to be held out for strengthening mechanisms\nfor workers\u2019 participation at the enterprise level.\n\nThe traditional approach to workers\u2019 participation as promotional of greater\nworker-management cooperation falls short of being satisfactory in relation to\nhealth and safety issues, where the categorization of labour relations as\nconflictual or cooperative does not particularly advance the debate. As Vogel\n(1994) notes:\n\n...the problem of worker participation is clearly not confined to the\ninstitutionalized forms of participation in or outside the undertaking. The\nbasis of participation lies in the recognition that distinct interests are in\nplay giving rise to specific rationales... The essential legitimacy of\nparticipation is to be found outside the firm in a democratic requirement\nwhich refuses to admit that the self-determination of individuals should be\nconfined within the rules of political representation and in a view of health\nconceived as a purposeful, social process through which individuals and\ncommunities develop strategies for self-fulfilment and defence.\n\nIn the end, the differing functions of various workers\u2019 participation schemes\nmake it difficult to assess their comparative impact. As collective bargaining\nshrinks in coverage, however, greater use of management-led workers\u2019\nparticipation arrangements may be expected.\n\n## CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nMarco Biagi\n\n### Worker Participation in Health and Safety Matters\n\nWorker participation in safety organization in plants can be planned in many\nways, depending on national law and practice. This article refers only to\nconsultation and information arrangements, not related forms of employee\ninvolvement. Additional coverage of specific aspects somewhat linked with\nconsultation and information (e.g., participation in or initiation of\ninspections, participation in training activities) is offered elsewhere in\nthis chapter.\n\nThe idea of employers and employees working jointly to improve health and\nsafety at work is based on several principles:\n\n1\\. Workers can contribute to prevention of industrial accidents by spotting\nand warning about potential hazards and giving notice of imminent dangers.\n\n2\\. Involving employees educates and motivates them to cooperate in the\npromotion of safety.\n\n3\\. Ideas and experiences of workers are regarded as a useful contribution to\nsafety improvement.\n\n4\\. People have a right to be involved in decisions that affect their working\nlife, particularly their health and well-being.\n\n5\\. Cooperation between the two sides of industry, essential to improve\nworking conditions, should be based on an equal partnership.\n\nThese principles have been laid down in the ILO Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155). Article 20 provides that \u201cco-operation between\nmanagement and workers and/or their representatives within the undertaking\nshall be an essential element of organizational and other measures\u201d in the\narea of occupational health and safety. Also the ILO Communications within the\nUndertaking Recommendation, 1967 (No. 129), Paragraph 2(1), underlines that:\n\n...employers and their organizations as well as workers and their\norganizations should, in their common interest, recognise the importance of a\nclimate of mutual understanding and confidence within undertakings that is\nfavourable both to the efficiency of the undertaking and to the aspirations of\nthe workers.\n\nThe underlying philosophy is that employers and employees have a common\ninterest in a self-regulating system in industrial accident prevention;\nactually they are more interested in occupational safety than in occupational\nhealth, since the occupational origin of accidents is more simple to establish\nand they are thus compensated more easily. Also for this reason safety\nrepresentatives in many countries were historically the first employee\nrepresentatives at the workplace to have their rights and duties determined by\nlaw or collective agreements. Today there is probably no subject in labour\nrelations and human resources management on which the social partners are so\nready to collaborate as in health and safety matters. But in some national\ncontexts trade unions have not put sufficient resources into the safety and\nhealth effort to make it a major issue in either negotiations or contract\nadministration.\n\n### Information and Consultation Rights in Legislation in ILO and European\nUnion.\n\nThe general obligation for employers to disclose information in health and\nsafety matters to workers and/or their representatives and seek their opinion\nvia consultative arrangements is provided by Article 20 of the ILO Prevention\nof Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174). This norm prescribes\nthat \u201cthe workers and their representatives at a major hazard installation\nshall be consulted through appropriate cooperative mechanisms in order to\nensure a safe system of work\u201d. More specifically workers and their\nrepresentatives have the right to:\n\n(a) be adequately and suitably informed of the hazards associated with the\nmajor hazard installation and their likely consequences; (b) be informed of\nany orders, instructions or recommendations made by the competent authority;\n(c) be consulted in the preparation of and have access to, the following\ndocuments: (i) safety reports, (ii) emergency plans and procedures, (iii)\naccident reports.\n\nAs a consequence of these information and consultation rights, workers are\nentitled \u201cto discuss with the employer any potential hazards they consider\ncapable of generating a major accident\u201d (Article 20(f)).\n\nMore generally ILO Convention No. 155 lays down rules concerning occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment, providing for effective\narrangements at the level of the undertaking (be they regulated by law or\ncollective bargaining or even left to local/domestic practices) under which\n\u201c(c) representatives of workers... are given adequate information on measures\ntaken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and may consult\ntheir representative organizations about such information provided they do not\ndisclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article 19). The same norm adds that under these\narrangements workers or their representatives must be \u201cenabled to enquire into\nand are consulted by the employer, on all aspects of occupational safety and\nhealth associated with their work\u201d. And for this purpose \u201ctechnical advisers\nmay, by mutual agreement, be brought in from outside the undertaking\u201d.\n\nILO Recommendation No. 164 supplementing Convention No. 155 (Paragraph 12)\nclarifies that information and consultation rights on safety and health\nmatters should be granted to a variety of participatory institutions: workers\u2019\nsafety delegates, workers\u2019 safety and health committees, joint safety and\nhealth committees and other workers\u2019 representatives. This text also states\nimportant principles affecting the nature and the content of\ninformation/consultation. These practices should first of all enable the\nabove-mentioned specialized forms of workers\u2019 representation \u201cto contribute in\nthe decision-making process at the level of the undertaking regarding matters\nof safety and health\u201d (Article 12(e)).\n\nThese are not simply rights to know and to be heard: workers and their\nrepresentatives should \u201c(a) be given adequate information on safety and health\nmatters, enabled to examine factors affecting safety and health and encouraged\nto propose measures on the subject\u201d. They should also \u201c(b) be consulted when\nmajor new safety and health measures are envisaged and before they are carried\nout and seek to obtain the support of the workers for such measures\u201d and\n\u201c(c)... in planning alterations to work processes, work content or\norganization of work, which may have safety or health implications for the\nworkers\u201d.\n\nThe principle under which \u201crepresentatives of the workers... should be\ninformed and consulted in advance by the employer on projects, measures and\ndecisions which are liable to have harmful consequences on the health of\nworkers\u201d (ILO Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration)\nRecommendation, 1977 (No. 156), Paragraph 21) reflects the idea of an\n\u201ceffective policy of communication\u201d stated in general terms by Paragraph 3 of\nILO Recommendation No. 129, which prescribes that \u201cinformation is given and\nthat consultation takes place between the parties concerned before decisions\non matters of major interest are taken by management\u201d. And in order to make\nthese practices effective, \u201csteps should be taken to train those concerned in\nthe use of communications methods\u201d (Para. 6).\n\nThe participative approach in labour relations in the area of health and\nsafety is confirmed by other international legal texts. A meaningful example\nin this respect is offered by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the\nintroduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of\npeople working in countries of the European Union. Article 10 provides for the\nemployer an obligation to take appropriate measures so that workers and/or\ntheir representatives receive, in accordance with national law and/or\npractices, all necessary information\u201d concerning safety and health risks,\nprotective and preventive measures (also for first aid, fire-fighting and\nevacuation of workers and in case of serious and imminent danger). This\ninformation has to be \u201cprovided in a suitable form to temporary workers and\nhired workers present in the establishment or enterprise\u201d. Additionally\n\u201cworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of\nworkers, or workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the\nsafety and health of workers\u201d must have access to risk assessment and\nprotective measures, reports on occupational accidents and illnesses suffered\nby workers and all information yielded by protective and preventive measures,\ninspection agencies and bodies responsible for safety and health.\n\nArticle 11 of the EC Directive links consultation and participation. In fact\nemployers are under the obligation to \u201cconsult workers and/or their\nrepresentatives and allow them to take part in discussions on all questions\nrelating to safety and health at work\u201d. That presupposes \u201cthe consultation of\nworkers, the right of workers and/or their representatives to make proposals\n(and) balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or\npractices\u201d. The document continues, prescribing that:\n\nworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of workers\nor workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the safety and\nhealth of workers shall participate in a balanced way, in accordance with\nnational laws and/or practices, or be consulted in advance and in due time by\nthe employer...\n\nThe objective of these rights is to cover all measures which may substantially\naffect health and safety, including the designation of employees required to\nimplement certain measures (first-aid, fire-fighting and evacuation of\nworkers) and the planning and organization of adequate health and safety\ntraining throughout the employment relationship (upon hiring, job transfer,\nintroduction of new working equipment, introduction of any new technology).\n\nThe choice is clear: no to conflict, yes to participation in health and safety\nlabour relations. This is the meaning of the EC Framework Directive, which\ngoes beyond the simple logic of the right to information. The system is based\non a genuine form of consultation, since it must take place \u201cin advance and in\ngood time\u201d \u2013 in other words, not only prior to decisions being adopted by the\nemployer but also soon enough for proposals and comments to be made about\nthem.\n\nThe Directive also uses the ambiguous expression \u201cbalanced participation\u201d, a\nformula open to various interpretations. The notion is broader than (or, at\nleast, different from) that of consultation, but not to the extent of\nconstituting a form of joint decision making, which would prevent employers\nfrom taking measures which had not been approved by the workers or their\nrepresentatives. It seems quite clearly to be a form of participation going\nbeyond mere consultation (otherwise the article heading \u201cconsultation and\nparticipation\u201d would be nonsense) but not necessarily as far as joint decision\nmaking. The concept is left somewhat vague: it embraces a range of multiple\nforms of worker participation which vary considerably between Member States of\nthe European Union. And in any case the Directive does not place any\nobligation to provide a specific form of balanced participation.\n\nIn both the ILO and EC texts, information seems to be a concept whereby\nmanagement informs the employees\u2019 representatives body in writing or in a\nmeeting. Consultation means that normally joint committees are set up in which\nemployees\u2019 representatives are not merely informed by management, but can also\ncomment and expect justification from management in the event of differing\nopinions. Certainly these concepts differ from negotiation (when a\ncontractually binding outcome is worked out in joint negotiating committees at\ncompany or inter-company level) and co-determination (where the employee has a\nright of veto and decisions require the agreement of both parties).\n\nFor Community-scale undertakings and groups thereof, EU Council Directive No.\n94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 requires setting up European Works Council or an\ninformation and consultation procedure. The information relates \u201cin particular\nto transnational questions which significantly affect workers\u2019 interests\u201d\n(Article 6(3)). Time will tell if this is used for safety and health purposes.\n\n### Role of Workers\u2019 Representatives in Risk Assessment and Improvement of\nWork Environment: Record-keeping\n\nThe active nature of consultation is also stressed in Article 11(3) of the EC\nFramework Directive, which states that either workers with specific functions\nin this area or workers\u2019 representatives in general \u201cmay call on the employer\nto take appropriate measures and submit to him relevant proposals by means of\nwhich all risks to workers may be reduced and/or sources of danger\neliminated\u201d.\n\nThe Framework Directive, with its provisions on risk management, while placing\nclear responsibilities on employers, also favours the greater involvement of\nworkers and their representatives in consultations on management strategies in\nhealth and safety. Employers must assess risks and present their risk-control\nmanagement systems in a plan or statement. In all cases they are expected to\nconsult with and involve workers and/or their representatives in all the\ndesign, implementation and monitoring of these systems. But it is undeniable\nthat this Directive, by conferring relevant participative rights to workers,\nhas at the same time adopted an approach of \u201cself-assessment\u201d. Other EC\nDirectives require, among other things, the recording of the results of\nmeasurements and examinations and lay down the employees\u2019 rights of access to\nthese records.\n\nAlso ILO Recommendation No. 164 (Para. 15(2)) provides that:\n\n...employers should be required to keep such records relevant to occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment as are considered necessary by\nthe competent authority or authorities; these might include records of all\nnotifiable occupational accidents and injuries to health which arise in the\ncourse of or in connection with work, records of authorisation and exemptions\nunder laws or regulations in the field and any conditions to which they may be\nsubject, certificates relating to supervision of the health of workers in the\nundertaking and data concerning exposure to specified substances and agents.\n\nIt is a general principle worldwide that employers are required to keep\nrecords, for instance of accidents and occupational diseases, or on the use or\npresence of biological and environmental monitoring.\n\n### National Laws and Practices\n\nBy comparison, labour relations systems exist (e.g., Italy) where statutory\nlaw provides no specific right to information and consultation in occupational\nsafety and health for workers\u2019 representatives, although such a right is often\nincluded in collective agreements. Italian legislation gives the workers\nthemselves the right to control the implementation of standards relating to\nthe prevention of accidents and occupational diseases, as well as the right to\ndevelop studies and adopt adequate measures in order to safeguard health and\nsafety at work. In other systems (e.g., in the United Kingdom) in order to\nobtain disclosure of information on matters of health and safety as provided\nby law, it is necessary first to have safety representatives appointed; but\nthis is possible only if there is a recognized trade union in existence at the\nundertaking. In situations where the employer refuses or withdraws the\nnecessary status of a recognized trade union, information and consultation\nrights cannot be exercised.\n\nThese national experiences raise the question: To what extent is effective\nworkers\u2019 participation in health and safety conditional on the adoption of\nstatutory arrangements? Certainly some legal backing seems to be helpful, the\noptimum amount of legislation being probably at a point where it provides for\nthe election of workers\u2019 representatives with sufficiently strong rights to\nallow them to function independently of management, while at the same time\nleaving room for a certain variety in the organizational arrangements for\nparticipation in different sectors and corporations.\n\nIn general labour relations systems provide by law that workers\u2019\nrepresentatives are to be informed and consulted in health and safety matters.\nWhen joint committees composed of management and employee representatives are\nestablished, they enjoy considerable powers. For instance in France the\ncommittee for health, safety and working conditions may propose preventive\nmeasures: an employer declining to accept them must give detailed reasons. But\nempirical evidence demonstrates that sometimes safety representatives seem\nmore efficient than joint committees since they are less dependent on the\nexistence of a cooperative relationship.\n\nThrough various forms of representational participation, employees in general\nenjoy rights recognized by ILO Conventions and Recommendations (plus EC\ndirectives, when applicable) mentioned earlier with special reference to\nindustrialized free-market economies. Safety representatives and/or works\ncouncillors have a right to be informed and consulted by the employer on all\nissues relating to the company\u2019s operations and the improvement of working\nconditions, including health and safety matters. They have the right to see\nall relevant documents that the employer is statutorily obliged to keep and\nalso to see any statements on the subject and the results of any research.\nThey may also have copies of any of these documents if required.\n\n### Effectiveness of Information and Consultation Rights\n\nApart from specific aspects (such as use of experts, participation in or\ninitiation of inspections, protection from victimization) which strongly\naffect the effectiveness of information and consultation rights in health and\nsafety, there are general factors which have to be taken into account in this\nrespect. First, the size of the undertaking: the effectiveness of controls is\non the wane in small units, where trade unions and other forms of workers\u2019\nrepresentation are almost absent. Small-sized establishments are also least\nlikely to implement statutory requirements.\n\nSecondly, where safety representatives are integrated into the formal trade\nunion organization at the workplace, they are more likely to achieve the\nexpected improvements in the working environment. Thirdly, consultation and\ninformation arrangements in health and safety reflect the more conflictual\n(e.g., UK, Italy) or cooperative (e.g., Germany, Scandinavian countries,\nJapan) nature of the surrounding labour relations system. And in general,\ncollaboration between management and labour favours the disclosing of\ninformation and consultation.\n\nFourthly, the role of managerial initiative should not be underestimated. More\nthan the existence of statutory rights, consultation and information are\neffective when there is the presence of a managerial culture which supports\nthem. Employers\u2014by their attitude towards training, their commitment to\ndisclosing information and their speed in answering queries\u2014are able to create\nan adversarial or cooperative climate. Legal backing is essential to guarantee\nfull independence to worker representatives to act in this field, but then the\nsuccess of information/consultation arrangements depends largely on the\nvoluntary choice of both sides of industry.\n\nLastly it must be said that a precondition for successful worker\nrepresentation in health and safety at the workplace is public awareness. It\nis fundamental for this specialized form of employee involvement that such a\nneed is perceived and valued by people at work. There is empirical evidence\nthat workers identify health and safety as one of the most significant\nconcerns in their working life.\n\n### Safeguards on Use of Information\n\nComparative experience demonstrates that in general safety representatives are\nconsidered to be in breach of confidence if they reveal any information\nrelating to an employer\u2019s production processes and other professional secrets.\nFurthermore, they are obliged to use discretion with regard to any information\nprovided to them which the employer indicates is confidential. ILO Convention\nNo. 155 recognizes this by providing that enterprise-level representatives may\nconsult their representative organizations about occupational health and\nsafety information \u201cprovided they do not disclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article\n19(c)).\n\nIn some systems (e.g., Greece) employee representatives on works councils are\nobliged not to communicate to third parties information acquired which is of\nfundamental importance to the enterprise and which, if disclosed, would harm\nthe enterprise\u2019s competitiveness. The employee representatives and the\nemployer are supposed to decide jointly what information can be disclosed.\nUnder other systems (e.g., Luxembourg), where if employee representatives\ndisagree with an employer\u2019s classification of information as confidential,\nthey may refer the matter to the inspectorate for a decision.\n\nIn some countries the duty of confidentiality is only implicit (e.g., Italy).\nAlso when there is no specific requirement in this respect (e.g., United\nKingdom), employee representatives cannot receive from the employer\ninformation relating to the health of individuals (unless their consent is\ngiven), information that would damage national security or information that\nwould damage the employer\u2019s undertaking. Finally (e.g., Sweden) the duty to\nobserve confidentiality may not prevent safety representatives from passing on\nthe information received to the executive board of their trade union, which\nwill also be bound to observe confidentiality.\n\n## LABOUR RELATIONS ASPECTS OF TRAINING\nIn contemporary industrial relations systems, the functions fulfilled by trade\nunions are, like employers\u2019 organizations, basically the following: defence\nand promotion of the members\u2019 interests; political representation; and\nprovision of services to members. The flip side of trade unions\u2019\nrepresentative function is their control function: their legitimacy depends in\npart upon the ability to exert discipline over the membership, as for example\nin calling or ending a strike. The trade unions\u2019 constant challenge is to\nincrease their density, that is, the number of members as a percentage of the\nformal sector workforce. The members of trade unions are individuals; their\ndues, called contributions in some systems, support the union\u2019s activities.\n(Trade unions financed by employers, called \u201ccompany unions\u201d, or by\ngovernments as in formerly Communist countries, are not considered here, since\nonly independent organizations of workers are true trade unions.) Affiliation\nis generally a matter of an individual\u2019s voluntary decision, although some\nunions that have been able to win closed shop or union security arrangements\nare considered to be the representatives of all workers covered by a\nparticular collective bargaining agreement (i.e., in countries where trade\nunions are recognized as representatives of workers in a circumscribed\nbargaining unit). Trade unions may be affiliated to umbrella organizations at\nthe industrial, national, regional and international levels.\nThe international labour movement on a global, as opposed to a regional or\nnational level, consists of international associations of national federations\nof labour unions. There are currently three such internationals, reflecting\ndifferent ideological tendencies: the International Confederation of Free\nTrade Unions (ICFTU), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the\nrelatively small, originally Christian, World Congress of Labour (WCL). The\nICFTU is the largest, with 174 affiliated unions from 124 countries in 1995,\nrepresenting 116 million trade union members. These groups lobby\nintergovernmental organizations on overall economic and social policy and\npress for worldwide protection of basic trade union rights. They can be\nthought of as the political force behind the international labour movement.\nThe industrial force of the international labour movement lies in the\ninternational associations of specific labour unions, usually drawn from one\ntrade, industry or economic sector. Known as International Trade Secretariats\n(ITSs) or Trade Union Internationals (TUIs), they may be independent,\naffiliated to, or controlled by the internationals. Coverage has traditionally\nbeen by sector, but also in some cases is by employee category (such as white-\ncollar workers), or by employer (public or private). For example, in 1995\nthere were 13 operative ITSs aligned with the ICFTU, distributed as follows:\nbuilding and woodworking; chemical and mining, energy; commercial, clerical,\nprofessional and technical; education; entertainment; food, agriculture,\nrestaurant and catering; graphic arts; journalism; metalworking; postal and\ntelecommunications; public service; textile, garment and leather work;\ntransport. The ITSs concentrate mainly on industry-specific issues, such as\nindustrial disputes and pay rates, but also the application of health and\nsafety provisions in a specific sector. They provide information, education,\ntraining and other services to affiliated unions. They also help coordinate\ninternational solidarity between unions in different countries, and represent\nthe interests of workers in various international and regional forums.\nSuch action is illustrated by the international trade union response to the\nincident at Bhopal, India, involving the leak of methyl isocyanate, which\nclaimed thousands of victims on 3 December 1984. At the request of their\nIndian national trade union affiliates, the ICFTU and the International\nFederation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers\u2019 Unions (ICEM) sent a\nmission to Bhopal to study the causes and effects of the gas leak. The report\ncontained recommendations for preventing similar disasters and endorsed a list\nof safety principles; this report has been used by trade unionists in both\nindustrialized and developing countries as a basis of programmes for improving\nhealth and safety at work.\nSource: Rice 1995.\nTrade unions are structured along various lines: by craft or occupation, by\nbranch of industry, by whether they group white- or blue-collar workers and\nsometimes even by enterprise. There are also general unions, which include\nworkers from various occupations and industries. Even in countries where\nmergers of industrial unions and general unions are the trend, the situation\nof agricultural or rural workers has often favoured the development of special\nstructures for that sector. On top of this breakdown there is often a\nterritorial division, with regional and sometimes local subunits, within a\nunion. In some countries there have been splits in the labour movement around\nideological (party politics) and even religious lines which then come to be\nreflected in trade union structure and membership. Public sector employees\ntend to be represented by unions separate from those representing employees in\nthe private sector, although there are exceptions to this as well.\nThe legal status of a trade union may be that of any other association, or it\nmay be subject to special rules. A great number of countries require trade\nunions to register and to divulge certain basic information to the authorities\n(name, address, identity of officials, etc.). In some countries this goes\nbeyond mere record-keeping to interference; in extreme cases of disregard for\nfreedom of association principles, trade unions will need government\nauthorization to operate. As representatives of workers, trade unions are\nempowered to enter into engagements on their behalf. Some countries (such as\nthe United States) require employer recognition of trade unions as an initial\nprerequisite to engaging in collective bargaining.\nTrade union density varies widely between and within countries. In some\ncountries in Western Europe, for instance, it is very high in the public\nsector but tends to be low in the private sector and especially in its white-\ncollar employment. The figures for blue-collar employment in that region are\nmixed, from a high in Austria and Sweden to a low in France, where, however,\ntrade union political power far exceeds what membership figures would suggest.\nThere is some positive correlation between centralization of bargaining and\ntrade union density, but exceptions to this also exist.\nAs voluntary associations, trade unions draw up their own rules, usually in\nthe form of a constitution and by-laws. In democratic trade union structures,\nmembers select trade union officers either by direct vote or through delegates\nto a general conference. Internal union government in a small, highly\ndecentralized union of workers in a particular occupational group is likely to\ndiffer significantly from that found in a large, centralized general or\nindustrial union. There are tasks to allocate among union officers, between\npaid and unpaid union representatives and coordination work to be done. The\nfinancial resources available to a union will also vary depending upon its\nsize and the ease with which it can collect dues. Institution of a dues check-\noff system (whereby dues are deducted from a worker\u2019s wages and paid directly\nto the union) alleviates this task greatly. In most of Central and Eastern\nEurope, trade unions that were dominated and funded by the state are being\ntransformed and/or joined by new independent organizations; all are struggling\nto find a place and operate successfully in the new economic structure.\nExtremely low wages (and thus dues) there and in developing countries with\ngovernment-supported unions make it difficult to build a strong independent\nunion movement.\nIn addition to the important function of collective bargaining, one of the\nmain activities of trade unions in many countries is their political work.\nThis may take the form of direct representation, with trade unions being given\nreserved seats in some parliaments (e.g., Senegal) and on tripartite bodies\nthat have a role in determining national economic and social policy (e.g.,\nAustria, France, the Netherlands), or on tripartite advisory bodies in the\nfields of labour and social affairs (e.g., in many Latin American and some\nAfrican and Asian countries). In the European Union, trade union federations\nhave had an important impact on the development of social policy. More\ntypically, trade unions have an influence through the exercise of power\n(backed up by a threat of industrial action) and lobbying political decision\nmakers at the national level. It is certainly true that trade unions have\nsuccessfully fought for greater legislative protection for all workers around\nthe world; some believe that this has been a bittersweet victory, in the long\nrun undermining their own justification to exist. The objectives and issues of\nunion political action have often extended well beyond narrower interests; a\nprime example of this was the struggle against apartheid within South Africa\nand the international solidarity expressed by unions around the world in words\nand in deeds (e.g., organizing dockworker boycotts of imported South African\ncoal). Whether trade union political activity is on the offence or the defence\nwill of course depend largely on whether the government in power tends to be\npro- or anti-labour. It will also depend upon the union\u2019s relationship to\npolitical parties; some unions, particularly in Africa, were part of their\ncountries\u2019 struggles for independence and maintain very close ties with ruling\npolitical parties. In other countries there is a traditional interdependence\nbetween the labour movement and a political party (e.g., Australia, United\nKingdom), whereas in others alliances may shift over time. In any event, the\npower of trade unions often exceeds what would be expected from their\nnumerical strength, particularly where they represent workers in a key\neconomic or public service sector, such as transport or mining.\nAside from trade unions, many other types of workers\u2019 participation have\nsprung up to provide indirect or direct representation of employees. In some\ninstances they exist alongside trade unions; in others they are the only type\nof participation available to workers. The functions and powers of workers\u2019\nrepresentatives that exist under such arrangements are described in the\narticle \u201cForms of workers\u2019 participation\u2019\u2019.\nThe third type of function of trade unions, providing services to members,\nfocuses first and foremost on the workplace. A shop steward at the enterprise\nlevel is there to ensure that workers\u2019 rights under the collective bargaining\nagreement and the law are being respected\u2013and, if not, to take action. The\nunion officer\u2019s job is to defend the interests of workers vis-\u00e0-vis\nmanagement, thereby legitimizing his or her own representative role. This may\ninvolve taking up an individual grievance over discipline or dismissal, or\ncooperating with management on a joint health and safety committee. Outside\nthe workplace, many unions provide other types of benefit, such as\npreferential access to credit and participation in welfare schemes. The union\nhall can also serve as a centre for cultural events or even large family\nceremonies. The range of services a union can offer to its members is vast and\nreflects the creativity and resources of the union itself as well as the\ncultural milieu in which it operates.\nAs Visser observes:\nThe power of trade unions depends on various internal and external factors. We\ncan distinguish between organizational power (how many internal sources of\npower can unions mobilize?), institutional power (which external sources of\nsupport can unions depend on?) and economic power (which market forces play\ninto the hands of unions?) (Visser in van Ruysseveldt et al. 1995).\nAmong the factors he identifies for a strong trade union structure are the\nmobilization of a large, stable, dues-paying and well-trained membership (to\nthis could be added a membership that reflects the composition of the labour\nmarket), avoidance of organizational fragmentation and political or\nideological rifts and development of an organizational structure that provides\na presence at the company level while having central control of funds and\ndecision making. Whether such a model for success, which to date has been\nnational in character, can evolve in the face of an increasingly\ninternationalized economy, is the great challenge facing trade unions at this\njuncture.\nBreen Creighton\nJoint consultation and participation can be effective only in an environment\nwhere there is adequate recognition of and respect for the right of employers\nand workers to associate freely and for their organizations to be able to\nrepresent their interests effectively. In a very real sense, therefore,\nrespect for the right to organize can be seen to be an essential precondition\nof an effective occupational safety and health strategy at both the national\nand international level and at the workplace. That being the case, it is\nnecessary and appropriate to look more closely at ILO standards relating to\nfreedom of association, bearing in mind their application in the context of\nthe prevention of work-related injury and disease and the compensation and\nrehabilitation of those who have incurred such injury or disease. Freedom of\nassociation standards require that there be proper recognition in law and\npractice of the right of workers and employers to form and to join the\norganizations of their choice and of the right of those organizations, once\nestablished, to formulate and to implement freely their programmes.\nRights of association and representation also underpin tripartite\n(governments, employers and workers) cooperation in the field of occupational\nhealth and safety. Such cooperation is promoted in the context of ILO\nstandard-setting, for example, by:\n\u00b7 enjoining governments to consult with representative organizations of\nemployers and workers in relation to the formulation and implementation of\npolicy on occupational health and safety at the national or regional level\n(e.g., Asbestos Convention, 1986 (No. 162), Article 4 and Occupational Safety\nand Health Convention, 1981 (No. 155), Articles 1 and 8)\n\u00b7 encouraging joint consultation and cooperation on occupational safety and\nhealth matters at the level of the workplace (e.g., Prevention of Major\nIndustrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174), Article 9(f) and (g))\n\u00b7 requiring the joint participation of employers and workers in the\nformulation and implementation of occupational safety and health policy in the\nworkplace (see especially Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No.\n155), Articles 19 and 20 and Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation,\n1981 (No. 164), para 12).\nThe \u201cright of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as\nby the employers\u201d was one of the methods and principles set out in Article 41\nof the original Constitution of the ILO. This principle now finds express\nrecognition in the Preamble to the Constitution as one of the essential\npreconditions of the establishment of social justice, which is itself seen as\nthe essential precondition of universal and lasting peace. Together with the\nprinciple of tripartism, it is also accorded express recognition in Article I\nof the Declaration of Philadelphia, which was appended to the Constitution in\n1946. This Constitutional endorsement of the importance of respect for the\nprinciples of freedom of association helps provide one of the juridical bases\nfor the capacity of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of\nAssociation and the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association to\ninquire into alleged breaches of the principles of freedom of association.\nAs early as 1921 the International Labour Conference adopted the Right of\nAssociation (Agriculture) Convention (No. 11), which requires ratifying States\nto \u201csecure to all those engaged in agriculture the same rights of association\nand combination as to industrial workers\u201d. It does not, however, say anything\nabout the rights which are to be accorded to the industrial workers with whom\nthose engaged in agriculture are to enjoy parity! Attempts to adopt a more\ngeneral instrument dealing with freedom of association in the 1920s foundered\nupon the rocks of employer and government insistence that the right to form\nand join trade unions must be accompanied by a correlative right not to join.\nThe matter was re-opened in the period immediately after the Second World War.\nThis duly resulted in the adoption of the Right of Association (Non-\nMetropolitan Territories) Convention, 1947 (No. 84), the Freedom of\nAssociation and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)\nand the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98).\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are among the most important and the most widely\nratified of all ILO Conventions: as of 31 December 1996, Convention No. 87 had\nattracted 119 ratifications, while No. 98 had attracted 133. Between them they\nembody what can properly be regarded as the four key elements in the notion of\nfreedom of association. They are regarded as the benchmark for the\ninternational protection of freedom of association for trade union purposes,\nas reflected, for example, in Article 8 of the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and Article 22 of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Within the ILO structure, they form\nthe basis for the principles of freedom of association as developed and\napplied by the Governing Body\u2019s Committee on Freedom of Association and the\nFact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, even\nthough in technical terms those bodies derive their jurisdiction from the\nConstitution of the Organization rather than the Conventions. They also\nconstitute a major focus for the deliberations of the Committee of Experts on\nthe Application of Conventions and Recommendations and of the Conference\nCommittee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\nDespite the pivotal role of Conventions Nos. 87 and 98, it should be\nappreciated that they are by no means the only formal standard-setting\ninstruments which have been adopted under the auspices of the ILO in the field\nof freedom of association. On the contrary, since 1970 the Conference has\nadopted further four Conventions and four Recommendations dealing in greater\ndetail with various aspects of the principles of freedom of association, or\nwith their application in certain specific contexts:\n\u00b7 the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135) and Recommendation (No.\n143), 1971\n\u00b7 the Rural Workers\u2019 Organizations Convention (No. 141) and Recommendation\n(No. 149), 1975\n\u00b7 the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention (No. 151) and\nRecommendation (No. 158), 1978\n\u00b7 the Collective Bargaining Convention (No. 154) and Recommendation (No. 163),\n1981\nThe core elements of the principles of freedom of association as embodied in\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 are:\n\u00b7 that \u201cworkers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the\nright to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization\nconcerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without previous\nauthorization\u201d (Article 2 of Convention No. 87)\n\u00b7 that organizations of employers and workers, once established, should have\nthe right \u201cto draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their\nrepresentatives in full freedom, to organize their administration and\nactivities and to formulate their programmes\u201d (Article 3(1) of Convention No.\n87). Furthermore, the public authorities must \u201crefrain from any interference\nwhich would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof\u201d\n(Article 3(2))\n\u00b7 that workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of anti-union\ndiscrimination in respect of their employment\u201d (Article 1(1) of Convention No.\n98)\n\u00b7 that \u201cmeasures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where\nnecessary, to encourage and to promote the full development and utilization of\nmachinery for voluntary negotiation between employers and employers\u2019\norganizations and workers\u2019 organizations, with a view to the regulation of\nterms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements\u201d (Article\n4 of Convention No. 98)\nAll of the guarantees provided by Convention No. 87 are subject to the proviso\nset out in Article 8(1): \u201cin exercising the rights provided for in this\nConvention workers and employers and their respective organizations... shall\nrespect the law of the land\u201d. This in turn is subject to the further proviso\nthat the \u201claw of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be\napplied so as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.\u201d\nIt should also be noted that by virtue of Article 9(1) of Convention No. 87 it\nis permissible, but not necessary, to qualify the application of the\nguarantees set out in that Convention to members of the police and of the\narmed forces. Article 5(1) of Convention No. 98 is to the same effect, while\nArticle 6 of that instrument stipulates that the Convention \u201cdoes not deal\nwith the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the\nState, nor shall it be construed as prejudicing their rights or status in any\nway.\u201d\nThe right of workers and employers to form and to join the organizations of\ntheir choice is the pivot of all of the other guarantees provided by\nConventions Nos. 87 and 98 and by the principles of freedom of association. It\nis subject only to the qualification set out in Article 9(1) of the\nConvention. This means that it is not permissible to deny any group of workers\nother than members of the police or the armed forces the right to form or join\nthe trade unions of their choice. It follows that denial or restriction of the\nright of public servants, agricultural workers, school teachers and so on to\nform or join the organizations of their choice would not be consistent with\nthe requirements of Article 2.\nIt is, however, permissible for the rules of a trade union or an employer\norganization to restrict the categories of workers or employers who may join\nthe organization. The point is that any such restriction must be the result of\nthe free choice of the members of the organization \u2013 it must not be imposed\nfrom outside.\nThe right to associate set out in Article 2 is not accompanied by any\ncorrelative right not to associate. It will be recalled that earlier attempts\nto adopt a general freedom of association convention failed because of the\ninsistence by employer and some government delegates that the positive right\nto associate must carry with it a negative right not to associate. This issue\nwas again raised in the context of the debates on Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.\nHowever on this occasion a compromise was effected whereby the Conference\nadopted a resolution to the effect that the extent to which trade union\nsecurity devices (such as the \u201cclosed\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d shop and check-off\narrangements for trade union dues) were permissible or otherwise was a matter\nto be determined by national law and practice. In other words, the Conventions\nare considered neither to condone nor to condemn the closed shop and other\nforms of union security device, although such measures are not regarded as\nacceptable if they are imposed by law rather than adopted by agreement of the\nparties (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a).\nPerhaps the most difficult issue which has arisen in the context of Article 2\nrelates to the extent to which it can be said to endorse the notion of trade\nunion pluralism. In other words, is it consistent with Article 2 for the law\nto limit, directly or indirectly, the right of workers (or employers) to form\nor join the organization of their choice through the application of\nadministrative or legislative criteria?\nThere are two sets of competing interests in this context. On the one hand,\nArticle 2 is clearly meant to protect the right of workers and employers to\nchoose the organization to which they wish to belong and to choose not to\nbelong to organizations with which they are out of sympathy on political,\ndenominational or other grounds. On the other hand, governments (and indeed\ntrade unions) may argue that the excessive proliferation of trade unions and\nemployer organizations which may be an incident of unrestricted freedom of\nchoice is not conducive to the development of free and effective organizations\nor the establishment and maintenance of orderly industrial relations\nprocesses. This was an issue of particular difficulty in the Cold War era,\nwhen governments often sought to restrict the range of unions to which workers\ncould belong on ideological grounds. It remains a highly sensitive issue in\nmany developing countries where governments, for good reason or ill, wish to\nprevent what they see as the excessive proliferation of trade unions by\nplacing restrictions on the number and/or size of unions which can operate in\na given workplace or sector of the economy. The ILO\u2019s supervisory bodies have\ntended to adopt a fairly restrictive approach to this issue, permitting trade\nunion monopolies where they are the result of the free choice of the workers\nin the country concerned and permitting the adoption of \u201creasonable\u201d\nregistration criteria, but taking exception to legally imposed monopolies and\n\u201cunreasonable\u201d registration criteria. In doing so, they have attracted\nconsiderable criticism, especially from governments in developing countries\nwhich accuse them of adopting a Eurocentric approach to the application of the\nConvention \u2013 the point being that the characteristically European concern with\nthe rights of the individual is said to be inconsistent with the collectivist\ntraditions of many non-European cultures.\nIf Article 2 of Convention No. 87 protects the fundamental right of employers\nand workers to form and to join the organization of their choice, then Article\n3 can be seen to provide its logical corollary by protecting the\norganizational autonomy of organizations once established.\nAs the wording of Article 3(1) clearly indicates, this would include the\ndrafting, adoption and implementation of the constitutions and rules of\norganizations and the conduct of elections. However, the supervisory bodies\nhave accepted that it is permissible for the public authorities to impose\nminimum conditions upon the content or administration of rules for the purpose\nof \u201censuring a sound administration and preventing legal complications arising\nas a result of constitutions and rules being drawn up in insufficient detail\u201d\n(ILO 1994b). However, if such conditions are excessively detailed or onerous\nin application then they are likely to be adjudged to be inconsistent with the\nrequirements of Article 3.\nOver the years the supervisory bodies have consistently taken the view that\n\u201cthe right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right to organize\nprotected by Convention No. 87\u201d (ILO 1994b):\nThe Committee (of Experts) considers that the right to strike is one of the\nessential means available to workers and their organizations for the\nprotection of their economic and social interests. These interests not only\nhave to do with obtaining better working conditions and pursuing collective\ndemands of an occupational nature, but also with seeking solutions to economic\nand social policy questions and to labour problems of any kind which are of\ndirect concern to the workers.\nThis is one of the most controversial aspects of the entire jurisprudence\nrelating to freedom of association and in recent years in particular it has\ncome in for vigorous criticism from employer and government members of the\nConference Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.\n(See, for example, International Labour Conference, 80th Session (1993),\nRecord of Proceedings, 25/10-12 and 25/58-64 and International Labour\nConference, 81st Session (1994), Record of Proceedings, 25/92-94 and\n25/179-180.) It is, however, a firmly entrenched feature of the jurisprudence\non freedom of association. It finds clear recognition in Article 8(1) (d) of\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and was\nendorsed by the Committee of Experts in its 1994 General Survey on Freedom of\nAssociation and Collective Bargaining (ILO 1994b).\nIt is important to appreciate, however, that the right to strike as recognized\nby the supervisory bodies is not an unqualified one. In the first place, it\ndoes not extend to those groups of workers in relation to whom it is\npermissible to attenuate the guarantees set out in Convention No. 87, namely\nmembers of the police and armed forces. Furthermore, it has also been\ndetermined that the right to strike may legitimately be denied to \u201cpublic\nservants acting as agents of the public authority\u201d and to workers engaged in\nessential services in the sense of \u201cservices whose interruption would endanger\nthe life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.\u201d\nHowever, any restrictions upon the right to strike of workers in these latter\ncategories must be offset by compensatory guarantees, such as \u201cconciliation\nand mediation procedures leading, in the event of a deadlock, to arbitration\nmachinery seen to be reliable by the parties concerned. It is essential that\nthe latter be able to participate in determining and implementing the\nprocedure, which should furthermore provide sufficient guarantees of\nimpartiality and rapidity: arbitration awards should be binding on both\nparties and once issued should be implemented rapidly and completely\u201d (ILO\n1994b).\nIt is also permissible to impose temporary restrictions upon the right to\nstrike in times of \u201cacute national emergency\u201d. More generally, it is\npermissible to impose preconditions such as balloting requirements, exhaustion\nof conciliation procedures and so on, upon the exercise of the right to\nstrike. However, all such restrictions must \u201cbe reasonable and... not such as\nto place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union\norganizations\u201d.\nThe right to strike is often described as the weapon of last resort in\ncollective bargaining. If Article 3 is interpreted so as to protect the weapon\nof last resort, it seems reasonable to suppose that it must also protect the\nprocess of collective bargaining itself. The supervisory bodies have indeed\ntaken this view on a number of occasions, but in general they have preferred\nto base their jurisprudence on collective bargaining upon Article 4 of\nConvention No. 98. (For more detailed discussion of the ILO jurisprudence on\nthe right to strike, see Hodges-Aeberhard and Odero de Dios 1987; Ben-Israel\n1988).\nThe autonomy of organizations of employers and workers is also addressed in\nArticles 4 to 7 of Convention No. 87 and in Article 2 of Convention No. 98.\nArticle 4 provides that such organizations must not be \u201cliable to be dissolved\nor suspended by administrative authority\u201d. This does not mean that trade\nunions or employers\u2019 organizations cannot be deregistered or dissolved where\nthey have, for example, engaged in gross industrial misconduct or have not\nbeen run in accordance with their rules. But it does mean that any such\nsanction must be imposed through a duly constituted court or other appropriate\nbody, rather than by administrative diktat.\nArticle 5 protects the rights of organizations to form and join federations\nand confederations and also the right of organizations, federations and\nconfederations to affiliate with international organizations of employers and\nworkers. Furthermore, according to Article 6, the guarantees set out in\nArticles 2, 3 and 4 apply to federations and confederations in the same way as\nto first level organizations, while Article 7 stipulates that the acquisition\nof legal personality by organizations of employers or workers must not be made\nsubject to \u201cconditions of such a character as to restrict the application of\nthe provisions of Articles 2, 3 and 4.\u201d\nFinally, Article 2(1) of Convention No. 98 requires that organizations of\nemployers and workers are to enjoy \u201cadequate protection against acts of\ninterference by each other or each other\u2019s agents or members in their\nestablishment, functioning or administration\u201d. In practical terms, it seems\nsomewhat unlikely that trade unions would or could effectively interfere with\nthe internal functioning of employer organizations. It is quite conceivable,\nhowever, that in certain circumstances employers or their organizations would\nseek to interfere with the internal affairs of workers\u2019 organizations \u2013 for\nexample, by providing some or all of their funds. This possibility finds\nexpress recognition in Article 2(2):\nIn particular, acts which are designed to promote the establishment of\nworkers\u2019 organizations under the domination of employers or employers\u2019\norganizations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such\norganizations under the control of employers or employers\u2019 organizations,\nshall be deemed to constitute acts of interference within the meaning of this\nArticle.\nFor the guarantees set out in Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 to be meaningful in\npractice, it is clearly necessary that individuals who exercise their right to\nform or join organizations of workers be protected against victimization on\naccount of having done so. This logic finds recognition in Article 1(1) of\nConvention No. 98, which, as indicated, requires that \u201cworkers shall enjoy\nadequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of\ntheir employment.\u201d Article 1(2) takes the matter further:\nSuch protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated\nto:\n(a) make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not\njoin a union or shall relinquish trade union membership;\n(b) cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union\nmembership or because of participation in union activities outside working\nhours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours.\nAnti-union discrimination for these purposes would include refusal to employ,\ndismissal and other measures such as \u201ctransfer, relocation, demotion,\ndeprivation or restrictions of all kinds (remuneration, social benefits,\nvocational training)\u201d which may cause serious prejudice to the worker\nconcerned (see also Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158),\nArticle 5(a), (b) and (c), as well as ILO 1994b, para.212).\nNot only must there be comprehensive protection against anti-union\ndiscrimination as defined, but by virtue of Article 3 of Convention No. 98,\nthere must also be effective means of enforcing those protections:\nLegal standards are inadequate if they are not coupled with effective and\nexpeditious procedures and with sufficiently dissuasive penal sanctions to\nensure their application ... The onus placed on the employer to prove the\nalleged anti-union discriminatory measures are connected with questions other\nthan trade union matters, or presumptions established in the worker\u2019s favour\nare additional means of ensuring effective protection of the right to organize\nguaranteed by the Convention. Legislation which allows the employer in\npractice to terminate the employment of a worker on condition that he pay the\ncompensation provided for by law in any case of unjustified dismissal... is\ninadequate under the terms of Article 1 of the Convention. Legislation should\nalso provide effective means for implementing means of compensation, with the\nreinstatement of the dismissed worker, including retroactive compensation,\nbeing the most appropriate remedy in such cases of anti-union discrimination\n(ILO 1994b).\nThe guarantee set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 has been interpreted\nso as to protect both the right to engage in collective bargaining and the\nautonomy of the bargaining process. In other words it is not consistent with\nArticle 4 for employers and workers to be denied the right to engage in\ncollective bargaining if they wish to do so\u2014bearing in mind that it is not\ninconsistent with the Convention to deny these rights to members of the police\nor the armed forces and that \u201cthe Convention does not deal with the position\nof public servants engaged in the administration of the State\u201d. Not only must\nthe parties be free to engage in collective bargaining if they so choose, but\nthey must be permitted to reach their own agreement on their own terms without\ninterference by the public authorities \u2013 subject to certain qualifications for\n\u201ccompelling reasons of national economic interest\u201d (ILO 1994) and to\nreasonable requirements as to form, registration and so on.\nArticle 4 has not, however, been interpreted as protecting the right to\nrecognition for purposes of collective bargaining. The supervisory bodies have\nrepeatedly emphasized the desirability of such recognition, but have not been\nprepared to take the further step of determining that refusal to recognize\nand/or the absence of a mechanism whereby employers can be obliged to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong constitutes a breach of\nArticle 4 (ILO 1994b; ILO 1995a). They have justified this interpretation on\nthe basis that compulsory recognition would deprive collective bargaining of\nits voluntary character as envisaged by Article 4 (ILO 1995a). As against\nthat, it might be argued that the ostensible right to engage in collective\nbargaining must inevitably be compromised if employers are to be free to\nrefuse to engage in such bargaining notwithstanding that they have the right\nso to bargain if they wish. Furthermore, permitting employers to refuse to\nrecognize the unions to which their employees belong seems to sit somewhat\nuneasily with the duty to \u201cpromote\u201d collective bargaining, which appears to be\nthe principal purpose of Article 4 (Creighton 1994).\nIt was suggested earlier that ILO standards relating to occupational safety\nand health endorse the concept of bipartite or tripartite involvement in three\nprincipal contexts: (1) the formulation and implementation of policy at\nnational and regional level; (2) consultation between employers and workers at\nthe level of the workplace; and (3) joint participation between employers and\nworkers in the formulation and implementation of policy at the level of the\nworkplace. It should be clear from the foregoing that the effective\ninvolvement of employers and (especially) workers in all three contexts is\ncrucially dependent upon adequate recognition of their rights of association\nand representation.\nRespect for the right to form and to join organizations is clearly an\nessential precondition of all three forms of joint involvement. Consultation\nand participation at the governmental level is feasible only where there are\nstrong and effective organizations which can be seen to be representative of\nthe interests of their constituencies. This is necessary both for ease of\ncommunication and so that government will feel constrained to take seriously\nthe views expressed by the representatives of employers and workers. A\nfortiori, consultation and participation at the level of the workplace is a\nrealistic proposition only if workers have the capacity to form and to join\norganizations which can represent their interests in discussions with\nemployers and their organizations, provide back-up resources for worker\nrepresentatives, assist in dealings with public inspectorates and so on.\nTheoretically, worker representatives could operate at the level of the\nworkplace without having any necessary connection with a more broadly based\norganization, but the reality of power relations in most workplaces is such\nthat they are unlikely to be able to do so in an effective manner without the\nsupport of an industrial organization. At the very least, workers must have\nthe right to have their interests represented in this manner if they so\nchoose.\nThe organizational autonomy of employer and worker organizations is also an\nessential precondition of meaningful participation at all levels. It is\nnecessary, for example, that worker organizations should have the right to\nformulate and to implement their policies on occupational safety and health\nissues without outside interference, for purposes of consultation with\ngovernment in relation to: (1) issues such as the legal regulation of\nhazardous processes or substances; or (2) the formulation of legislative\npolicy relating to compensation for work-related injury or the rehabilitation\nof injured workers. Such autonomy is even more important at the level of the\nworkplace, where worker organizations need to develop and maintain a capacity\nto represent the interests of their members in discussion with employers on\noccupational safety and health issues. This might include having rights of\naccess to workplaces for union officials and/or health and safety specialists;\ninvoking the assistance of the public authorities in relation to hazardous\nsituations; and in certain circumstances organizing industrial action in order\nto protect the health and safety of their members.\nTo be effective, organizational autonomy also requires that trade union\nmembers and officials be accorded adequate protection against victimization on\ngrounds of their trade union membership or activities, or on account of their\nhaving initiated or participated in legal proceedings relating to occupational\nsafety and health matters. In other words, the guarantees against\ndiscrimination set out in Article 1 of Convention No. 98 are as relevant to\ntrade union activity relating to occupational safety and health as to other\nforms of union activity such as collective bargaining, membership recruitment\nand so on.\nThe right to engage in autonomous collective bargaining is also a crucial\nelement in effective worker participation in relation to occupational safety\nand health. The guarantees set out in Article 4 of Convention No. 98 are\nimportant in this context. However, as indicated, those guarantees do not\nextend to the right to be recognized for purposes of such bargaining. On the\nother hand provisions such as Article 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155) may be seen as coming very close to requiring trade\nunion recognition in the context of occupational safety and health:\nThere shall be arrangements at the level of the undertaking under which:\n\u00b7 representatives of workers in an undertaking are given adequate information\non measures taken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and\nmay consult their representative organizations about such information provided\nthey do not disclose commercial secrets;\n\u00b7 workers and their representatives in the undertaking are given appropriate\ntraining in occupational safety and health;\n\u00b7 workers or their representatives and, as the case may be, their\nrepresentative organizations in an undertaking, in accordance with national\nlaw and practice, are enabled to inquire into, and are consulted by the\nemployer on, all aspects of occupational safety and health associated with\ntheir work...\nIn practical terms it would be very difficult to give effect to these\nprovisions without according some kind of formal recognition to the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. This in turn serves to emphasize yet again the\nimportance of adequate recognition of rights of association and representation\nas a precondition of the development and implementation of effective\noccupational safety and health strategies at both the national and enterprise\nlevel.\nMichael J. Wright\nCollective bargaining is the process through which workers negotiate, as a\ngroup, with their employer; this can occur at various levels (enterprise,\nindustry/sector, national). Traditionally, the subjects of the negotiation are\nwages, benefits, working conditions and fair treatment. However, collective\nbargaining can also address issues that do not directly affect the workers\nemployed in the enterprise, such as increased old-age pensions for workers\nalready retired. Less often, collective bargaining addresses issues that reach\nwell beyond the workplace, such as protection of the external environment.\nIn a very small enterprise, it is possible for all the workers to negotiate as\na body with their employer. This kind of informal collective bargaining has\nexisted for centuries. Today, however, most collective bargaining is carried\nout by workers\u2019 organizations, or unions.\nThe definition used in the ILO Convention concerning the promotion of\ncollective bargaining, 1981 (No.154), Article 2, is broad:\nthe term... extends to all negotiations which take place between an employer,\na group of employers or one or more employers\u2019 organizations, on the one hand,\nand one or more workers\u2019 organizations, on the other, for \u2013\n(a) determining working conditions and terms of employment; and/or\n(b) regulating relations between employers and workers; and/or\n(c) regulating relations between employers or their organizations and a\nworkers\u2019 organization or workers\u2019 organizations.\nCollective bargaining is an important tool for raising living standards and\nimproving working conditions. Even though safety and health is addressed in\nthe national law of almost all countries, collective bargaining often provides\nthe mechanism through which the law is implemented in the workplace. For\nexample, the law may mandate joint safety and health committees or works\ncouncils, but leave the details to be negotiated between the employer and the\nworkers\u2019 organization.\nUnfortunately, collective bargaining is under attack by authoritarian\nemployers and repressive governments, both in developed and developing\ncountries. It rarely exists in the informal sector or in small, traditional\nenterprises. As a result, the majority of the world\u2019s workers do not yet enjoy\nthe benefits of effective collective bargaining under a framework of worker\nrights guaranteed by law.\nThere is a long history of workers\u2019 organizations taking collective action for\nsafety and health. In 1775, Percival Pott, an English surgeon, made the first\nknown report of occupational cancer \u2013 skin cancer in London chimney sweeps\n(Lehman 1977). Two years later the Danish Chimney Sweepers Guild, in what was\nthe first known response by a workers\u2019 organization to the threat of\noccupational cancer, ordered that apprentices be given the means for a daily\nbath.\nHowever, safety and health seldom was an explicit issue in early labour\nstruggles. Workers in dangerous jobs were overwhelmed by more pressing\nproblems, such as low wages, crushing hours of work and the arbitrary power of\nfactory and mine owners. Safety hazards were obvious in the daily toll of\ninjury and death, but occupational health was not well understood. Workers\u2019\norganizations were weak and under constant attack by owners and governments.\nSimple survival was the primary goal of workers\u2019 organizations. As a result,\nthe grievances of nineteenth-century workers rarely manifested themselves in\ncampaigns for safer conditions (Corn 1978).\nThe agreement between Bethlehem Steel and the United Steelworkers of America\nis typical of company-wide agreements in large unionized manufacturing\nenterprises in the United States. Steel industry labour agreements have\ncontained safety and health articles for more than 50 years. Many provisions\nnegotiated in the past gave workers and the union rights that were later\nguaranteed by law. Despite this redundancy, the provisions still appear in the\ncontract as a hedge against changes in the law, and to allow the union the\noption of taking violations to impartial arbitration rather than the courts.\nThe Bethlehem agreement runs from 1 August 1993 to 1 August 1999. It covers\n17,000 workers in six plants. The full agreement is 275 pages long; 17 pages\nare devoted to safety and health.\nSection 1 of the safety and health article pledges the company and the union\nto cooperate in the objective of eliminating accidents and health hazards. It\nobligates the company to provide safe and healthful workplaces, obey federal\nand state law, provide employees with the necessary protective equipment free\nof charge, provide chemical safety information to the union and inform workers\nof the hazards and controls for toxic substances. It grants the union\u2019s\ncentral safety and health department the right to any information in the\ncompany\u2019s possession that is \u201crelevant and material\u201d to an understanding of\npotential hazards. It requires the company to make air sampling tests and\nenvironmental investigations at the request of the union co-chairperson of the\nplant\u2019s safety and health committee.\nSection 2 sets up joint union-management safety and health committees at the\nplant and national levels, prescribes the rules under which they operate,\nmandates training for committee members, gives members of the committee access\nto all parts of the plant to facilitate the committee\u2019s work and specifies the\napplicable rates of pay for committee members on committee business. The\nsection also specifies how disputes over protective equipment are to be\nresolved, requires the company to notify the union of all potentially\ndisabling accidents, sets up a system of joint accident investigation,\nrequires the company to gather and supply to the union certain safety and\nhealth statistics, and establishes an extensive safety and health training\nprogramme for all employees.\nSection 3 gives workers the right to remove themselves from work involving\nhazards beyond those \u201cinherent in the operation\u201d and provides an arbitration\nmechanism through which disputes over such work refusals can be resolved.\nUnder this provision, a worker cannot be disciplined for acting in good faith\nand on the basis of objective evidence, even if a subsequent investigation\nshows that the hazard did not in fact exist.\nSection 4 specifies that the committee\u2019s role is advisory, and that committee\nmembers and officers of the union acting in their official capacity are not to\nbe held liable for injuries or illnesses.\nSection 5 states that alcoholism and drug abuse are treatable conditions, and\nsets up a programme of rehabilitation.\nSection 6 establishes an extensive programme for controlling carbon monoxide,\na serious hazard in primary steel production.\nSection 7 provides workers with vouchers for the purchase of safety shoes.\nSection 8 requires the company to keep individual medical records confidential\nexcept in certain limited circumstances. However, workers have access to their\nown medical records, and may release them to the union or to a personal\nphysician. In addition, physicians for the company are required to notify\nworkers of adverse medical findings.\nSection 9 establishes a medical surveillance programme.\nSection 10 establishes a programme for investigating and controlling the\nhazards of video display terminals.\nSection 11 establishes full-time safety representatives in each plant, chosen\nby the union but paid by the company.\nIn addition, an appendix to the agreement commits the company and the union to\nreview each plant\u2019s safety programme for mobile equipment operating on rails.\n(Fixed rail equipment is the leading cause of death by traumatic injury in the\nAmerican steel industry.)\nHowever, safety and health sometimes joined other issues in early labour\nstruggles. In the late 1820s, workers in the textile industry in the United\nStates began to agitate for shorter working hours. Many of the workers were\nwomen, as were the leaders of such rudimentary unions as the female labour\nreform associations of New England. The proposed 10-hour day was seen mostly\nas an issue of general welfare. But in testimony before the Massachusetts\nlegislature, workers also decried the effects of 12- and 14-hour days in badly\nventilated mills, describing a \u201cwasting sickness\u201d they attributed to cotton\ndust and bad ventilation, in what are now recognized as some of the first\nreports of byssinosis. They had little success in winning recognition from the\nmill owners, or action from the legislature (Foner 1977).\nOther union actions dealt more with the effects of occupational hazards than\nwith their prevention. Many nineteenth-century unions adopted welfare\nprogrammes for their members, including disability payments to the injured and\nbenefits for survivors. US and Canadian mining unions went one step further,\nestablishing hospitals, clinics and even cemeteries for their members\n(Derickson 1988). While unions attempted to negotiate better conditions with\nemployers, most agitation for safety and health in North America was in mines\naimed at state and provincial legislatures (Fox 1990).\nIn Europe, the situation began to change around the turn of the century with\nthe rise of stronger workers\u2019 organizations. In 1903, the German and French\npainters\u2019 unions began a campaign against the hazards of lead paint. The\nFactory Workers Union of Germany had an active industrial hygiene programme by\n1911, published education materials on chemical hazards and began a campaign\nfor safeguards against chromate-induced lung cancer, ultimately leading to a\nchange in the production method. Trade unions in the United Kingdom\nrepresented their members in workers\u2019 compensation cases and fought for better\nlaws and regulations. Their work showed the interplay between collective\nbargaining for safety and health and the factory inspection system. In 1905,\nfor example, trade unions filed 268 complaints with the British factory\ninspectorate (Teleky 1948). As early as 1942, the Swedish Employers\u2019\nConfederation and the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions reached a\nnationwide Working Environment Agreement regarding local safety and health\nservices. The agreement has been revised and extended several times; in 1976\nthe original parties were joined by the Federation of Salaried Employees\n(Joint Industrial Safety Council of Sweden 1988).\nNorth America lagged behind. Formal corporate safety programmes were\ninstituted by some large employers around the turn of the century (for a\ndescription of such programmes in the steel industry see Brody (1960), or the\nself-congratulatory Year Book of the American Iron and Steel Institute for\n1914 (AISI 1915)). The programmes were highly paternalistic, relied more on\ndiscipline than education and often were based on the premise that workers\nthemselves were largely to blame for industrial accidents. Major disasters\nsuch as New York\u2019s 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, which killed 146 workers,\nled to union campaigns for improvement and ultimately to improved fire safety\nlaws. However, safety and health as a widespread labour issue came only with\nthe rise of strong unions in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1942, for example, the\nfounding Constitution of the United Steelworkers of America required every\nlocal union to establish a safety and health committee. By the mid-1950s,\njoint labour-management safety and health committees had been established in\nmost unionized mines and manufacturing plants and in many other workplaces in\nthe construction and service sector; most union contracts included a section\non safety and health.\nIt is common to think of collective bargaining as a formal process that occurs\nat regular intervals and which results in a written agreement between the\nworkers\u2019 organization and the employer or employers. This kind of bargaining\npresupposes a succession of demands or proposals, counterproposals and\nextended deliberations. The process can produce a variety of results: a\ncollective bargaining contract, letters of understanding, joint declarations\nor mutually agreed codes of practice.\nHowever, collective bargaining can also be understood as a continuous process\nfor solving problems as they arise. This kind of collective bargaining occurs\nevery time a shop steward meets with an area supervisor to settle a dispute or\ngrievance, every time a joint safety and health committee meets to discuss\nproblems in the plant, every time a joint union-management team considers a\nnew company programme.\nIt is this flexibility of collective bargaining which helps ensure its\ncontinued viability. There is, however, one precondition for formal or\ninformal bargaining: for negotiations to be a success, the representatives of\nboth sides must have the authority to bargain and to strike a deal that is\nmeant to be honoured.\nCollective bargaining is sometimes seen as a test of strength, in which a gain\nfor one side is a loss for the other. A wage increase, for example, is seen as\na threat to profits. A no-layoff agreement is seen as limiting management\u2019s\nflexibility. If bargaining is seen as a contest, it follows that the most\nimportant determinant of the final outcome is the relative power of the\nparties. For the workers\u2019 organization, this means the ability to halt\nproduction through a strike, organize a boycott of the employer\u2019s product or\nservice or bring some other form of pressure to bear, while maintaining the\nloyalty of the organization\u2019s members. For an employer, power means the\nability to resist such pressures, replace the striking workers in countries\nwhere this is permitted or hold out until hardship forces workers back to the\njob under management\u2019s conditions.\nOf course, the vast majority of labour negotiations end successfully, without\na work stoppage. Nevertheless, it is the threat of one that leads both sides\nto seek a settlement. This kind of negotiation is sometimes called positional\nbargaining, because it begins with each side taking a position, after which\nboth sides move by increments until a compromise is reached, based on their\nrelative strengths.\nA second model of collective bargaining describes it as a mutual search for an\noptimum solution (Fisher and Ury 1981). This kind of bargaining assumes that a\nproper agreement can lead to gains for both parties. A wage increase, for\nexample, can be offset by greater productivity. A no-layoff agreement can\nencourage workers to improve efficiency, since their jobs will not be\nthreatened as a result. Such bargaining is sometimes called \u201cmutual gains\u201d or\n\u201cwin-win\u201d bargaining. What is most important is the ability of each side to\nunderstand the interests of the other and to find solutions that maximize\nboth. Occupational safety and health is frequently seen as an ideal subject\nfor mutual gains bargaining, since both sides are interested in avoiding\noccupational accidents and disease.\nIn practice, these models of bargaining are not mutually exclusive and both\nare important. Skilled bargainers will always seek to understand their\ncounterparts and search for areas where both sides can benefit from a wise\nagreement. However, it is unlikely that a party without power will accomplish\nits objectives. There will always remain areas where the parties perceive\ntheir interests to be different. Good faith negotiation works best when both\nsides fear the alternative.\nPower is important even in negotiations over safety and health. An enterprise\nmay be less interested in reducing the accident rate if it can externalize the\ncost of the accidents. If injured workers can be replaced easily and cheaply,\nwithout substantial compensation, management may be tempted to avoid expensive\nsafety improvements. This is especially true in the case of occupational\ndiseases with long latency periods, where cost of controls is paid when the\ncontrols are installed, while the benefits may not accrue for many years. As a\nresult, a workers\u2019 organization is more likely to succeed if workers have the\npower to stop production or to call a government inspector if the parties fail\nto negotiate a solution.\nILO Conventions on freedom of association, on protection of the rights to\norganize and to engage in collective bargaining and the ILO Conventions and\nRecommendations on occupational safety and health recognize the role of\nworkers\u2019 organizations. While these instruments provide an international\nframework, workers\u2019 rights can be assured only through national law and\nregulation.\nOf course, the legal basis for collective bargaining, the level at which\nbargaining occurs and even the process of bargaining all vary by country. The\nlegislation of most industrialized countries includes a system for regulating\ncollective bargaining. Even within Europe, the degree of regulation can differ\nwidely, from a minimal approach in Germany to a much more developed one in\nFrance. The legal effect of a collective agreement also varies. In most\ncountries an agreement is legally enforceable; in the United Kingdom, however,\nagreements are seen as informal, to be applied by virtue of the parties\u2019 good\nfaith backed up by the threat of a work stoppage. It is expected that this\nvariability within Europe will diminish as a result of greater European\nunification.\nThe level of bargaining also varies. The United States, Japan and most Latin\nAmerican countries feature bargaining at the level of the individual\nenterprise, although unions often attempt to negotiate \u201cpattern\u201d agreements\nwith all the major employers in a given sector. At the other extreme, Austria,\nBelgium and the Nordic countries tend to have highly centralized bargaining in\nwhich most workplaces are subject to a framework agreement negotiated between\nnational federations representing unions and employers. Sectoral agreements\ncovering particular industries or occupations are common in some countries\nsuch as Germany and France.\nFrench-speaking African countries tend to follow the example of France and\nbargain by industry. Some English-speaking developing countries also bargain\nby industry. In others, multiple trade unions bargain on behalf of different\ngroups of workers in a single enterprise.\nThe level of bargaining partially determines the coverage of collective\nagreements. In France and Germany, for example, collective agreements are\nusually extended to cover everyone coming within the scope of the occupation\nor industry to which the agreement applies. On the other hand, in the United\nStates and other countries with enterprise-level bargaining, collective\nagreements cover only those workplaces where the union has been recognized as\nthe bargaining agent.\nAn even more important factor in determining the coverage of collective\nbargaining is whether national law facilitates or impedes unionization and\ncollective bargaining. For example, public sector employees are not permitted\nto bargain collectively in some countries. In others, public sector unions are\ngrowing rapidly. As a result of such factors, the percentage of workers\ncovered by collective agreements varies from a high of almost 90 per cent in\nGermany and the Nordic countries to under 10 per cent in many developing\ncountries.\nThe legal framework also affects how collective bargaining applies to\noccupational safety and health. For example, the United States Occupational\nSafety and Health Act gives workers\u2019 organizations the right to information on\ndangerous chemicals and other hazards in the plant, the right to accompany a\nworkplace inspector and a limited right to participate in legal cases brought\nby the Government against an employer for a violation of standards.\nMany countries go further. Most industrialized countries require most\nenterprises to establish joint safety and health committees. The Canadian\nProvince of Ontario requires that certified safety and health representatives\nbe chosen by the workers in most workplaces and given a standard course of\ntraining at employer expense. The Swedish Work Environment Act requires the\nappointment of safety delegates by the local trade union organization. Swedish\nsafety delegates have broad rights to information and consultation. Most\nimportant, they have the power to suspend dangerous work pending a review by\nthe Swedish Labour Inspectorate.\nThese laws strengthen the collective bargaining process on issues of safety\nand health. Mandatory joint safety committees provide a routine mechanism for\nnegotiation. Training gives union representatives the knowledge they need to\nparticipate effectively. The right to suspend dangerous work helps keep both\nparties focused on eliminating the source of danger.\nOf course, labour agreements are of limited value without an enforcement\nmechanism. A strike is one method by which a workers\u2019 organization can respond\nto an alleged violation by the employer; conversely, the employer can engage\nin a lockout, denying employment to members of the workers\u2019 organization until\nthe dispute is resolved. However, most labour agreements in developed\ncountries rely on less disruptive methods of enforcement. In fact, many labour\nagreements bar strikes or lockouts during the life of the agreement (no-strike\nclauses or peace obligations). Some restrict them to a limited set of\ncircumstances; for example, the contracts negotiated in the United States\nbetween the United Automobile Workers and the major auto companies allow\nstrikes over unsafe working conditions, but not over wages or benefits during\nthe term of the agreement.\nA common enforcement mechanism in developed countries is a system of\narbitration, in which disputes are referred to an impartial referee chosen\njointly by the employer and the workers\u2019 organization. In some cases, disputes\nmay be resolved by the judicial system, either in the regular courts or in\nspecial labour courts or boards. In the United States, for example, a dispute\nover contract interpretation usually will go to arbitration. However, if the\nlosing side refuses to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the winning side\ncan seek to have the decision enforced by the courts. A quasi-judicial body in\nthe United States, the National Labor Relations Board, hears complaints\nconcerning unfair labour practices, such as the failure of one side to bargain\nin good faith. In many other countries, labour courts fulfil this role.\nCollective bargaining is a dynamic process in all industrial relations systems\nwhere it is practised. The situation in Europe is changing rapidly. The Nordic\ncountries are characterized by comprehensive working environment agreements\nnegotiated on a national basis, integrated with highly developed national\nlaws. Unionization is very high; labour agreements and the law establish joint\ncommittees and worker safety representatives in most workplaces. Collective\nbargaining mechanisms for safety and health and unionization rates, are less\nextensive in other European countries. Member States of the European Union\nface the task of harmonizing national laws under the Single European Act and\nthe Framework Directive on safety and health (Hecker 1993). European trade\nunions are seeking to coordinate their efforts, primarily through the European\nTrade Union Confederation. There are some signs that national bargaining\nultimately will be replaced or, more likely, supplemented by agreements at the\nEuropean level, although employer resistance to this is high. The first\nexample of such Europe-wide bargaining was over parental leave. In the area of\nsafety and health, the GMB union in the United Kingdom has proposed an\nambitious Europe-wide Work Environment Fund, based on similar funds in the\nNordic Countries.\nCentral and Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, are\nchanging even more rapidly. Safety and health regulations were extensive under\nCommunism, but rarely enforced. Trade unions existed, but only under the\ncontrol of the Communist Party. At the enterprise level, unions functioned as\nworkplace labour relations departments, under the control of management,\nwithout any sort of bipartite negotiation. Newly formed independent unions\nhelped precipitate the fall of Communism; sometimes their issues concerned\nworking conditions or such basic sanitary measures as the provision of soap in\ncoal mine wash houses. Today, the old unions are gone or are struggling to\nreconstitute themselves. The new independent unions are attempting to change\nfrom political organizations confronting the government, to collective\nbargaining organizations representing their members in the workplace. Bad and\noften deteriorating working conditions will continue to be an important issue.\nThe Japanese system of worker participation, continuous improvement and\nextensive training effectively promotes safety and health, but only where\nsafety and health are explicit goals of the enterprise. Most Japanese unions\nexist only at the enterprise level; negotiations take place through a system\nof continuous joint consultation (Inohara 1990). Joint safety and health\ncommittees are established by the Labour Safety and Sanitation Law of 1972, as\namended.\nLabour agreements in the United States contain relatively extensive safety and\nhealth articles for two reasons. First, safety and health is an important\nissue for North American unions, as it is for workers\u2019 organizations in all\nindustrialized countries. However, safety and health laws in the United States\nlack many of the provisions found in the laws of other countries, forcing\nunions to bargain for rights and protections guaranteed elsewhere by law. For\nexample, joint union-management safety and health committees are generally\nrecognized as an important mechanism for day-to-day cooperation and\nnegotiation between workers and employers. However, there is no requirement in\nthe US Occupational Safety and Health Act for such committees. As a result,\nunions must bargain for them. And since the rate of unionization is low in the\nUnited States, most workers do not have access to joint committees. Many\nunions in the United States also have negotiated contract clauses barring\nretaliation against workers who refuse to work under abnormally hazardous\nconditions, since legal protections are weak and uncertain.\nCanadian law varies from province to province, although it is generally\nstronger than in the United States. For example, unions in Canada do not need\nto negotiate for the existence of safety and health committees, although they\nmay negotiate for larger ones, with more powers. Safety and health committees\nare also required under Mexican law.\nThe situation in developing countries is mixed. Workers\u2019 organizations in\ndeveloping countries like India, Brazil and Zimbabwe place a growing emphasis\non safety and health through agitation for improved laws and through\ncollective bargaining. For example, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has\nfought to extend the national labour code, including its safety and health\nprovisions, to the country\u2019s export processing zones (see box). But trade\nunions are severely restricted or suppressed in many parts of the world and\nthe vast majority of workers in developing countries do not belong to any\nworkers\u2019 organization or benefit from collective bargaining.\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), has launched a National Campaign\nfor the Rights of Injured Workers, which combines national level and shop\nfloor action to seek amended laws and improved collective agreements.\nZimbabwean law has since 1990 provided for safety committees, health and\nsafety representatives and health and safety supervisors at all workplaces.\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has insisted that worker health and\nsafety representatives must be elected by workers. Its National Campaign\ncovers these demands:\n1\\. Safe work. This involves identification of workplace hazards through\nsurveys and accident investigation, as well as negotiating to improve\nconditions.\n2\\. Worker and union participation in workers\u2019 health issues. This includes\nthe rights of workers to elect their own health and safety representatives, to\nobtain information such as safety data sheets and factory inspector\u2019s reports,\nand jointly to investigate and report accidents and injuries (as in Sweden).\n3\\. Adequate compensation and care for injured workers. This extends to a\nreview of compensation levels.\n4\\. Job security for injured workers. Trade union representatives have\nnegotiated a right to return to work and be assisted in placement.\nFor the ZCTU, a key step in accident prevention has been its training\nprogramme to increase effective worker participation in health and safety at\nthe shop floor level. The training for worker representatives has been in\ncarrying out walk-through surveys at workplaces and in reporting on any\nhazards identified \u2013 first to workers and then to management for discussion.\nOnce in operation, union health and safety representatives have been involved\nin inspections and in ensuring that injuries are reported. This is\nparticularly important in sectors that would otherwise be inaccessible, such\nas agriculture.\nThe ZCTU has also demanded an increase in penalties that may be imposed on\nemployers found to have infringed health and safety laws.\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Loewenson 1992).\nWorkers\u2019 organizations and collective bargaining face difficult challenges in\nthe years ahead. Virtually all collective bargaining takes place at the\nenterprise, industry or national level. In contrast, the economy is\nincreasingly global. Apart from Europe, however, workers\u2019 organizations have\nyet to develop effective mechanisms for bargaining across national boundaries.\nSuch bargaining is a top priority for international labour federations. It can\nbest be promoted through stronger and more effective international union\nstructures, strong social clauses in world trade agreements and appropriate\ninternational instruments, such as those of the International Labour\nOrganization. For example, the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Multinational\nEnterprises refers specifically to both collective bargaining and occupational\nsafety and health. Many unions are developing direct links with their\ncounterparts in other countries in order to coordinate their bargaining and\nprovide mutual assistance. One example is the relationship between mining\nunions in the United States and Colombia (Zinn 1995).\nRapid changes in technology and work organization can overwhelm existing\nlabour agreements. Workers\u2019 organizations are attempting to develop a form of\ncontinuous bargaining to respond to workplace change. Workers\u2019 organizations\nhave long recognized the links between the working environment and the\nexternal environment. Some unions have begun to address issues of the external\nenvironment in their collective bargaining agreements and in their membership\neducation programmes. An example is the Model Environment Agreement proposed\nby the Manufacturing-Science-Finance (MSF) Union in the United Kingdom.\nA fundamental purpose of trade unions is to take human rights and human\nwelfare out of economic competition \u2013 to prevent an enterprise or a nation\nfrom seeking a competitive advantage by impoverishing its workers and forcing\nthem to work under dangerous conditions. Collective bargaining is vital to\nsafety and health. However, workers\u2019 organizations are essential to collective\nbargaining and workers\u2019 organizations are under attack in many developed and\ndeveloping countries. The survival and growth of workers\u2019 organizations will\nlargely determine whether most workers enjoy rising living standards and\nimproved working conditions, or face a deteriorating cycle of poverty, injury\nand disease.\nRobert Husbands\nCooperation between workers, employers and government in the elaboration and\nimplementation of occupational health and safety measures at the national or\nregional level is common in a significant number of countries. It is not\nunusual for interest groups and technical experts also to be involved in this\nprocess. Such cooperation is highly developed and has been institutionalized\nin a number of countries by the establishment of consultative and\ncollaborative organizations. These organizations have normally been widely\naccepted by all labour market participants as there appears to be a general\nconsensus that health and safety at work is a subject of common concern where\ndialogue between the social partners, the government and other interested\nparties is extremely important.\nThe institutions which have been established to facilitate this cooperation\nvary significantly in form. One approach is to establish consultative\norganizations either on an ad hoc or a permanent basis to give advice to the\ngovernment on questions of occupational safety and health policy. The\ngovernment is normally not obligated to follow the recommendations offered,\nbut in practice they are difficult to ignore and are frequently taken into\nconsideration in the elaboration of government policy.\nThe other approach is to have the social partners and other interested parties\nactively cooperate with the government in public institutions which have been\nestablished to implement occupational safety and health policy. Participation\nby non-governmental actors in public institutions with responsibility for\nhealth and safety questions at work is normally undertaken through the\nrepresentation of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and, in some cases,\nother parties, on the board of directors of the public institution concerned,\nalthough sometimes participation extends to the management and even the\nproject level. In most cases these persons are nominated by the government on\nrecommendation of the parties to be represented, although in some cases\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the right to directly nominate\ntheir representatives to these collaborative institutions. Bodies at the\nnational level (or regional, state or provincial level) are normally\ncomplemented by structures or arrangements at the industry, enterprise and\nplant level.\nProbably the most common form of cooperation involves the establishment of\nconsultative organizations to give advice on policy and standard setting.\nExamples of this can vary between a modest approach, which involves the\nexpenditure of relatively few resources, to more institutionalized approaches,\nwhich involve more significant amounts of resources. The United States is an\nexample of a country where a more limited approach has been adopted. At the\nfederal level, the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and\nHealth, established pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of\n1970, is the principal permanent advisory committee. This committee, according\nto the Act, is to be composed of representatives of management, labor,\noccupational safety and health professionals and the public, with a member of\nthe public acting as the chairperson. The committee makes recommendations to\nthe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In\npractice, however, this committee has not met frequently. The members of the\ncommittee are not compensated and the Secretary of Labor has provided from its\nbudget an executive secretary and other support services as needed. The costs\nof maintaining this committee in existence are therefore very low, although\nbudgetary constraints now call even this support into question. A permanent\ncommittee of a similar character, the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational\nSafety and Health, was established in July 1971 pursuant to Executive Order\n11612 to advise the Secretary of Labour on matters relating to the safety and\nhealth of federal workers.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 also provides for the\nestablishment of ad hoc advisory committees to assist in standard-setting\nfunctions. These advisory committees are appointed by the Secretary of Labor\nand are to consist of no more than 15 members, including one or more persons\nwho are designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Each\nstandard-setting committee is to include an equal number of representatives of\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. The Secretary of Labor may also appoint\none or more representatives of state health and safety agencies, as well as\ntechnical experts who could be, for example, representatives of professional\norganizations of technicians or professionals specializing in occupational\nhealth or safety, or of nationally recognized standards-producing\norganizations. Extensive use has been made of such standard-setting\ncommittees, which are sometimes in existence several years to accomplish the\nwork that has been assigned to them. Meetings can be frequent, depending on\nthe nature of the tasks to be performed. Although committee members are\nnormally not paid, they are normally reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses\nand support services for the activity of these committees have been paid for\nby the Department of Labor as well in the past. Committees have been\nconstituted to recommend standards with respect to agriculture, asbestos dust,\ncarcinogens, coke oven emissions, cutaneous hazards, hazardous materials\nlabelling, heat stress, marine terminal facilities, noise, longshoring safety\nand health, shipyard employment standards and steel erection rules, among\nother things.\nOther ad hoc advisory committees of a similar character have been established\npursuant to similar legislation which falls under the authority of the\nSecretary of Labor. For example, a number of standard-setting committees have\nbeen established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\nThe costs involved in the establishment of such standard-setting committees,\nhowever, are relatively modest and are characterized by relatively low\nadministrative costs, little infrastructure, voluntary participation by\noutside parties without compensation and dissolution of the committees upon\ncompletion of their tasks.\nMore elaborate institutionalized forms of consultation are, however, found in\nother countries. In the Netherlands, for example, the pre-eminent organization\nis the Working Environment Council, which was established pursuant to the\nWorking Environmental Council Act 1990. The Council gives its views to the\nMinistry of Social Affairs and Employment, either when asked or on its own\ninitiative, comments on proposed new acts and decrees and can bring forward\nits own proposals for new policy or legislation. The Council also gives its\nviews about the advisability of making grants-in-aid for research on working\nenvironment issues, about the issuance of exemptions, the formulation of\ngovernment guidance and the policy of the Labour Inspectorate. The Council is\ncomprised of eight representatives from central employers\u2019 organizations,\neight from central workers\u2019 organizations and seven from governmental bodies.\nOnly the representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations have the\nright to vote, however, and the chairperson of the Council is independent. The\nCouncil meets every month. In addition, the Council has approximately 15\ndifferent working committees for specific issues and, in addition, ad hoc\nworking groups are established for detailed subjects when the subject matter\njustifies it. Within the working committees and working groups, external\nexperts play an important role and these working organizations prepare reports\nand papers which are discussed at Council meetings and often form the basis\nfor positions which are subsequently taken. The recommendations of the Council\nare comprehensive and are published. Although normally the parties try to\nachieve a consensus position, separate views can be expressed to the Minister\nof Social Affairs and Employment when employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives\ncannot find common ground. More than 100 persons are involved in the work of\nthe Council and its subsidiary organizations and thus it is supported by\nsignificant financial and administrative resources.\nOther less prominent consultative organizations exist in the Netherlands for\nmore specific occupational safety and health issues. These include the\nFoundation for the Working Environment in Building Construction, the\nFoundation for Health Care in Agriculture, the Commission for the Prevention\nof Disasters by Dangerous Substances and the Commission for the Labour\nInspectorate and Enforcement Policy.\nExamples of other countries which have consultative organizations of a\nbipartite, tripartite or multipartite character to give recommendations on\noccupational safety and health policy and standards include: Canada (ad hoc\ncommittees on legislative reform and standard setting \u2013 federal level; Forum\nfor Action on Workplace Health and Safety \u2013 Alberta; Joint Steering Committee\non Hazardous Substances in the Workplace \u2013 Ontario; Back Injury Prevention\nAdvisory Committee \u2013 Newfoundland; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013\nPrince Edward Island; Advisory Council on Workplace Safety and Health \u2013\nManitoba; Occupational Health and Safety Council \u2013 Saskatchewan; Logging\nSafety Forum \u2013 British Columbia); Denmark (Working Environment Council);\nFrance (the Central Council for the Prevention of Occupational Risks and the\nNational Commission of Occupational Health and Safety in Agriculture); Italy\n(Permanent Consultative Commission for the Prevention of Work Accidents and\nOccupational Health); Germany (Advisory Board to the Federal Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health); and Spain (General Council of the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health).\nA number of countries have bipartite, tripartite or multipartite organizations\nwhich are also active in policy implementation. These collaborative\norganizations normally are public establishments which incorporate\nrepresentatives of employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and in some cases\nother persons or interest groups, in both policy making and policy\nimplementation. Normally far larger than advisory committees, councils or\ncommissions, these collaborative organizations have responsibility for\nimplementing government policy, frequently manage large budgetary resources\nand often have significant numbers of personnel.\nAn example of such an organization is the Health and Safety Commission in\nGreat Britain. The Commission was established pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Health and Safety Act 1974. It has as its mandate to ensure that adequate\nmeasures are taken to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons at\nwork; to protect the public against risks to health and safety arising out of\nwork; to control storage and use of explosives, highly flammable materials and\nother dangerous substances; and to control the emission of noxious or\noffensive substances from the workplace. It is responsible to the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment, but also to other Secretaries of State,\nincluding those of Trade and Industry, Transport, Environment and Agriculture.\nThe Commission has nine persons, all of whom are appointed by the Secretary of\nState for Education and Employment. It consists of a chairperson, three\nmembers appointed after consultation with the principal central employers\u2019\norganization, three members appointed after consultation with the principal\ncentral workers\u2019 organization and two members appointed after consultation\nwith local authority associations.\nThe Commission is assisted by a number of subsidiary organizations (figure\n21.3). The most important of these is the Health and Safety Executive, a\ndistinct statutory body which consists of a governing body of three persons\nappointed by the Commission with the approval of the Secretary of State for\nEducation and Employment. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for\ncarrying out the substantive work of the Commission, including the enforcement\nof health and safety standards under the Health and Safety Act 1974 and other\nfunctions delegated to it by the Commission. Local authorities also perform\nenforcement functions with respect to certain health and safety legislation as\nwell. In addition, the Commission is assisted in its work by a number of\nadvisory committees which are, depending on the committee, bipartite,\ntripartite or multipartite in character. These advisory committees are\norganized both by subject matter and industry. There are advisory committees\nfor each of the following subjects: toxic substances, dangerous pathogens,\ndangerous substances, genetic modifications, occupational health, releases to\nthe environment, nuclear installations and ionizing radiation. There are also\nadvisory committees for the following industries: agriculture, ceramics,\nconstruction, education, foundries, health, petroleum, paper and board,\nprinting, railways, rubber, cotton and textiles. Subject matter committees\ntend to have between 12 and 18 members plus a chairperson and are multipartite\nin character, frequently including technical experts as well as\nrepresentatives of central workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations, government\nand other interest groups. Industry committees, however, tend to be bipartite,\nwith approximately 12 members drawn in equal numbers from central workers\u2019 and\nemployers\u2019 organizations and with the chairperson being from the government.\nThe resources at the disposition of the Commission and the Health and Safety\nExecutive are substantial. For example, in 1993 these organizations together\nhad approximately 4,538 staff members and a budget of \u00a3 211.8 million.\n![](http://www.ilocis.org/documents/images/rel03fe.gif)\n\nOther examples of collaborative organizations in this field can be found in\nCanada. At the federal level, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and\nSafety is Canada\u2019s main resource for information on this topic. The Centre\nalso promotes health and safety in the workplace, facilitates the\nestablishment of high standards of occupational health and safety and assists\nin the development of programmes and policies to reduce or eliminate\noccupational hazards. The Centre, created by an act of parliament in 1978, was\ngiven a tripartite governing body to ensure its impartiality in occupational\nhealth and safety matters, including being an unbiased source of information.\nIts governing council consists of a chairperson and 12 governors \u2013 four\nrepresenting the federal, provincial and territorial governments; four\nrepresenting labour; and four representing employers. The Centre manages\nsignificant human and financial resources and its total expenditures in 1993\nwere approximately C$8.3 million.\n\nIn some provinces there are also collaborative organizations. In Quebec, two\nprominent organizations are the Commission for Occupational Health and Safety\nand the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research. The Commission\nhas two functions. The first is to develop and implement occupational health\nand safety policy, including the establishment of standards and their\nenforcement; the provision of support for the implementation of prevention\nprogrammes, participation mechanisms and health services; and the provision of\ntraining, information and research services. The second is to provide payment\nto workers injured on the job and to manage an insurance fund for this purpose\nto which employers must contribute. The Commission, which was established by\nlaw in 1981 and which succeeded the Commission of Occupational Accidents\nfounded in 1931, has a bipartite board of directors which is composed of seven\nworkers\u2019 representatives, seven representatives of employers and a\nchairperson. The representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations are\nchosen from lists supplied by the most representative labour and employer\norganizations. The Commission manages large human and financial resources and\nat the end of 1992 had expenditures of C$2,151.7 million and employed 3,013\npersons as permanent staff and 652 as casual employees.\n\nQuebec\u2019s Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research, founded in\n1980, has as its mandate to contribute, through scientific research, to the\nidentification and the elimination of sources of workplace hazards, as well as\nto the readaptation of workers who have suffered workplace injuries. The board\nof directors of the Institute is the same as that of the Commission for\nOccupational Health and Safety, notwithstanding that it is an independent\ninstitution. The Institute also has a scientific council which has advisory\nfunctions and is composed of four representatives of workers\u2019 organizations,\nfour from employers\u2019 organizations, six representatives of the scientific and\ntechnical community and the Institute\u2019s Director General. In 1992, the\nInstitute had expenditures of C$17.9 million and approximately 126 employees.\n\nThe Ontario Workplace Health and Safety Agency, established in 1990 by\namendment of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, also has responsibility\nfor developing and implementing policy and for managing occupational health\nand safety programmes in Ontario. The governing body of the organization\nconsists of a bipartite board of 18 persons with nine representatives each\nfrom workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. Of these representatives, one\nrepresentative of labour and one of management serve as joint chief executive\nofficers. The resources of this organization are substantial \u2013 total\nexpenditures amounted to C$64.9 million in 1992.\n\nOne country with a long tradition of collaborative organizations in the field\nof occupational safety and health, Sweden, decided to reject this form of\norganization in 1992 and has subsequently used advisory organizations instead.\nIt should be added that this decision was not confined to occupational safety\nand health, but included all collaborative organizations of any kind in which\nrepresentatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations played a decision-\nmaking role at the national level. The impetus for this change came from the\nprincipal employers\u2019 organization, which decided unilaterally to withdraw from\nparticipation in collaborative public institutions. The central employers\u2019\norganization argued that interest groups should not have political\nresponsibility in terms of managing public institutions, but that the\ngovernment and parliament should have this political role and responsibility;\nthat the role of the employers\u2019 organization was to represent its members\u2019\ninterests, and that this role could be in conflict with a duty to serve the\ninterests of the public institutions if the employers\u2019 organization was\nrepresented on the governing boards of such institutions; and that\nparticipation weakened democracy and the development of public institutions.\nAlthough workers\u2019 organizations were not in agreement with the employers\u2019\norganizations on these points, the government concluded that collaborative\nbodies with no representation from the principal employers\u2019 organization were\nimpractical and decided to have representation by workers\u2019 and employers\u2019\norganizations as well as other interest groups only on advisory bodies. Hence,\norganizations in the field of occupational safety and health such as the\nNational Board of Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of\nOccupational Health and the Working Life Fund, which had formerly been\ncollaborative in character in terms of a tripartite or multipartite governing\nboard, were restructured.\n\nAlthough collaborative organizations in most countries are more rare than\nadvisory organizations, which are quite widespread, the case of Sweden\u2019s\nrejection of collaborative institutions, at least in the field of occupational\nsafety and health, appears to be an isolated one. Although some collaborative\ninstitutions, dealing notably with questions of economic policy, training and\nemployment, were dismantled in Great Britain during the 1980s and 1990s by\nsuccessive conservative governments, the Health and Safety Commission was not\naffected. Some have advanced that this is because occupational safety and\nhealth is a subject of common concern to employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations\nas well as the government and other interested parties and therefore there is\na strong interest by all parties in finding a consensus in both policy\nformulation and implementation. Also, in Canada such collaborative\ninstitutions have been created at both the federal level and in some provinces\nprecisely because a collaborative approach was deemed more useful in finding a\nconsensus between the labour market parties and because administration of the\noccupational safety and health laws would appear more impartial and fair to\nthose affected by them.\n\nOn a broader level, however, there are two national consultative bodies which\nare also concerned with occupational safety and health issues as part of their\nmore general mandate to address all important social and economic questions of\nnational importance. In the Netherlands, the Labour Foundation, established in\nMay 1945, is a bipartite organization jointly managed by equal numbers of\nrepresentatives from central employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations (including\nfarmers) and has a significant role as an advisory body to the Government.\nAlthough historically its main function has concerned questions of wage\npolicy, it also expresses its views on other conditions of work. The other\nnational consultative body of importance is the Social and Economic Council,\nwhich was founded in 1950 pursuant to the Act on Statutory Trade Associations.\nThe tripartite Council consists of 15 representatives of central employers\u2019\norganizations, 15 representatives of central workers\u2019 organizations and 15\nindependent experts. The employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives are appointed\nby their organizations and the independent experts are appointed by the Crown.\nIn making its appointments, the Crown also tries to have a balance between the\nmajor political parties. The Council is independent of the government and is\nfinanced by a mandatory tax on employers.\n\nThe Council has a multimillion dollar budget and its own Secretariat. The\nCouncil normally meets once a month and is assisted by a number of permanent\nand ad hoc committees, which are frequently also constituted on a tripartite\nbasis. The government is required by law to submit all proposals for social\nand economic legislation to the Council for its advice and any labour\nlegislation \u2013 which would include proposals concerning occupational safety and\nhealth \u2013 comes before the Council.\n\nIt should be added that a number of countries require that workplace health\nand safety committees should or may be established for enterprises which have\nmore than a certain number of employees. These committees are bipartite in\nnature and include representatives of the employers and the workers. These\ncommittees normally have as their function to investigate and propose all ways\nand means of actively contributing to measures undertaken to ensure the best\npossible health and safety conditions in the establishment, a role which can\ninclude the promotion and monitoring of health and safety conditions in the\nenterprise to ensure, among other things, adherence to applicable law and\nregulations. These joint committees are normally advisory in character.\nWorkplace health and safety committees, for example, are legally required in\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.\n\n## FORMS OF WORKERS\u2019 PARTICIPATION\n\nMuneto Ozaki and Anne Trebilcock\n\nThe phrase workers\u2019 participation is used loosely to encompass various forms\nof workers\u2019 participation in decision making, usually at the enterprise level.\nThey complement other forms that may exist at the industrial or sectoral level\nand the national level, such as bodies for tripartite cooperation. The types\nof workers\u2019 participation arrangement differ widely with regard to their\nfunctions and powers, ranging from informal individual employee suggestion\nschemes to co-determination of certain matters by workers\u2019 representatives\ntogether with management. The mechanisms used for encouraging employee\nparticipation vary so widely that it is impossible to review them fully here.\nThe main forms that have attracted recent interest, particularly in the field\nof work organization, are reviewed below; to these could be added the\nhistorical example of self-management by workers in former Yugoslavia. As\nparticularly relevant today, joint safety and health committees are examined\nas a special form of workers\u2019 participation within the larger labour relations\ncontext.\n\nThe idea of workers\u2019 participation arose in Europe, where collective\nbargaining has usually been at the branch or industry level; this often left a\ngap of employee representation at the enterprise or plant level, which became\nfilled by bodies such as works councils, works committees, enterprise\ncommittees and so forth. Many developing countries have also adopted\nlegislative initiatives with a view to having works councils or similar\nstructures set up (e.g., Pakistan, Thailand, Zimbabwe) as a means of promoting\nlabour-management cooperation. The relationship of these bodies to trade\nunions and collective bargaining has been the subject of considerable\nlegislation and negotiation. This is reflected in a provision of the ILO\nWorkers\u2019 Representatives Convention, 1971 (No. 135), which states that where\nboth trade union representatives and elected representatives exist in the same\nundertaking, measures shall be taken to ensure that the existence of those\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade union\n(Article 5).\n\n### Direct Participation\n\nWorkers may participate in decision making either directly themselves or\nindirectly through their representatives \u2013 trade unions or elected employee\nrepresentatives. Since the 1980s, there has been a spread of direct\nparticipation by workers, if the term participation is understood as the\nexercise of any influence on their work or how it is to be carried out. Thus\nworkers may \u201cparticipate\u201d in work-related decisions not only when there is an\ninstitution, such as a quality circle, at the workplace. Accordingly, a simple\nexercise of work enrichment may be a form of promoting direct participation of\nworkers.\n\nDirect participation may be on an individual basis \u2013 for example, through\nsuggestion schemes or \u201cenriched\u201d work. It may also be on a group basis \u2013 for\nexample, in quality circles or similar small-group activities. Teamwork in\nitself constitutes a form of group-based direct participation. Direct\nparticipation may be integrated into decisions about daily work, or it may\ntake place outside daily work, such as in a voluntary quality circle that cuts\nacross the group structure habitually used. Direct participation may also be\n\u201cconsultative\u201d or \u201cdeliberative\u201d; research by the European Foundation for the\nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions has explored this particular\naspect in some detail (Regalia and Gill 1996). With consultative\nparticipation, employees are encouraged and enabled, either as individuals or\nmembers of a group, to make their views known, but it is up to management to\naccept or reject their proposals. Deliberative participation, on the other\nhand, places some of traditional management responsibility in the employees\u2019\nhands, as in the case of teamworking or semi-autonomous work groups wherein\nsome authority has been delegated to the workers.\n\n### Works Councils and Similar Structures; Co-determination\n\nThe term works councils describes arrangements for the representation of\nemployees, usually at the plant level although they also exist at higher\nlevels (company, group of companies, industry, European Union). The\nrelationship to trade unions is often delineated by legislation or clarified\nby collective agreement, but tensions between these institutions sometimes\nremain all the same. Extensive use of works councils, sometimes called\nworkers\u2019 committees, cooperation committees or otherwise, is well established\nin a number of European countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany\nand the Netherlands and, under the impetus of Directive No. 94/45/EC of 1994\non European works councils, can be anticipated to spread in that region for\nlarge enterprises. Several Central and Eastern European countries, such as\nHungary and Poland, have enacted legislation to encourage the emergence of\nworks councils. They are found as well in some countries in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America; part of the post-apartheid labour law reform in South Africa,\nfor instance, included establishing a form of works councils alongside trade\nunion structures.\n\nThe possible powers of works councils are best illustrated by the example of\nGermany, although in some ways it is a unique case. Weiss (1992) describes the\nworks council in that country as the form of institutionalized representation\nof interests for employees within an establishment. A works council enjoys\ncertain rights to information, consultation (as in all countries) and co-\ndetermination (much more rare). As the most far-reaching form of\nparticipation, co-determination covers participation in arrangements on health\nand safety at work and the formal adoption of a reconciliation of interests\nand a \u201csocial plan\u201d in the event of a substantial alteration in the\nestablishment, such as a plant closure. Co-determination rights also extend to\nguidelines for staff selection and appraisal, in-service training and measures\naffecting individual workers such as grading, transfer and dismissal. The\nGerman works council is empowered to conclude works agreements at the\nenterprise level and can initiate complaints where it believes the agreement\nis not being honoured. Included in the areas of obligatory collective co-\ndetermination are accident prevention and health protection, works rules,\nworking time, the fixing of performance-related pay rates, the manner of\npayment, general principles governing holidays and others. On these matters,\nthe employer cannot take action without the works council\u2019s agreement. The\nworks council also has the right to take the initiative and can refer a matter\nto the establishment-level arbitration committee for enforcement. As Weiss\n(1992) characterizes it, the works council\u2019s role is \u201cparticipating in the\n\u2018how\u2019 after the employer has made a decision on the \u2018whether\u2019\u201d. The right to\nconsultation affords the works council a chance to play a part in the\ndecisions made by the employer, but failure to consult will not invalidate the\ndecision. The subjects on which consultation is required include protection\nagainst dismissal, protection against technical hazards, training and\npreparation of a social plan.\n\nThe works council must observe the principles of cooperation with the employer\nand the peace obligation (no work stoppages); it also must cooperate with\ntrade unions present and with the appropriate employers\u2019 organization. Works\ncouncils are bound to conduct their business impartially, without regard to\nrace, religion or creed, nationality, origin, political or union activity, sex\nor age of the employees. The employer provides the facilities for the works\ncouncil, funds it and is liable for its actions.\n\nWorks councils are elected separately for manual and non-manual workers in\nGermany. Special works council elections are held; while there is no legal\nconnection between these representatives and trade union officers in fact,\nthey often coincide. In Austria and Germany, special representation is ensured\nfor disabled workers and young workers and trainees.\n\nWorks council members receive no remuneration for this, but necessarily\nincurred expenses are reimbursed. Members are guaranteed retention of their\npay level and job grading after the term of office has expired and enjoy\nspecial protection against dismissal. They are entitled to release from work\nto conduct works council business and attend training. Such protections are in\nline with the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135), which calls for\nworkers\u2019 representatives in an undertaking to enjoy effective protection\nagainst any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their\nstatus or activities as a workers\u2019 representative (Article 1).\n\nMany countries feature less ambitious works council schemes that provide for\ninformation and consultation rights. Especially where trade unions have little\npresence on the shop floor level, there is considerable interest in\nintroducing works councils or workers\u2019 committees as a means for workers to\nhave a voice at the workplace level.\n\n### Quality Circles and Total Quality Management\n\nQuality circles and other similar group activities were rapidly introduced in\na large number of enterprises in some Western European countries (e.g., the\nUnited Kingdom and France) at the start of the 1980s and in the United States\na little earlier. They built upon \u201cQuality of Working Life\u201d (QWL) or\n\u201cHumanization of Work\u201d programmes that began in the early 1970s. Their spread\nwas considerably later in some other Western countries (e.g., Germany) and\nstill seems to be very limited in countries where joint project groups are the\npredominant means of dealing with work organization, such as Sweden. They were\nstimulated by a belief that Japan\u2019s ability to produce innovative and high-\nquality products at low cost had something to do with the way human resources\nwere managed in that country; quality circles were the most visible and easily\ntransplantable feature of Japanese human resource management. Quality circles\nare generally expected to produce two types of effect: one is the enhancement\nof quality and productivity and the other is the fostering of a sense of\nparticipation in work-related decisions among workers, leading to increased\njob satisfaction and better industrial relations. In Japan the emphasis has\nbeen placed more on the first aspect and in Europe and North America on the\nsecond. There are also structural differences: while circle leaders are\nnormally appointed by management in Japan, they are often elected in Germany.\nToday, the emphasis of QWL programmes is more on enhancing productivity and\ncompetitiveness (Ozaki 1996).\n\nIn some of the countries where quality circles were experimented with widely\nin the 1980s, such as France and the United Kingdom, there has been a certain\ndisenchantment with their relative ineffectiveness in producing the expected\nresults. Many circles disappeared a few years after their creation; many\nothers exist on paper, but are in fact moribund. The failure has been\nattributed to many factors \u2013 their tendency to create confusion in the normal\nlines of command, non-management control over membership, circles\u2019 determining\ntheir own agenda without heed for management priorities, lack of enthusiasm or\nhostility on the part of middle management, absence of durable commitment on\nthe part of top management and restriction of scope to minor work-related\nissues.\n\nRealization of these shortcomings led to the formation of a theory of \u201cTotal\nQuality Management\u201d (TQM). Certain principles of TQM have implications for\nemployee participation: all employees are to participate in the process of\nimproving the business, and responsibility for quality is to be assigned to\npeople who in fact control the quality of what they do. Thus TQM encourages\njob enlargement and enrichment leading to semi-autonomous work groups. It also\npromotes horizontal coordination in a firm through, for example, the use of ad\nhoc, multi-functional or interdepartmental project teams.\n\n### Joint Project Groups\n\nThe practice of establishing joint project groups to study the best ways of\nintroducing technological or organizational changes through the joint efforts\nof managers and workers is a traditional feature of labour relations in some\ncountries, such as Sweden. A joint project group is normally composed of\nmanagers, workplace union representatives and shop-floor workers and often\nassisted by outside experts. The management and the union concerned often\nestablish joint project groups separately on four issues: new technology, work\norganization, training and work environment. The Swedish model of joint\nproject groups presents a notable example of direct participation of shop-\nfloor workers within a framework of established collective labour relations.\nThe system is also found in other countries, such as Germany and Japan.\n\n### Semi-autonomous Group Work and Teamwork\n\nSemi-autonomous group work and teamwork are both forms of on-line direct\nparticipation of shop-floor workers in work-related decisions, unlike the\nabove-mentioned joint project group work, which is a form of off-line\nparticipation. The main difference between the two forms of participation lies\nin the degree of autonomy which the members of the team or group enjoy in\norganizing their work. Semi-autonomous group work was used extensively in\nScandinavia, although recently there has been a move back to a more\ntraditional approach; there have been experiments with it elsewhere in Europe\nas well.\n\nWhile experiments with semi-autonomous group work are generally declining,\nteamwork is spreading fast throughout Western countries. The degree of\nautonomy which a team enjoys varies widely from one company to another. Team\nstructure also differs. In many countries, team leaders are usually appointed\nby management, but in a few countries (e.g., Germany) they are often elected\nby co-workers. Frequently, the creation of teams is accompanied by significant\nchanges in the role of first-line supervisors; they tend to take on greater\nresponsibility for advising team members and for both vertical and horizontal\ncommunication, but lose their supervisory role. Employers have shown\nincreasing interest in teamwork because it tends to facilitate the upgrading\nof workers\u2019 skills and widens the range of workers\u2019 tasks, thus allowing\ngreater flexibility in production processes. However, it is sometimes\ncriticized by workers as a means of inducing them to work harder \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\nby substituting co-workers\u2019 pressure for management control.\n\n### Employee Representation on Supervisory Boards; Employee Shareholding\n\nSome commentators include forms of employee ownership or representation on\ncompany boards as expressions of workers\u2019 participation. In Germany and the\nScandinavian countries, among others, workers have indirect participation\nabove the enterprise level by the inclusion of workers\u2019 representatives on\nsupervisory boards. This involves incorporating workers\u2019 representatives in\nthe traditional company board structure, where they are in a minority\n(although sometimes, as in Germany, a numerous one). It does not necessarily\nimply participation in the active management of the company and the workers\u2019\nrepresentatives have the same status as other board members. This means they\nare to put the interests of the company first and foremost and are bound by\nthe same duty of secrecy as other board members. Holding positions on the\nboard may provide access to additional information, however, and a number of\ntrade unions have sought the right to have workers\u2019 representatives on boards.\nIt is a phenomenon now seen in Eastern and Western Europe and North America,\nbut remains rather rare elsewhere.\n\nAnother expression of workers\u2019 participation is as owners of shares in limited\nliability companies or corporations. Sometimes workers are able to scrape\nenough capital together to purchase a firm that would otherwise be going out\nof business. The rationale behind these situations is that a worker who\nidentifies financially with a company will work harder for its success.\nImportant variables are the form of participation (return on investment rights\nor control rights), its degree (amount and timing of returns) and the reasons\nbehind financial participation. In any event, these practices are largely\nreserved to Europe and North America. If cooperative ventures are considered\npart of this phenomenon, however, the notion of workers being stakeholders in\ntheir work is much more widespread throughout the world. It would be\ninteresting to study whether and to what extent employee ownership of a firm\nor of shares in it has an effect on the workplace safety and health record.\n\n### Health and Safety Committees and Representatives\n\nA specialized form of workers\u2019 participation is seen in the development of\nhealth and safety committees and health and safety representatives (for worker\nparticipation in Denmark, see Box). The legislation of a number of countries\nprovides for the establishment of such committees and for such representatives\n(e.g., Belgium, several provinces of Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,\nSweden). Smaller companies, variously defined, are usually excluded from such\nmandatory measures, but they, like larger units, often set up health and\nsafety committees on their own initiative. In addition, many collective\nbargaining agreements have led to the creation of such committees and to the\ndesignation of health and safety representatives (e.g., in Canada and the\nUnited States).\n\n#### Denmark: Worker Participation in Health and Safety\n\nDanish industrial relations provide an example of a country with a number of\ninstitutions that play a role in relation to health and safety. The main\nfeatures are:\n\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING: Negotiation of agreements by which trade unions and\nemployers fix wages, conditions of work, etc. Pertinent highlights are:\n\nShop stewards who are elected by workers under collective bargaining\nagreements; enjoy statutory protection against dismissal; serve as channel\nbetween workers and management on working conditions.\n\nCollective Agreement on Cooperation and Cooperation Committees provides for\ninformation to be given to individuals and groups of workers in advance so\nthey can make their views known before a decision is taken and for the\nestablishment of cooperation committees.\n\nCooperation committees must be set up in all firms employing more than 35\nworkers (25 in the public service). Joint committees to promote cooperation in\nday-to-day operations; they must be consulted on the introduction of new\ntechnologies and the organization of production; some co-determination rights\non working conditions, training and personal data.\n\nNational collective agreement on industrial disputes (of 1910) gives workers a\nright (rarely exercised) to stop work if considerations of \u201clife, welfare or\nhonour\u201d make this absolutely necessary. Other collective agreements contain\nprovisions on training and trade unions also provide it.\n\nFRAMEWORK LAW: The Working Environment Act creates \u201cthe basis on which the\nundertakings themselves will be able to solve questions relating to safety and\nhealth under the guidance of the employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and\nunder the guidance and supervision of the Labour Inspection Service\u201d (Sec.\n1(b)). The Act establishes a complete system from the plant to the national\nlevel to permit worker participation:\n\nSafety representatives are elected representatives required in firms employing\nat least ten workers; they enjoy the same protection against dismissal and\nretaliation as shop stewards and are entitled to reimbursement of official\nexpenses.\n\nSafety groups: The safety representative and the department supervisor form\nthe safety group. Its functions are to:\n\n\u00b7 monitor working conditions\n\n\u00b7 inspect equipment, tools, materials\n\n\u00b7 report any risk which cannot be avoided immediately\n\n\u00b7 halt production where necessary to avert an imminent serious danger\n\n\u00b7 ensure that work is performed safely and proper instructions are given\n\n\u00b7 investigate industrial accidents and occupational diseases\n\n\u00b7 participate in prevention activities\n\n\u00b7 cooperate with the occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 act as link between workers and the safety committee.\n\nMembers of the safety group are entitled to training and to necessary\ninformation.\n\nSafety Committees are required in firms employing at least 20 workers. In\nfirms with more than two safety groups, the safety committees consist of\nworkers elected from among safety representatives, two supervisor members and\nan employer\u2019s representative.\n\nThe functions are:\n\n\u00b7 planning, directing and coordinating health and safety activities\n\n\u00b7 being consulted on these matters\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with other companies engaged in work at the same workplace\n\n\u00b7 cooperating with the company\u2019s occupational health service\n\n\u00b7 supervising the activity of safety groups\n\n\u00b7 making recommendations on prevention of accidents and diseases.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL involves employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations in\nthe definition and application of preventive policy at the national level.\nComposition: 11 representatives of employee organizations representing manual\nand non-manual workers, one for supervisors, ten of employers\u2019 organizations,\nplus an occupational medical practitioner, a technical expert and non-voting\ngovernmental representatives. Functions:\n\n\u00b7 is consulted on drafting legislation and regulations\n\n\u00b7 may on its own initiative take up a health and safety matter\n\n\u00b7 submits annual recommendations on working environment policy\n\n\u00b7 coordinates the activities of Trade Safety Councils\n\n\u00b7 supervises the activity of the Working Environment Fund.\n\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT FUND is managed by a tripartite board. The Fund has mainly\ninformation and training duties, but also finances research programmes.\n\nTRADE SAFETY COUNCILS: Twelve Trade Safety Councils examine the problems of\ntheir trade or industry and advise undertakings. They are also consulted on\ndraft legislation. Equal representation of employers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019\norganizations on the one hand and workers\u2019 organizations on the other hand.\n\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES: In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Labour\nInspection Service and within it, the Danish Institute of the Working\nEnvironment, provide various types of services and advice in the field of\noccupational safety and health. Collective industrial disputes are heard by\nthe Labour Courts.\n\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Vogel 1994).  \n  \n---  \n  \nOften, collective bargaining agreements will strengthen the legislatively\nguaranteed powers afforded to workers\u2019 safety and health representatives. The\ncommittees and representatives vary in regard to their relationship to trade\nunions and works councils, their election or appointment, their duties and\nfunctions and their impact. As a form of workers\u2019 involvement in the\nspecialized sphere of health and safety, such committees and representatives\ncan be a contributing factor to improving both working conditions and the\nlabour relations climate. They have been most successful when they form an\nintegral part of management\u2019s safety and health programme, have access to\nadequate information, involve rank-and-file workers in their activities to\nhelp ensure continuity and are backed up by effective government labour\ninspection. Where employers maintain occupational health services or have\nsafety experts, a fruitful relationship with them can also promote the success\nof joint health and safety committees. A recent workplace survey in the United\nKingdom, for instance, found that \u201cjoint consultative committees, with all\nemployee representatives appointed by unions, significantly reduced workplace\ninjuries relative to those establishments where the management alone\ndetermines health and safety arrangements\u201d (Reilly, Paci and Holl 1995). They\nalso reported an important role for joint consultative committees where\nemployee representatives were appointed in other ways. However, some research\nalso indicates that joint health and safety committees fall short of the\nexpectations held out for them. The reasons suggested for this differ:\ninsufficient support from management, participants who are not adequately\ninformed or trained, workers not represented forcefully enough and so on.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives may be appointed by management (as\nin many workplaces where no trade union is present), designated by the trade\nunion (as in the United Kingdom) or elected directly by the workers at the\nenterprise or higher level (as in Denmark). A parallel system will be used for\nworker representatives on a joint labour-management health and safety\ncommittee which, while bipartite, will not always have equal representation\nfrom both sides. General institutions for workers\u2019 representation are often\ncomplemented by special representative structures for health and safety (as in\nSpain).\n\nThe mechanism chosen will often reflect the existence of other labour\nrelations institutions in a country: in France, for instance, employee members\nof the joint health, safety and working conditions committees are appointed by\na delegate elected from the works committee and staff representatives; in\nGermany, members designated by the works council will be among those serving\non a joint health and safety committee. Works councils in the Netherlands may\ndelegate their powers to a safety, health and welfare committee. A strong\nlink, if not identity, between trade union representatives and health and\nsafety representatives is usually seen as desirable (as in Quebec (Canada),\nIreland, Norway and Sweden), but where trade union density is low this runs\nthe risk of depriving large numbers of workers of representation rights in\nrelation to health and safety. Speculation that joint health and safety\ncommittees might lead to extending greater workers\u2019 participation to other\nfields has remained largely unfounded.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives normally have the following rights:\nto have access to information on health and safety and the introduction of new\ntechnology, to be consulted on these matters, to be involved in monitoring\nworkplace conditions, to accompany inspectors (sometimes called the\n\u201cwalkaround right\u201d), to be involved in accident investigations and to make\nrecommendations to management on the improvement of working conditions. In\nsome countries their powers go beyond this to include the right to engage in\nco-decision making, to initiate inspections and accident investigations and to\nreview management\u2019s reports to government. Most importantly, some workers\u2019\nhealth and safety representatives are empowered to order the shut-down of an\nimminently hazardous operation (also called \u201cred-tagging\u201d, for the marker\nplaced on the spot), as in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. They are in\ncertain instances, such as in France and some provinces of Canada, directly\ninvolved in the enforcement of health and safety regulations. Prior\nconsultation of the joint committee is sometimes necessary before an employer\ncan make any significant change in health, safety or working conditions (as in\nFrance and the Netherlands). In Belgium intercompany health services are under\nthe control of a joint committee. In Italy the committees\u2019 role includes the\npromotion of prevention, and in Greece they can, with the employers\u2019\nagreement, call for expert opinions on health and safety questions.\n\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives necessarily enjoy protection from\ndiscrimination or retaliation in the exercise of their functions. They are\nentitled to at least some time off with pay, as well as to have the necessary\nmeans (the definition of which is often debated) to exercise their functions.\nIn addition, while in office some are specially shielded from economic layoffs\n(redundancies) or given extra protection from dismissal (as in Belgium).\nFrequently, worker health and safety representatives have a right to receive\nspecialized training (as in Denmark).\n\nThe effect that workers\u2019 health and safety representatives and joint\ncommittees can have will of course depend not only on rights and duties set\nout in legislation or in a collective bargaining agreement, but on how they\nare exercised in practice. This is in turn influenced by factors that affect\nworkers\u2019 participation generally. Such representatives and joint committees\nare no substitute for the effective government enforcement of health and\nsafety standards or for what may be achieved by means of collective\nbargaining. However, \u201cmost observers believe that (mandated joint health and\nsafety) committees provide a more efficient regulatory regime for safety and\nhealth than inspectorate or civil liability schemes\u201d (Kaufman and Kleiner\n1993). In any event, the trend is definitely towards greater workers\u2019\nparticipation in health and safety matters, at least in terms of collective\nagreements covering larger enterprises and legislation. Where they operate as\neffective institutions, joint health and safety committees can be a valuable\ntool for identifying problems and raising awareness of hazards, thus\npotentially reducing the incidence of injury, disease and death on the job.\nThe extent to which they are effective, however, depends on a large range of\nvariables in the particular labour relations system and in the strategic\napproach taken to health and safety at the workplace.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nSchregle (1994) has commented:\n\nIn practice, none of these workers\u2019 participation schemes has produced the\nexpected results. There are many reasons for this. One is that, in a general\nway, trade unions and employers do not have the same view of participation.\nWhile it is the workers\u2019 desire to exert a tangible and concrete influence on\nemployers\u2019 decisions in the sense of power-sharing, employers insist on\nmanagement rights or management prerogatives, derived from private ownership,\nto run the business according to their own criteria and decision-making power,\naffording to workers at most the right to express their views and positions\nwithout binding effect on management. The result of all this is confusion over\nsuch terms as consultation, workers\u2019 participation, workers\u2019 participation in\nmanagement, co-determination, co-management, etc.\n\nThe fact remains that in most workplaces around the world, there is little\neffective employee participation at the enterprise level. The first level of\nparticipation and indeed a prerequisite for it, is the provision of\ninformation, followed by consultation. Within Europe, research has indicated a\nwide variation in the extent of implementation of the 1989 framework directive\non health and safety, when it comes to workers\u2019 participation; it may get a\nnew lease on life with the impetus of the 1995 directive on European works\ncouncils. A high degree of non-participation also characterizes other regions.\nNevertheless, high hopes continue to be held out for strengthening mechanisms\nfor workers\u2019 participation at the enterprise level.\n\nThe traditional approach to workers\u2019 participation as promotional of greater\nworker-management cooperation falls short of being satisfactory in relation to\nhealth and safety issues, where the categorization of labour relations as\nconflictual or cooperative does not particularly advance the debate. As Vogel\n(1994) notes:\n\n...the problem of worker participation is clearly not confined to the\ninstitutionalized forms of participation in or outside the undertaking. The\nbasis of participation lies in the recognition that distinct interests are in\nplay giving rise to specific rationales... The essential legitimacy of\nparticipation is to be found outside the firm in a democratic requirement\nwhich refuses to admit that the self-determination of individuals should be\nconfined within the rules of political representation and in a view of health\nconceived as a purposeful, social process through which individuals and\ncommunities develop strategies for self-fulfilment and defence.\n\nIn the end, the differing functions of various workers\u2019 participation schemes\nmake it difficult to assess their comparative impact. As collective bargaining\nshrinks in coverage, however, greater use of management-led workers\u2019\nparticipation arrangements may be expected.\n\n## CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nMarco Biagi\n\n### Worker Participation in Health and Safety Matters\n\nWorker participation in safety organization in plants can be planned in many\nways, depending on national law and practice. This article refers only to\nconsultation and information arrangements, not related forms of employee\ninvolvement. Additional coverage of specific aspects somewhat linked with\nconsultation and information (e.g., participation in or initiation of\ninspections, participation in training activities) is offered elsewhere in\nthis chapter.\n\nThe idea of employers and employees working jointly to improve health and\nsafety at work is based on several principles:\n\n1\\. Workers can contribute to prevention of industrial accidents by spotting\nand warning about potential hazards and giving notice of imminent dangers.\n\n2\\. Involving employees educates and motivates them to cooperate in the\npromotion of safety.\n\n3\\. Ideas and experiences of workers are regarded as a useful contribution to\nsafety improvement.\n\n4\\. People have a right to be involved in decisions that affect their working\nlife, particularly their health and well-being.\n\n5\\. Cooperation between the two sides of industry, essential to improve\nworking conditions, should be based on an equal partnership.\n\nThese principles have been laid down in the ILO Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155). Article 20 provides that \u201cco-operation between\nmanagement and workers and/or their representatives within the undertaking\nshall be an essential element of organizational and other measures\u201d in the\narea of occupational health and safety. Also the ILO Communications within the\nUndertaking Recommendation, 1967 (No. 129), Paragraph 2(1), underlines that:\n\n...employers and their organizations as well as workers and their\norganizations should, in their common interest, recognise the importance of a\nclimate of mutual understanding and confidence within undertakings that is\nfavourable both to the efficiency of the undertaking and to the aspirations of\nthe workers.\n\nThe underlying philosophy is that employers and employees have a common\ninterest in a self-regulating system in industrial accident prevention;\nactually they are more interested in occupational safety than in occupational\nhealth, since the occupational origin of accidents is more simple to establish\nand they are thus compensated more easily. Also for this reason safety\nrepresentatives in many countries were historically the first employee\nrepresentatives at the workplace to have their rights and duties determined by\nlaw or collective agreements. Today there is probably no subject in labour\nrelations and human resources management on which the social partners are so\nready to collaborate as in health and safety matters. But in some national\ncontexts trade unions have not put sufficient resources into the safety and\nhealth effort to make it a major issue in either negotiations or contract\nadministration.\n\n### Information and Consultation Rights in Legislation in ILO and European\nUnion.\n\nThe general obligation for employers to disclose information in health and\nsafety matters to workers and/or their representatives and seek their opinion\nvia consultative arrangements is provided by Article 20 of the ILO Prevention\nof Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174). This norm prescribes\nthat \u201cthe workers and their representatives at a major hazard installation\nshall be consulted through appropriate cooperative mechanisms in order to\nensure a safe system of work\u201d. More specifically workers and their\nrepresentatives have the right to:\n\n(a) be adequately and suitably informed of the hazards associated with the\nmajor hazard installation and their likely consequences; (b) be informed of\nany orders, instructions or recommendations made by the competent authority;\n(c) be consulted in the preparation of and have access to, the following\ndocuments: (i) safety reports, (ii) emergency plans and procedures, (iii)\naccident reports.\n\nAs a consequence of these information and consultation rights, workers are\nentitled \u201cto discuss with the employer any potential hazards they consider\ncapable of generating a major accident\u201d (Article 20(f)).\n\nMore generally ILO Convention No. 155 lays down rules concerning occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment, providing for effective\narrangements at the level of the undertaking (be they regulated by law or\ncollective bargaining or even left to local/domestic practices) under which\n\u201c(c) representatives of workers... are given adequate information on measures\ntaken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and may consult\ntheir representative organizations about such information provided they do not\ndisclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article 19). The same norm adds that under these\narrangements workers or their representatives must be \u201cenabled to enquire into\nand are consulted by the employer, on all aspects of occupational safety and\nhealth associated with their work\u201d. And for this purpose \u201ctechnical advisers\nmay, by mutual agreement, be brought in from outside the undertaking\u201d.\n\nILO Recommendation No. 164 supplementing Convention No. 155 (Paragraph 12)\nclarifies that information and consultation rights on safety and health\nmatters should be granted to a variety of participatory institutions: workers\u2019\nsafety delegates, workers\u2019 safety and health committees, joint safety and\nhealth committees and other workers\u2019 representatives. This text also states\nimportant principles affecting the nature and the content of\ninformation/consultation. These practices should first of all enable the\nabove-mentioned specialized forms of workers\u2019 representation \u201cto contribute in\nthe decision-making process at the level of the undertaking regarding matters\nof safety and health\u201d (Article 12(e)).\n\nThese are not simply rights to know and to be heard: workers and their\nrepresentatives should \u201c(a) be given adequate information on safety and health\nmatters, enabled to examine factors affecting safety and health and encouraged\nto propose measures on the subject\u201d. They should also \u201c(b) be consulted when\nmajor new safety and health measures are envisaged and before they are carried\nout and seek to obtain the support of the workers for such measures\u201d and\n\u201c(c)... in planning alterations to work processes, work content or\norganization of work, which may have safety or health implications for the\nworkers\u201d.\n\nThe principle under which \u201crepresentatives of the workers... should be\ninformed and consulted in advance by the employer on projects, measures and\ndecisions which are liable to have harmful consequences on the health of\nworkers\u201d (ILO Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration)\nRecommendation, 1977 (No. 156), Paragraph 21) reflects the idea of an\n\u201ceffective policy of communication\u201d stated in general terms by Paragraph 3 of\nILO Recommendation No. 129, which prescribes that \u201cinformation is given and\nthat consultation takes place between the parties concerned before decisions\non matters of major interest are taken by management\u201d. And in order to make\nthese practices effective, \u201csteps should be taken to train those concerned in\nthe use of communications methods\u201d (Para. 6).\n\nThe participative approach in labour relations in the area of health and\nsafety is confirmed by other international legal texts. A meaningful example\nin this respect is offered by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the\nintroduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of\npeople working in countries of the European Union. Article 10 provides for the\nemployer an obligation to take appropriate measures so that workers and/or\ntheir representatives receive, in accordance with national law and/or\npractices, all necessary information\u201d concerning safety and health risks,\nprotective and preventive measures (also for first aid, fire-fighting and\nevacuation of workers and in case of serious and imminent danger). This\ninformation has to be \u201cprovided in a suitable form to temporary workers and\nhired workers present in the establishment or enterprise\u201d. Additionally\n\u201cworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of\nworkers, or workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the\nsafety and health of workers\u201d must have access to risk assessment and\nprotective measures, reports on occupational accidents and illnesses suffered\nby workers and all information yielded by protective and preventive measures,\ninspection agencies and bodies responsible for safety and health.\n\nArticle 11 of the EC Directive links consultation and participation. In fact\nemployers are under the obligation to \u201cconsult workers and/or their\nrepresentatives and allow them to take part in discussions on all questions\nrelating to safety and health at work\u201d. That presupposes \u201cthe consultation of\nworkers, the right of workers and/or their representatives to make proposals\n(and) balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or\npractices\u201d. The document continues, prescribing that:\n\nworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of workers\nor workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the safety and\nhealth of workers shall participate in a balanced way, in accordance with\nnational laws and/or practices, or be consulted in advance and in due time by\nthe employer...\n\nThe objective of these rights is to cover all measures which may substantially\naffect health and safety, including the designation of employees required to\nimplement certain measures (first-aid, fire-fighting and evacuation of\nworkers) and the planning and organization of adequate health and safety\ntraining throughout the employment relationship (upon hiring, job transfer,\nintroduction of new working equipment, introduction of any new technology).\n\nThe choice is clear: no to conflict, yes to participation in health and safety\nlabour relations. This is the meaning of the EC Framework Directive, which\ngoes beyond the simple logic of the right to information. The system is based\non a genuine form of consultation, since it must take place \u201cin advance and in\ngood time\u201d \u2013 in other words, not only prior to decisions being adopted by the\nemployer but also soon enough for proposals and comments to be made about\nthem.\n\nThe Directive also uses the ambiguous expression \u201cbalanced participation\u201d, a\nformula open to various interpretations. The notion is broader than (or, at\nleast, different from) that of consultation, but not to the extent of\nconstituting a form of joint decision making, which would prevent employers\nfrom taking measures which had not been approved by the workers or their\nrepresentatives. It seems quite clearly to be a form of participation going\nbeyond mere consultation (otherwise the article heading \u201cconsultation and\nparticipation\u201d would be nonsense) but not necessarily as far as joint decision\nmaking. The concept is left somewhat vague: it embraces a range of multiple\nforms of worker participation which vary considerably between Member States of\nthe European Union. And in any case the Directive does not place any\nobligation to provide a specific form of balanced participation.\n\nIn both the ILO and EC texts, information seems to be a concept whereby\nmanagement informs the employees\u2019 representatives body in writing or in a\nmeeting. Consultation means that normally joint committees are set up in which\nemployees\u2019 representatives are not merely informed by management, but can also\ncomment and expect justification from management in the event of differing\nopinions. Certainly these concepts differ from negotiation (when a\ncontractually binding outcome is worked out in joint negotiating committees at\ncompany or inter-company level) and co-determination (where the employee has a\nright of veto and decisions require the agreement of both parties).\n\nFor Community-scale undertakings and groups thereof, EU Council Directive No.\n94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 requires setting up European Works Council or an\ninformation and consultation procedure. The information relates \u201cin particular\nto transnational questions which significantly affect workers\u2019 interests\u201d\n(Article 6(3)). Time will tell if this is used for safety and health purposes.\n\n### Role of Workers\u2019 Representatives in Risk Assessment and Improvement of\nWork Environment: Record-keeping\n\nThe active nature of consultation is also stressed in Article 11(3) of the EC\nFramework Directive, which states that either workers with specific functions\nin this area or workers\u2019 representatives in general \u201cmay call on the employer\nto take appropriate measures and submit to him relevant proposals by means of\nwhich all risks to workers may be reduced and/or sources of danger\neliminated\u201d.\n\nThe Framework Directive, with its provisions on risk management, while placing\nclear responsibilities on employers, also favours the greater involvement of\nworkers and their representatives in consultations on management strategies in\nhealth and safety. Employers must assess risks and present their risk-control\nmanagement systems in a plan or statement. In all cases they are expected to\nconsult with and involve workers and/or their representatives in all the\ndesign, implementation and monitoring of these systems. But it is undeniable\nthat this Directive, by conferring relevant participative rights to workers,\nhas at the same time adopted an approach of \u201cself-assessment\u201d. Other EC\nDirectives require, among other things, the recording of the results of\nmeasurements and examinations and lay down the employees\u2019 rights of access to\nthese records.\n\nAlso ILO Recommendation No. 164 (Para. 15(2)) provides that:\n\n...employers should be required to keep such records relevant to occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment as are considered necessary by\nthe competent authority or authorities; these might include records of all\nnotifiable occupational accidents and injuries to health which arise in the\ncourse of or in connection with work, records of authorisation and exemptions\nunder laws or regulations in the field and any conditions to which they may be\nsubject, certificates relating to supervision of the health of workers in the\nundertaking and data concerning exposure to specified substances and agents.\n\nIt is a general principle worldwide that employers are required to keep\nrecords, for instance of accidents and occupational diseases, or on the use or\npresence of biological and environmental monitoring.\n\n### National Laws and Practices\n\nBy comparison, labour relations systems exist (e.g., Italy) where statutory\nlaw provides no specific right to information and consultation in occupational\nsafety and health for workers\u2019 representatives, although such a right is often\nincluded in collective agreements. Italian legislation gives the workers\nthemselves the right to control the implementation of standards relating to\nthe prevention of accidents and occupational diseases, as well as the right to\ndevelop studies and adopt adequate measures in order to safeguard health and\nsafety at work. In other systems (e.g., in the United Kingdom) in order to\nobtain disclosure of information on matters of health and safety as provided\nby law, it is necessary first to have safety representatives appointed; but\nthis is possible only if there is a recognized trade union in existence at the\nundertaking. In situations where the employer refuses or withdraws the\nnecessary status of a recognized trade union, information and consultation\nrights cannot be exercised.\n\nThese national experiences raise the question: To what extent is effective\nworkers\u2019 participation in health and safety conditional on the adoption of\nstatutory arrangements? Certainly some legal backing seems to be helpful, the\noptimum amount of legislation being probably at a point where it provides for\nthe election of workers\u2019 representatives with sufficiently strong rights to\nallow them to function independently of management, while at the same time\nleaving room for a certain variety in the organizational arrangements for\nparticipation in different sectors and corporations.\n\nIn general labour relations systems provide by law that workers\u2019\nrepresentatives are to be informed and consulted in health and safety matters.\nWhen joint committees composed of management and employee representatives are\nestablished, they enjoy considerable powers. For instance in France the\ncommittee for health, safety and working conditions may propose preventive\nmeasures: an employer declining to accept them must give detailed reasons. But\nempirical evidence demonstrates that sometimes safety representatives seem\nmore efficient than joint committees since they are less dependent on the\nexistence of a cooperative relationship.\n\nThrough various forms of representational participation, employees in general\nenjoy rights recognized by ILO Conventions and Recommendations (plus EC\ndirectives, when applicable) mentioned earlier with special reference to\nindustrialized free-market economies. Safety representatives and/or works\ncouncillors have a right to be informed and consulted by the employer on all\nissues relating to the company\u2019s operations and the improvement of working\nconditions, including health and safety matters. They have the right to see\nall relevant documents that the employer is statutorily obliged to keep and\nalso to see any statements on the subject and the results of any research.\nThey may also have copies of any of these documents if required.\n\n### Effectiveness of Information and Consultation Rights\n\nApart from specific aspects (such as use of experts, participation in or\ninitiation of inspections, protection from victimization) which strongly\naffect the effectiveness of information and consultation rights in health and\nsafety, there are general factors which have to be taken into account in this\nrespect. First, the size of the undertaking: the effectiveness of controls is\non the wane in small units, where trade unions and other forms of workers\u2019\nrepresentation are almost absent. Small-sized establishments are also least\nlikely to implement statutory requirements.\n\nSecondly, where safety representatives are integrated into the formal trade\nunion organization at the workplace, they are more likely to achieve the\nexpected improvements in the working environment. Thirdly, consultation and\ninformation arrangements in health and safety reflect the more conflictual\n(e.g., UK, Italy) or cooperative (e.g., Germany, Scandinavian countries,\nJapan) nature of the surrounding labour relations system. And in general,\ncollaboration between management and labour favours the disclosing of\ninformation and consultation.\n\nFourthly, the role of managerial initiative should not be underestimated. More\nthan the existence of statutory rights, consultation and information are\neffective when there is the presence of a managerial culture which supports\nthem. Employers\u2014by their attitude towards training, their commitment to\ndisclosing information and their speed in answering queries\u2014are able to create\nan adversarial or cooperative climate. Legal backing is essential to guarantee\nfull independence to worker representatives to act in this field, but then the\nsuccess of information/consultation arrangements depends largely on the\nvoluntary choice of both sides of industry.\n\nLastly it must be said that a precondition for successful worker\nrepresentation in health and safety at the workplace is public awareness. It\nis fundamental for this specialized form of employee involvement that such a\nneed is perceived and valued by people at work. There is empirical evidence\nthat workers identify health and safety as one of the most significant\nconcerns in their working life.\n\n### Safeguards on Use of Information\n\nComparative experience demonstrates that in general safety representatives are\nconsidered to be in breach of confidence if they reveal any information\nrelating to an employer\u2019s production processes and other professional secrets.\nFurthermore, they are obliged to use discretion with regard to any information\nprovided to them which the employer indicates is confidential. ILO Convention\nNo. 155 recognizes this by providing that enterprise-level representatives may\nconsult their representative organizations about occupational health and\nsafety information \u201cprovided they do not disclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article\n19(c)).\n\nIn some systems (e.g., Greece) employee representatives on works councils are\nobliged not to communicate to third parties information acquired which is of\nfundamental importance to the enterprise and which, if disclosed, would harm\nthe enterprise\u2019s competitiveness. The employee representatives and the\nemployer are supposed to decide jointly what information can be disclosed.\nUnder other systems (e.g., Luxembourg), where if employee representatives\ndisagree with an employer\u2019s classification of information as confidential,\nthey may refer the matter to the inspectorate for a decision.\n\nIn some countries the duty of confidentiality is only implicit (e.g., Italy).\nAlso when there is no specific requirement in this respect (e.g., United\nKingdom), employee representatives cannot receive from the employer\ninformation relating to the health of individuals (unless their consent is\ngiven), information that would damage national security or information that\nwould damage the employer\u2019s undertaking. Finally (e.g., Sweden) the duty to\nobserve confidentiality may not prevent safety representatives from passing on\nthe information received to the executive board of their trade union, which\nwill also be bound to observe confidentiality.\n\n## LABOUR RELATIONS ASPECTS OF TRAINING\nOther examples of collaborative organizations in this field can be found in\nCanada. At the federal level, the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and\nSafety is Canada\u2019s main resource for information on this topic. The Centre\nalso promotes health and safety in the workplace, facilitates the\nestablishment of high standards of occupational health and safety and assists\nin the development of programmes and policies to reduce or eliminate\noccupational hazards. The Centre, created by an act of parliament in 1978, was\ngiven a tripartite governing body to ensure its impartiality in occupational\nhealth and safety matters, including being an unbiased source of information.\nIts governing council consists of a chairperson and 12 governors \u2013 four\nrepresenting the federal, provincial and territorial governments; four\nrepresenting labour; and four representing employers. The Centre manages\nsignificant human and financial resources and its total expenditures in 1993\nwere approximately C$8.3 million.\nIn some provinces there are also collaborative organizations. In Quebec, two\nprominent organizations are the Commission for Occupational Health and Safety\nand the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research. The Commission\nhas two functions. The first is to develop and implement occupational health\nand safety policy, including the establishment of standards and their\nenforcement; the provision of support for the implementation of prevention\nprogrammes, participation mechanisms and health services; and the provision of\ntraining, information and research services. The second is to provide payment\nto workers injured on the job and to manage an insurance fund for this purpose\nto which employers must contribute. The Commission, which was established by\nlaw in 1981 and which succeeded the Commission of Occupational Accidents\nfounded in 1931, has a bipartite board of directors which is composed of seven\nworkers\u2019 representatives, seven representatives of employers and a\nchairperson. The representatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations are\nchosen from lists supplied by the most representative labour and employer\norganizations. The Commission manages large human and financial resources and\nat the end of 1992 had expenditures of C$2,151.7 million and employed 3,013\npersons as permanent staff and 652 as casual employees.\nQuebec\u2019s Institute of Occupational Health and Safety Research, founded in\n1980, has as its mandate to contribute, through scientific research, to the\nidentification and the elimination of sources of workplace hazards, as well as\nto the readaptation of workers who have suffered workplace injuries. The board\nof directors of the Institute is the same as that of the Commission for\nOccupational Health and Safety, notwithstanding that it is an independent\ninstitution. The Institute also has a scientific council which has advisory\nfunctions and is composed of four representatives of workers\u2019 organizations,\nfour from employers\u2019 organizations, six representatives of the scientific and\ntechnical community and the Institute\u2019s Director General. In 1992, the\nInstitute had expenditures of C$17.9 million and approximately 126 employees.\nThe Ontario Workplace Health and Safety Agency, established in 1990 by\namendment of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, also has responsibility\nfor developing and implementing policy and for managing occupational health\nand safety programmes in Ontario. The governing body of the organization\nconsists of a bipartite board of 18 persons with nine representatives each\nfrom workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations. Of these representatives, one\nrepresentative of labour and one of management serve as joint chief executive\nofficers. The resources of this organization are substantial \u2013 total\nexpenditures amounted to C$64.9 million in 1992.\nOne country with a long tradition of collaborative organizations in the field\nof occupational safety and health, Sweden, decided to reject this form of\norganization in 1992 and has subsequently used advisory organizations instead.\nIt should be added that this decision was not confined to occupational safety\nand health, but included all collaborative organizations of any kind in which\nrepresentatives of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organizations played a decision-\nmaking role at the national level. The impetus for this change came from the\nprincipal employers\u2019 organization, which decided unilaterally to withdraw from\nparticipation in collaborative public institutions. The central employers\u2019\norganization argued that interest groups should not have political\nresponsibility in terms of managing public institutions, but that the\ngovernment and parliament should have this political role and responsibility;\nthat the role of the employers\u2019 organization was to represent its members\u2019\ninterests, and that this role could be in conflict with a duty to serve the\ninterests of the public institutions if the employers\u2019 organization was\nrepresented on the governing boards of such institutions; and that\nparticipation weakened democracy and the development of public institutions.\nAlthough workers\u2019 organizations were not in agreement with the employers\u2019\norganizations on these points, the government concluded that collaborative\nbodies with no representation from the principal employers\u2019 organization were\nimpractical and decided to have representation by workers\u2019 and employers\u2019\norganizations as well as other interest groups only on advisory bodies. Hence,\norganizations in the field of occupational safety and health such as the\nNational Board of Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of\nOccupational Health and the Working Life Fund, which had formerly been\ncollaborative in character in terms of a tripartite or multipartite governing\nboard, were restructured.\nAlthough collaborative organizations in most countries are more rare than\nadvisory organizations, which are quite widespread, the case of Sweden\u2019s\nrejection of collaborative institutions, at least in the field of occupational\nsafety and health, appears to be an isolated one. Although some collaborative\ninstitutions, dealing notably with questions of economic policy, training and\nemployment, were dismantled in Great Britain during the 1980s and 1990s by\nsuccessive conservative governments, the Health and Safety Commission was not\naffected. Some have advanced that this is because occupational safety and\nhealth is a subject of common concern to employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations\nas well as the government and other interested parties and therefore there is\na strong interest by all parties in finding a consensus in both policy\nformulation and implementation. Also, in Canada such collaborative\ninstitutions have been created at both the federal level and in some provinces\nprecisely because a collaborative approach was deemed more useful in finding a\nconsensus between the labour market parties and because administration of the\noccupational safety and health laws would appear more impartial and fair to\nthose affected by them.\nOn a broader level, however, there are two national consultative bodies which\nare also concerned with occupational safety and health issues as part of their\nmore general mandate to address all important social and economic questions of\nnational importance. In the Netherlands, the Labour Foundation, established in\nMay 1945, is a bipartite organization jointly managed by equal numbers of\nrepresentatives from central employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations (including\nfarmers) and has a significant role as an advisory body to the Government.\nAlthough historically its main function has concerned questions of wage\npolicy, it also expresses its views on other conditions of work. The other\nnational consultative body of importance is the Social and Economic Council,\nwhich was founded in 1950 pursuant to the Act on Statutory Trade Associations.\nThe tripartite Council consists of 15 representatives of central employers\u2019\norganizations, 15 representatives of central workers\u2019 organizations and 15\nindependent experts. The employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 representatives are appointed\nby their organizations and the independent experts are appointed by the Crown.\nIn making its appointments, the Crown also tries to have a balance between the\nmajor political parties. The Council is independent of the government and is\nfinanced by a mandatory tax on employers.\nThe Council has a multimillion dollar budget and its own Secretariat. The\nCouncil normally meets once a month and is assisted by a number of permanent\nand ad hoc committees, which are frequently also constituted on a tripartite\nbasis. The government is required by law to submit all proposals for social\nand economic legislation to the Council for its advice and any labour\nlegislation \u2013 which would include proposals concerning occupational safety and\nhealth \u2013 comes before the Council.\nIt should be added that a number of countries require that workplace health\nand safety committees should or may be established for enterprises which have\nmore than a certain number of employees. These committees are bipartite in\nnature and include representatives of the employers and the workers. These\ncommittees normally have as their function to investigate and propose all ways\nand means of actively contributing to measures undertaken to ensure the best\npossible health and safety conditions in the establishment, a role which can\ninclude the promotion and monitoring of health and safety conditions in the\nenterprise to ensure, among other things, adherence to applicable law and\nregulations. These joint committees are normally advisory in character.\nWorkplace health and safety committees, for example, are legally required in\nBelgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain.\nMuneto Ozaki and Anne Trebilcock\nThe phrase workers\u2019 participation is used loosely to encompass various forms\nof workers\u2019 participation in decision making, usually at the enterprise level.\nThey complement other forms that may exist at the industrial or sectoral level\nand the national level, such as bodies for tripartite cooperation. The types\nof workers\u2019 participation arrangement differ widely with regard to their\nfunctions and powers, ranging from informal individual employee suggestion\nschemes to co-determination of certain matters by workers\u2019 representatives\ntogether with management. The mechanisms used for encouraging employee\nparticipation vary so widely that it is impossible to review them fully here.\nThe main forms that have attracted recent interest, particularly in the field\nof work organization, are reviewed below; to these could be added the\nhistorical example of self-management by workers in former Yugoslavia. As\nparticularly relevant today, joint safety and health committees are examined\nas a special form of workers\u2019 participation within the larger labour relations\ncontext.\nThe idea of workers\u2019 participation arose in Europe, where collective\nbargaining has usually been at the branch or industry level; this often left a\ngap of employee representation at the enterprise or plant level, which became\nfilled by bodies such as works councils, works committees, enterprise\ncommittees and so forth. Many developing countries have also adopted\nlegislative initiatives with a view to having works councils or similar\nstructures set up (e.g., Pakistan, Thailand, Zimbabwe) as a means of promoting\nlabour-management cooperation. The relationship of these bodies to trade\nunions and collective bargaining has been the subject of considerable\nlegislation and negotiation. This is reflected in a provision of the ILO\nWorkers\u2019 Representatives Convention, 1971 (No. 135), which states that where\nboth trade union representatives and elected representatives exist in the same\nundertaking, measures shall be taken to ensure that the existence of those\nrepresentatives is not used to undermine the position of the trade union\n(Article 5).\nWorkers may participate in decision making either directly themselves or\nindirectly through their representatives \u2013 trade unions or elected employee\nrepresentatives. Since the 1980s, there has been a spread of direct\nparticipation by workers, if the term participation is understood as the\nexercise of any influence on their work or how it is to be carried out. Thus\nworkers may \u201cparticipate\u201d in work-related decisions not only when there is an\ninstitution, such as a quality circle, at the workplace. Accordingly, a simple\nexercise of work enrichment may be a form of promoting direct participation of\nworkers.\nDirect participation may be on an individual basis \u2013 for example, through\nsuggestion schemes or \u201cenriched\u201d work. It may also be on a group basis \u2013 for\nexample, in quality circles or similar small-group activities. Teamwork in\nitself constitutes a form of group-based direct participation. Direct\nparticipation may be integrated into decisions about daily work, or it may\ntake place outside daily work, such as in a voluntary quality circle that cuts\nacross the group structure habitually used. Direct participation may also be\n\u201cconsultative\u201d or \u201cdeliberative\u201d; research by the European Foundation for the\nImprovement of Living and Working Conditions has explored this particular\naspect in some detail (Regalia and Gill 1996). With consultative\nparticipation, employees are encouraged and enabled, either as individuals or\nmembers of a group, to make their views known, but it is up to management to\naccept or reject their proposals. Deliberative participation, on the other\nhand, places some of traditional management responsibility in the employees\u2019\nhands, as in the case of teamworking or semi-autonomous work groups wherein\nsome authority has been delegated to the workers.\nThe term works councils describes arrangements for the representation of\nemployees, usually at the plant level although they also exist at higher\nlevels (company, group of companies, industry, European Union). The\nrelationship to trade unions is often delineated by legislation or clarified\nby collective agreement, but tensions between these institutions sometimes\nremain all the same. Extensive use of works councils, sometimes called\nworkers\u2019 committees, cooperation committees or otherwise, is well established\nin a number of European countries, such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany\nand the Netherlands and, under the impetus of Directive No. 94/45/EC of 1994\non European works councils, can be anticipated to spread in that region for\nlarge enterprises. Several Central and Eastern European countries, such as\nHungary and Poland, have enacted legislation to encourage the emergence of\nworks councils. They are found as well in some countries in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America; part of the post-apartheid labour law reform in South Africa,\nfor instance, included establishing a form of works councils alongside trade\nunion structures.\nThe possible powers of works councils are best illustrated by the example of\nGermany, although in some ways it is a unique case. Weiss (1992) describes the\nworks council in that country as the form of institutionalized representation\nof interests for employees within an establishment. A works council enjoys\ncertain rights to information, consultation (as in all countries) and co-\ndetermination (much more rare). As the most far-reaching form of\nparticipation, co-determination covers participation in arrangements on health\nand safety at work and the formal adoption of a reconciliation of interests\nand a \u201csocial plan\u201d in the event of a substantial alteration in the\nestablishment, such as a plant closure. Co-determination rights also extend to\nguidelines for staff selection and appraisal, in-service training and measures\naffecting individual workers such as grading, transfer and dismissal. The\nGerman works council is empowered to conclude works agreements at the\nenterprise level and can initiate complaints where it believes the agreement\nis not being honoured. Included in the areas of obligatory collective co-\ndetermination are accident prevention and health protection, works rules,\nworking time, the fixing of performance-related pay rates, the manner of\npayment, general principles governing holidays and others. On these matters,\nthe employer cannot take action without the works council\u2019s agreement. The\nworks council also has the right to take the initiative and can refer a matter\nto the establishment-level arbitration committee for enforcement. As Weiss\n(1992) characterizes it, the works council\u2019s role is \u201cparticipating in the\n\u2018how\u2019 after the employer has made a decision on the \u2018whether\u2019\u201d. The right to\nconsultation affords the works council a chance to play a part in the\ndecisions made by the employer, but failure to consult will not invalidate the\ndecision. The subjects on which consultation is required include protection\nagainst dismissal, protection against technical hazards, training and\npreparation of a social plan.\nThe works council must observe the principles of cooperation with the employer\nand the peace obligation (no work stoppages); it also must cooperate with\ntrade unions present and with the appropriate employers\u2019 organization. Works\ncouncils are bound to conduct their business impartially, without regard to\nrace, religion or creed, nationality, origin, political or union activity, sex\nor age of the employees. The employer provides the facilities for the works\ncouncil, funds it and is liable for its actions.\nWorks councils are elected separately for manual and non-manual workers in\nGermany. Special works council elections are held; while there is no legal\nconnection between these representatives and trade union officers in fact,\nthey often coincide. In Austria and Germany, special representation is ensured\nfor disabled workers and young workers and trainees.\nWorks council members receive no remuneration for this, but necessarily\nincurred expenses are reimbursed. Members are guaranteed retention of their\npay level and job grading after the term of office has expired and enjoy\nspecial protection against dismissal. They are entitled to release from work\nto conduct works council business and attend training. Such protections are in\nline with the Workers\u2019 Representatives Convention (No. 135), which calls for\nworkers\u2019 representatives in an undertaking to enjoy effective protection\nagainst any act prejudicial to them, including dismissal, based on their\nstatus or activities as a workers\u2019 representative (Article 1).\nMany countries feature less ambitious works council schemes that provide for\ninformation and consultation rights. Especially where trade unions have little\npresence on the shop floor level, there is considerable interest in\nintroducing works councils or workers\u2019 committees as a means for workers to\nhave a voice at the workplace level.\nQuality circles and other similar group activities were rapidly introduced in\na large number of enterprises in some Western European countries (e.g., the\nUnited Kingdom and France) at the start of the 1980s and in the United States\na little earlier. They built upon \u201cQuality of Working Life\u201d (QWL) or\n\u201cHumanization of Work\u201d programmes that began in the early 1970s. Their spread\nwas considerably later in some other Western countries (e.g., Germany) and\nstill seems to be very limited in countries where joint project groups are the\npredominant means of dealing with work organization, such as Sweden. They were\nstimulated by a belief that Japan\u2019s ability to produce innovative and high-\nquality products at low cost had something to do with the way human resources\nwere managed in that country; quality circles were the most visible and easily\ntransplantable feature of Japanese human resource management. Quality circles\nare generally expected to produce two types of effect: one is the enhancement\nof quality and productivity and the other is the fostering of a sense of\nparticipation in work-related decisions among workers, leading to increased\njob satisfaction and better industrial relations. In Japan the emphasis has\nbeen placed more on the first aspect and in Europe and North America on the\nsecond. There are also structural differences: while circle leaders are\nnormally appointed by management in Japan, they are often elected in Germany.\nToday, the emphasis of QWL programmes is more on enhancing productivity and\ncompetitiveness (Ozaki 1996).\nIn some of the countries where quality circles were experimented with widely\nin the 1980s, such as France and the United Kingdom, there has been a certain\ndisenchantment with their relative ineffectiveness in producing the expected\nresults. Many circles disappeared a few years after their creation; many\nothers exist on paper, but are in fact moribund. The failure has been\nattributed to many factors \u2013 their tendency to create confusion in the normal\nlines of command, non-management control over membership, circles\u2019 determining\ntheir own agenda without heed for management priorities, lack of enthusiasm or\nhostility on the part of middle management, absence of durable commitment on\nthe part of top management and restriction of scope to minor work-related\nissues.\nRealization of these shortcomings led to the formation of a theory of \u201cTotal\nQuality Management\u201d (TQM). Certain principles of TQM have implications for\nemployee participation: all employees are to participate in the process of\nimproving the business, and responsibility for quality is to be assigned to\npeople who in fact control the quality of what they do. Thus TQM encourages\njob enlargement and enrichment leading to semi-autonomous work groups. It also\npromotes horizontal coordination in a firm through, for example, the use of ad\nhoc, multi-functional or interdepartmental project teams.\nThe practice of establishing joint project groups to study the best ways of\nintroducing technological or organizational changes through the joint efforts\nof managers and workers is a traditional feature of labour relations in some\ncountries, such as Sweden. A joint project group is normally composed of\nmanagers, workplace union representatives and shop-floor workers and often\nassisted by outside experts. The management and the union concerned often\nestablish joint project groups separately on four issues: new technology, work\norganization, training and work environment. The Swedish model of joint\nproject groups presents a notable example of direct participation of shop-\nfloor workers within a framework of established collective labour relations.\nThe system is also found in other countries, such as Germany and Japan.\nSemi-autonomous group work and teamwork are both forms of on-line direct\nparticipation of shop-floor workers in work-related decisions, unlike the\nabove-mentioned joint project group work, which is a form of off-line\nparticipation. The main difference between the two forms of participation lies\nin the degree of autonomy which the members of the team or group enjoy in\norganizing their work. Semi-autonomous group work was used extensively in\nScandinavia, although recently there has been a move back to a more\ntraditional approach; there have been experiments with it elsewhere in Europe\nas well.\nWhile experiments with semi-autonomous group work are generally declining,\nteamwork is spreading fast throughout Western countries. The degree of\nautonomy which a team enjoys varies widely from one company to another. Team\nstructure also differs. In many countries, team leaders are usually appointed\nby management, but in a few countries (e.g., Germany) they are often elected\nby co-workers. Frequently, the creation of teams is accompanied by significant\nchanges in the role of first-line supervisors; they tend to take on greater\nresponsibility for advising team members and for both vertical and horizontal\ncommunication, but lose their supervisory role. Employers have shown\nincreasing interest in teamwork because it tends to facilitate the upgrading\nof workers\u2019 skills and widens the range of workers\u2019 tasks, thus allowing\ngreater flexibility in production processes. However, it is sometimes\ncriticized by workers as a means of inducing them to work harder \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\nby substituting co-workers\u2019 pressure for management control.\nSome commentators include forms of employee ownership or representation on\ncompany boards as expressions of workers\u2019 participation. In Germany and the\nScandinavian countries, among others, workers have indirect participation\nabove the enterprise level by the inclusion of workers\u2019 representatives on\nsupervisory boards. This involves incorporating workers\u2019 representatives in\nthe traditional company board structure, where they are in a minority\n(although sometimes, as in Germany, a numerous one). It does not necessarily\nimply participation in the active management of the company and the workers\u2019\nrepresentatives have the same status as other board members. This means they\nare to put the interests of the company first and foremost and are bound by\nthe same duty of secrecy as other board members. Holding positions on the\nboard may provide access to additional information, however, and a number of\ntrade unions have sought the right to have workers\u2019 representatives on boards.\nIt is a phenomenon now seen in Eastern and Western Europe and North America,\nbut remains rather rare elsewhere.\nAnother expression of workers\u2019 participation is as owners of shares in limited\nliability companies or corporations. Sometimes workers are able to scrape\nenough capital together to purchase a firm that would otherwise be going out\nof business. The rationale behind these situations is that a worker who\nidentifies financially with a company will work harder for its success.\nImportant variables are the form of participation (return on investment rights\nor control rights), its degree (amount and timing of returns) and the reasons\nbehind financial participation. In any event, these practices are largely\nreserved to Europe and North America. If cooperative ventures are considered\npart of this phenomenon, however, the notion of workers being stakeholders in\ntheir work is much more widespread throughout the world. It would be\ninteresting to study whether and to what extent employee ownership of a firm\nor of shares in it has an effect on the workplace safety and health record.\nA specialized form of workers\u2019 participation is seen in the development of\nhealth and safety committees and health and safety representatives (for worker\nparticipation in Denmark, see Box). The legislation of a number of countries\nprovides for the establishment of such committees and for such representatives\n(e.g., Belgium, several provinces of Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands,\nSweden). Smaller companies, variously defined, are usually excluded from such\nmandatory measures, but they, like larger units, often set up health and\nsafety committees on their own initiative. In addition, many collective\nbargaining agreements have led to the creation of such committees and to the\ndesignation of health and safety representatives (e.g., in Canada and the\nUnited States).\nDanish industrial relations provide an example of a country with a number of\ninstitutions that play a role in relation to health and safety. The main\nfeatures are:\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING: Negotiation of agreements by which trade unions and\nemployers fix wages, conditions of work, etc. Pertinent highlights are:\nShop stewards who are elected by workers under collective bargaining\nagreements; enjoy statutory protection against dismissal; serve as channel\nbetween workers and management on working conditions.\nCollective Agreement on Cooperation and Cooperation Committees provides for\ninformation to be given to individuals and groups of workers in advance so\nthey can make their views known before a decision is taken and for the\nestablishment of cooperation committees.\nCooperation committees must be set up in all firms employing more than 35\nworkers (25 in the public service). Joint committees to promote cooperation in\nday-to-day operations; they must be consulted on the introduction of new\ntechnologies and the organization of production; some co-determination rights\non working conditions, training and personal data.\nNational collective agreement on industrial disputes (of 1910) gives workers a\nright (rarely exercised) to stop work if considerations of \u201clife, welfare or\nhonour\u201d make this absolutely necessary. Other collective agreements contain\nprovisions on training and trade unions also provide it.\nFRAMEWORK LAW: The Working Environment Act creates \u201cthe basis on which the\nundertakings themselves will be able to solve questions relating to safety and\nhealth under the guidance of the employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations and\nunder the guidance and supervision of the Labour Inspection Service\u201d (Sec.\n1(b)). The Act establishes a complete system from the plant to the national\nlevel to permit worker participation:\nSafety representatives are elected representatives required in firms employing\nat least ten workers; they enjoy the same protection against dismissal and\nretaliation as shop stewards and are entitled to reimbursement of official\nexpenses.\nSafety groups: The safety representative and the department supervisor form\nthe safety group. Its functions are to:\n\u00b7 monitor working conditions\n\u00b7 inspect equipment, tools, materials\n\u00b7 report any risk which cannot be avoided immediately\n\u00b7 halt production where necessary to avert an imminent serious danger\n\u00b7 ensure that work is performed safely and proper instructions are given\n\u00b7 investigate industrial accidents and occupational diseases\n\u00b7 participate in prevention activities\n\u00b7 cooperate with the occupational health service\n\u00b7 act as link between workers and the safety committee.\nMembers of the safety group are entitled to training and to necessary\ninformation.\nSafety Committees are required in firms employing at least 20 workers. In\nfirms with more than two safety groups, the safety committees consist of\nworkers elected from among safety representatives, two supervisor members and\nan employer\u2019s representative.\nThe functions are:\n\u00b7 planning, directing and coordinating health and safety activities\n\u00b7 being consulted on these matters\n\u00b7 cooperating with other companies engaged in work at the same workplace\n\u00b7 cooperating with the company\u2019s occupational health service\n\u00b7 supervising the activity of safety groups\n\u00b7 making recommendations on prevention of accidents and diseases.\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT COUNCIL involves employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations in\nthe definition and application of preventive policy at the national level.\nComposition: 11 representatives of employee organizations representing manual\nand non-manual workers, one for supervisors, ten of employers\u2019 organizations,\nplus an occupational medical practitioner, a technical expert and non-voting\ngovernmental representatives. Functions:\n\u00b7 is consulted on drafting legislation and regulations\n\u00b7 may on its own initiative take up a health and safety matter\n\u00b7 submits annual recommendations on working environment policy\n\u00b7 coordinates the activities of Trade Safety Councils\n\u00b7 supervises the activity of the Working Environment Fund.\nWORKING ENVIRONMENT FUND is managed by a tripartite board. The Fund has mainly\ninformation and training duties, but also finances research programmes.\nTRADE SAFETY COUNCILS: Twelve Trade Safety Councils examine the problems of\ntheir trade or industry and advise undertakings. They are also consulted on\ndraft legislation. Equal representation of employers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019\norganizations on the one hand and workers\u2019 organizations on the other hand.\nGOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES: In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Labour\nInspection Service and within it, the Danish Institute of the Working\nEnvironment, provide various types of services and advice in the field of\noccupational safety and health. Collective industrial disputes are heard by\nthe Labour Courts.\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from Vogel 1994).\nOften, collective bargaining agreements will strengthen the legislatively\nguaranteed powers afforded to workers\u2019 safety and health representatives. The\ncommittees and representatives vary in regard to their relationship to trade\nunions and works councils, their election or appointment, their duties and\nfunctions and their impact. As a form of workers\u2019 involvement in the\nspecialized sphere of health and safety, such committees and representatives\ncan be a contributing factor to improving both working conditions and the\nlabour relations climate. They have been most successful when they form an\nintegral part of management\u2019s safety and health programme, have access to\nadequate information, involve rank-and-file workers in their activities to\nhelp ensure continuity and are backed up by effective government labour\ninspection. Where employers maintain occupational health services or have\nsafety experts, a fruitful relationship with them can also promote the success\nof joint health and safety committees. A recent workplace survey in the United\nKingdom, for instance, found that \u201cjoint consultative committees, with all\nemployee representatives appointed by unions, significantly reduced workplace\ninjuries relative to those establishments where the management alone\ndetermines health and safety arrangements\u201d (Reilly, Paci and Holl 1995). They\nalso reported an important role for joint consultative committees where\nemployee representatives were appointed in other ways. However, some research\nalso indicates that joint health and safety committees fall short of the\nexpectations held out for them. The reasons suggested for this differ:\ninsufficient support from management, participants who are not adequately\ninformed or trained, workers not represented forcefully enough and so on.\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives may be appointed by management (as\nin many workplaces where no trade union is present), designated by the trade\nunion (as in the United Kingdom) or elected directly by the workers at the\nenterprise or higher level (as in Denmark). A parallel system will be used for\nworker representatives on a joint labour-management health and safety\ncommittee which, while bipartite, will not always have equal representation\nfrom both sides. General institutions for workers\u2019 representation are often\ncomplemented by special representative structures for health and safety (as in\nSpain).\nThe mechanism chosen will often reflect the existence of other labour\nrelations institutions in a country: in France, for instance, employee members\nof the joint health, safety and working conditions committees are appointed by\na delegate elected from the works committee and staff representatives; in\nGermany, members designated by the works council will be among those serving\non a joint health and safety committee. Works councils in the Netherlands may\ndelegate their powers to a safety, health and welfare committee. A strong\nlink, if not identity, between trade union representatives and health and\nsafety representatives is usually seen as desirable (as in Quebec (Canada),\nIreland, Norway and Sweden), but where trade union density is low this runs\nthe risk of depriving large numbers of workers of representation rights in\nrelation to health and safety. Speculation that joint health and safety\ncommittees might lead to extending greater workers\u2019 participation to other\nfields has remained largely unfounded.\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives normally have the following rights:\nto have access to information on health and safety and the introduction of new\ntechnology, to be consulted on these matters, to be involved in monitoring\nworkplace conditions, to accompany inspectors (sometimes called the\n\u201cwalkaround right\u201d), to be involved in accident investigations and to make\nrecommendations to management on the improvement of working conditions. In\nsome countries their powers go beyond this to include the right to engage in\nco-decision making, to initiate inspections and accident investigations and to\nreview management\u2019s reports to government. Most importantly, some workers\u2019\nhealth and safety representatives are empowered to order the shut-down of an\nimminently hazardous operation (also called \u201cred-tagging\u201d, for the marker\nplaced on the spot), as in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. They are in\ncertain instances, such as in France and some provinces of Canada, directly\ninvolved in the enforcement of health and safety regulations. Prior\nconsultation of the joint committee is sometimes necessary before an employer\ncan make any significant change in health, safety or working conditions (as in\nFrance and the Netherlands). In Belgium intercompany health services are under\nthe control of a joint committee. In Italy the committees\u2019 role includes the\npromotion of prevention, and in Greece they can, with the employers\u2019\nagreement, call for expert opinions on health and safety questions.\nWorkers\u2019 health and safety representatives necessarily enjoy protection from\ndiscrimination or retaliation in the exercise of their functions. They are\nentitled to at least some time off with pay, as well as to have the necessary\nmeans (the definition of which is often debated) to exercise their functions.\nIn addition, while in office some are specially shielded from economic layoffs\n(redundancies) or given extra protection from dismissal (as in Belgium).\nFrequently, worker health and safety representatives have a right to receive\nspecialized training (as in Denmark).\nThe effect that workers\u2019 health and safety representatives and joint\ncommittees can have will of course depend not only on rights and duties set\nout in legislation or in a collective bargaining agreement, but on how they\nare exercised in practice. This is in turn influenced by factors that affect\nworkers\u2019 participation generally. Such representatives and joint committees\nare no substitute for the effective government enforcement of health and\nsafety standards or for what may be achieved by means of collective\nbargaining. However, \u201cmost observers believe that (mandated joint health and\nsafety) committees provide a more efficient regulatory regime for safety and\nhealth than inspectorate or civil liability schemes\u201d (Kaufman and Kleiner\n1993). In any event, the trend is definitely towards greater workers\u2019\nparticipation in health and safety matters, at least in terms of collective\nagreements covering larger enterprises and legislation. Where they operate as\neffective institutions, joint health and safety committees can be a valuable\ntool for identifying problems and raising awareness of hazards, thus\npotentially reducing the incidence of injury, disease and death on the job.\nThe extent to which they are effective, however, depends on a large range of\nvariables in the particular labour relations system and in the strategic\napproach taken to health and safety at the workplace.\nSchregle (1994) has commented:\nIn practice, none of these workers\u2019 participation schemes has produced the\nexpected results. There are many reasons for this. One is that, in a general\nway, trade unions and employers do not have the same view of participation.\nWhile it is the workers\u2019 desire to exert a tangible and concrete influence on\nemployers\u2019 decisions in the sense of power-sharing, employers insist on\nmanagement rights or management prerogatives, derived from private ownership,\nto run the business according to their own criteria and decision-making power,\naffording to workers at most the right to express their views and positions\nwithout binding effect on management. The result of all this is confusion over\nsuch terms as consultation, workers\u2019 participation, workers\u2019 participation in\nmanagement, co-determination, co-management, etc.\nThe fact remains that in most workplaces around the world, there is little\neffective employee participation at the enterprise level. The first level of\nparticipation and indeed a prerequisite for it, is the provision of\ninformation, followed by consultation. Within Europe, research has indicated a\nwide variation in the extent of implementation of the 1989 framework directive\non health and safety, when it comes to workers\u2019 participation; it may get a\nnew lease on life with the impetus of the 1995 directive on European works\ncouncils. A high degree of non-participation also characterizes other regions.\nNevertheless, high hopes continue to be held out for strengthening mechanisms\nfor workers\u2019 participation at the enterprise level.\nThe traditional approach to workers\u2019 participation as promotional of greater\nworker-management cooperation falls short of being satisfactory in relation to\nhealth and safety issues, where the categorization of labour relations as\nconflictual or cooperative does not particularly advance the debate. As Vogel\n(1994) notes:\n...the problem of worker participation is clearly not confined to the\ninstitutionalized forms of participation in or outside the undertaking. The\nbasis of participation lies in the recognition that distinct interests are in\nplay giving rise to specific rationales... The essential legitimacy of\nparticipation is to be found outside the firm in a democratic requirement\nwhich refuses to admit that the self-determination of individuals should be\nconfined within the rules of political representation and in a view of health\nconceived as a purposeful, social process through which individuals and\ncommunities develop strategies for self-fulfilment and defence.\nIn the end, the differing functions of various workers\u2019 participation schemes\nmake it difficult to assess their comparative impact. As collective bargaining\nshrinks in coverage, however, greater use of management-led workers\u2019\nparticipation arrangements may be expected.\nMarco Biagi\nWorker participation in safety organization in plants can be planned in many\nways, depending on national law and practice. This article refers only to\nconsultation and information arrangements, not related forms of employee\ninvolvement. Additional coverage of specific aspects somewhat linked with\nconsultation and information (e.g., participation in or initiation of\ninspections, participation in training activities) is offered elsewhere in\nthis chapter.\nThe idea of employers and employees working jointly to improve health and\nsafety at work is based on several principles:\n1\\. Workers can contribute to prevention of industrial accidents by spotting\nand warning about potential hazards and giving notice of imminent dangers.\n2\\. Involving employees educates and motivates them to cooperate in the\npromotion of safety.\n3\\. Ideas and experiences of workers are regarded as a useful contribution to\nsafety improvement.\n4\\. People have a right to be involved in decisions that affect their working\nlife, particularly their health and well-being.\n5\\. Cooperation between the two sides of industry, essential to improve\nworking conditions, should be based on an equal partnership.\nThese principles have been laid down in the ILO Occupational Safety and Health\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155). Article 20 provides that \u201cco-operation between\nmanagement and workers and/or their representatives within the undertaking\nshall be an essential element of organizational and other measures\u201d in the\narea of occupational health and safety. Also the ILO Communications within the\nUndertaking Recommendation, 1967 (No. 129), Paragraph 2(1), underlines that:\n...employers and their organizations as well as workers and their\norganizations should, in their common interest, recognise the importance of a\nclimate of mutual understanding and confidence within undertakings that is\nfavourable both to the efficiency of the undertaking and to the aspirations of\nthe workers.\nThe underlying philosophy is that employers and employees have a common\ninterest in a self-regulating system in industrial accident prevention;\nactually they are more interested in occupational safety than in occupational\nhealth, since the occupational origin of accidents is more simple to establish\nand they are thus compensated more easily. Also for this reason safety\nrepresentatives in many countries were historically the first employee\nrepresentatives at the workplace to have their rights and duties determined by\nlaw or collective agreements. Today there is probably no subject in labour\nrelations and human resources management on which the social partners are so\nready to collaborate as in health and safety matters. But in some national\ncontexts trade unions have not put sufficient resources into the safety and\nhealth effort to make it a major issue in either negotiations or contract\nadministration.\nThe general obligation for employers to disclose information in health and\nsafety matters to workers and/or their representatives and seek their opinion\nvia consultative arrangements is provided by Article 20 of the ILO Prevention\nof Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174). This norm prescribes\nthat \u201cthe workers and their representatives at a major hazard installation\nshall be consulted through appropriate cooperative mechanisms in order to\nensure a safe system of work\u201d. More specifically workers and their\nrepresentatives have the right to:\n(a) be adequately and suitably informed of the hazards associated with the\nmajor hazard installation and their likely consequences; (b) be informed of\nany orders, instructions or recommendations made by the competent authority;\n(c) be consulted in the preparation of and have access to, the following\ndocuments: (i) safety reports, (ii) emergency plans and procedures, (iii)\naccident reports.\nAs a consequence of these information and consultation rights, workers are\nentitled \u201cto discuss with the employer any potential hazards they consider\ncapable of generating a major accident\u201d (Article 20(f)).\nMore generally ILO Convention No. 155 lays down rules concerning occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment, providing for effective\narrangements at the level of the undertaking (be they regulated by law or\ncollective bargaining or even left to local/domestic practices) under which\n\u201c(c) representatives of workers... are given adequate information on measures\ntaken by the employer to secure occupational safety and health and may consult\ntheir representative organizations about such information provided they do not\ndisclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article 19). The same norm adds that under these\narrangements workers or their representatives must be \u201cenabled to enquire into\nand are consulted by the employer, on all aspects of occupational safety and\nhealth associated with their work\u201d. And for this purpose \u201ctechnical advisers\nmay, by mutual agreement, be brought in from outside the undertaking\u201d.\nILO Recommendation No. 164 supplementing Convention No. 155 (Paragraph 12)\nclarifies that information and consultation rights on safety and health\nmatters should be granted to a variety of participatory institutions: workers\u2019\nsafety delegates, workers\u2019 safety and health committees, joint safety and\nhealth committees and other workers\u2019 representatives. This text also states\nimportant principles affecting the nature and the content of\ninformation/consultation. These practices should first of all enable the\nabove-mentioned specialized forms of workers\u2019 representation \u201cto contribute in\nthe decision-making process at the level of the undertaking regarding matters\nof safety and health\u201d (Article 12(e)).\nThese are not simply rights to know and to be heard: workers and their\nrepresentatives should \u201c(a) be given adequate information on safety and health\nmatters, enabled to examine factors affecting safety and health and encouraged\nto propose measures on the subject\u201d. They should also \u201c(b) be consulted when\nmajor new safety and health measures are envisaged and before they are carried\nout and seek to obtain the support of the workers for such measures\u201d and\n\u201c(c)... in planning alterations to work processes, work content or\norganization of work, which may have safety or health implications for the\nworkers\u201d.\nThe principle under which \u201crepresentatives of the workers... should be\ninformed and consulted in advance by the employer on projects, measures and\ndecisions which are liable to have harmful consequences on the health of\nworkers\u201d (ILO Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration)\nRecommendation, 1977 (No. 156), Paragraph 21) reflects the idea of an\n\u201ceffective policy of communication\u201d stated in general terms by Paragraph 3 of\nILO Recommendation No. 129, which prescribes that \u201cinformation is given and\nthat consultation takes place between the parties concerned before decisions\non matters of major interest are taken by management\u201d. And in order to make\nthese practices effective, \u201csteps should be taken to train those concerned in\nthe use of communications methods\u201d (Para. 6).\nThe participative approach in labour relations in the area of health and\nsafety is confirmed by other international legal texts. A meaningful example\nin this respect is offered by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the\nintroduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of\npeople working in countries of the European Union. Article 10 provides for the\nemployer an obligation to take appropriate measures so that workers and/or\ntheir representatives receive, in accordance with national law and/or\npractices, all necessary information\u201d concerning safety and health risks,\nprotective and preventive measures (also for first aid, fire-fighting and\nevacuation of workers and in case of serious and imminent danger). This\ninformation has to be \u201cprovided in a suitable form to temporary workers and\nhired workers present in the establishment or enterprise\u201d. Additionally\n\u201cworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of\nworkers, or workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the\nsafety and health of workers\u201d must have access to risk assessment and\nprotective measures, reports on occupational accidents and illnesses suffered\nby workers and all information yielded by protective and preventive measures,\ninspection agencies and bodies responsible for safety and health.\nArticle 11 of the EC Directive links consultation and participation. In fact\nemployers are under the obligation to \u201cconsult workers and/or their\nrepresentatives and allow them to take part in discussions on all questions\nrelating to safety and health at work\u201d. That presupposes \u201cthe consultation of\nworkers, the right of workers and/or their representatives to make proposals\n(and) balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or\npractices\u201d. The document continues, prescribing that:\nworkers with specific functions in protecting the safety and health of workers\nor workers\u2019 representatives with specific responsibility for the safety and\nhealth of workers shall participate in a balanced way, in accordance with\nnational laws and/or practices, or be consulted in advance and in due time by\nthe employer...\nThe objective of these rights is to cover all measures which may substantially\naffect health and safety, including the designation of employees required to\nimplement certain measures (first-aid, fire-fighting and evacuation of\nworkers) and the planning and organization of adequate health and safety\ntraining throughout the employment relationship (upon hiring, job transfer,\nintroduction of new working equipment, introduction of any new technology).\nThe choice is clear: no to conflict, yes to participation in health and safety\nlabour relations. This is the meaning of the EC Framework Directive, which\ngoes beyond the simple logic of the right to information. The system is based\non a genuine form of consultation, since it must take place \u201cin advance and in\ngood time\u201d \u2013 in other words, not only prior to decisions being adopted by the\nemployer but also soon enough for proposals and comments to be made about\nthem.\nThe Directive also uses the ambiguous expression \u201cbalanced participation\u201d, a\nformula open to various interpretations. The notion is broader than (or, at\nleast, different from) that of consultation, but not to the extent of\nconstituting a form of joint decision making, which would prevent employers\nfrom taking measures which had not been approved by the workers or their\nrepresentatives. It seems quite clearly to be a form of participation going\nbeyond mere consultation (otherwise the article heading \u201cconsultation and\nparticipation\u201d would be nonsense) but not necessarily as far as joint decision\nmaking. The concept is left somewhat vague: it embraces a range of multiple\nforms of worker participation which vary considerably between Member States of\nthe European Union. And in any case the Directive does not place any\nobligation to provide a specific form of balanced participation.\nIn both the ILO and EC texts, information seems to be a concept whereby\nmanagement informs the employees\u2019 representatives body in writing or in a\nmeeting. Consultation means that normally joint committees are set up in which\nemployees\u2019 representatives are not merely informed by management, but can also\ncomment and expect justification from management in the event of differing\nopinions. Certainly these concepts differ from negotiation (when a\ncontractually binding outcome is worked out in joint negotiating committees at\ncompany or inter-company level) and co-determination (where the employee has a\nright of veto and decisions require the agreement of both parties).\nFor Community-scale undertakings and groups thereof, EU Council Directive No.\n94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 requires setting up European Works Council or an\ninformation and consultation procedure. The information relates \u201cin particular\nto transnational questions which significantly affect workers\u2019 interests\u201d\n(Article 6(3)). Time will tell if this is used for safety and health purposes.\nThe active nature of consultation is also stressed in Article 11(3) of the EC\nFramework Directive, which states that either workers with specific functions\nin this area or workers\u2019 representatives in general \u201cmay call on the employer\nto take appropriate measures and submit to him relevant proposals by means of\nwhich all risks to workers may be reduced and/or sources of danger\neliminated\u201d.\nThe Framework Directive, with its provisions on risk management, while placing\nclear responsibilities on employers, also favours the greater involvement of\nworkers and their representatives in consultations on management strategies in\nhealth and safety. Employers must assess risks and present their risk-control\nmanagement systems in a plan or statement. In all cases they are expected to\nconsult with and involve workers and/or their representatives in all the\ndesign, implementation and monitoring of these systems. But it is undeniable\nthat this Directive, by conferring relevant participative rights to workers,\nhas at the same time adopted an approach of \u201cself-assessment\u201d. Other EC\nDirectives require, among other things, the recording of the results of\nmeasurements and examinations and lay down the employees\u2019 rights of access to\nthese records.\nAlso ILO Recommendation No. 164 (Para. 15(2)) provides that:\n...employers should be required to keep such records relevant to occupational\nsafety and health and the working environment as are considered necessary by\nthe competent authority or authorities; these might include records of all\nnotifiable occupational accidents and injuries to health which arise in the\ncourse of or in connection with work, records of authorisation and exemptions\nunder laws or regulations in the field and any conditions to which they may be\nsubject, certificates relating to supervision of the health of workers in the\nundertaking and data concerning exposure to specified substances and agents.\nIt is a general principle worldwide that employers are required to keep\nrecords, for instance of accidents and occupational diseases, or on the use or\npresence of biological and environmental monitoring.\nBy comparison, labour relations systems exist (e.g., Italy) where statutory\nlaw provides no specific right to information and consultation in occupational\nsafety and health for workers\u2019 representatives, although such a right is often\nincluded in collective agreements. Italian legislation gives the workers\nthemselves the right to control the implementation of standards relating to\nthe prevention of accidents and occupational diseases, as well as the right to\ndevelop studies and adopt adequate measures in order to safeguard health and\nsafety at work. In other systems (e.g., in the United Kingdom) in order to\nobtain disclosure of information on matters of health and safety as provided\nby law, it is necessary first to have safety representatives appointed; but\nthis is possible only if there is a recognized trade union in existence at the\nundertaking. In situations where the employer refuses or withdraws the\nnecessary status of a recognized trade union, information and consultation\nrights cannot be exercised.\nThese national experiences raise the question: To what extent is effective\nworkers\u2019 participation in health and safety conditional on the adoption of\nstatutory arrangements? Certainly some legal backing seems to be helpful, the\noptimum amount of legislation being probably at a point where it provides for\nthe election of workers\u2019 representatives with sufficiently strong rights to\nallow them to function independently of management, while at the same time\nleaving room for a certain variety in the organizational arrangements for\nparticipation in different sectors and corporations.\nIn general labour relations systems provide by law that workers\u2019\nrepresentatives are to be informed and consulted in health and safety matters.\nWhen joint committees composed of management and employee representatives are\nestablished, they enjoy considerable powers. For instance in France the\ncommittee for health, safety and working conditions may propose preventive\nmeasures: an employer declining to accept them must give detailed reasons. But\nempirical evidence demonstrates that sometimes safety representatives seem\nmore efficient than joint committees since they are less dependent on the\nexistence of a cooperative relationship.\nThrough various forms of representational participation, employees in general\nenjoy rights recognized by ILO Conventions and Recommendations (plus EC\ndirectives, when applicable) mentioned earlier with special reference to\nindustrialized free-market economies. Safety representatives and/or works\ncouncillors have a right to be informed and consulted by the employer on all\nissues relating to the company\u2019s operations and the improvement of working\nconditions, including health and safety matters. They have the right to see\nall relevant documents that the employer is statutorily obliged to keep and\nalso to see any statements on the subject and the results of any research.\nThey may also have copies of any of these documents if required.\nApart from specific aspects (such as use of experts, participation in or\ninitiation of inspections, protection from victimization) which strongly\naffect the effectiveness of information and consultation rights in health and\nsafety, there are general factors which have to be taken into account in this\nrespect. First, the size of the undertaking: the effectiveness of controls is\non the wane in small units, where trade unions and other forms of workers\u2019\nrepresentation are almost absent. Small-sized establishments are also least\nlikely to implement statutory requirements.\nSecondly, where safety representatives are integrated into the formal trade\nunion organization at the workplace, they are more likely to achieve the\nexpected improvements in the working environment. Thirdly, consultation and\ninformation arrangements in health and safety reflect the more conflictual\n(e.g., UK, Italy) or cooperative (e.g., Germany, Scandinavian countries,\nJapan) nature of the surrounding labour relations system. And in general,\ncollaboration between management and labour favours the disclosing of\ninformation and consultation.\nFourthly, the role of managerial initiative should not be underestimated. More\nthan the existence of statutory rights, consultation and information are\neffective when there is the presence of a managerial culture which supports\nthem. Employers\u2014by their attitude towards training, their commitment to\ndisclosing information and their speed in answering queries\u2014are able to create\nan adversarial or cooperative climate. Legal backing is essential to guarantee\nfull independence to worker representatives to act in this field, but then the\nsuccess of information/consultation arrangements depends largely on the\nvoluntary choice of both sides of industry.\nLastly it must be said that a precondition for successful worker\nrepresentation in health and safety at the workplace is public awareness. It\nis fundamental for this specialized form of employee involvement that such a\nneed is perceived and valued by people at work. There is empirical evidence\nthat workers identify health and safety as one of the most significant\nconcerns in their working life.\nComparative experience demonstrates that in general safety representatives are\nconsidered to be in breach of confidence if they reveal any information\nrelating to an employer\u2019s production processes and other professional secrets.\nFurthermore, they are obliged to use discretion with regard to any information\nprovided to them which the employer indicates is confidential. ILO Convention\nNo. 155 recognizes this by providing that enterprise-level representatives may\nconsult their representative organizations about occupational health and\nsafety information \u201cprovided they do not disclose commercial secrets\u201d (Article\n19(c)).\nIn some systems (e.g., Greece) employee representatives on works councils are\nobliged not to communicate to third parties information acquired which is of\nfundamental importance to the enterprise and which, if disclosed, would harm\nthe enterprise\u2019s competitiveness. The employee representatives and the\nemployer are supposed to decide jointly what information can be disclosed.\nUnder other systems (e.g., Luxembourg), where if employee representatives\ndisagree with an employer\u2019s classification of information as confidential,\nthey may refer the matter to the inspectorate for a decision.\nIn some countries the duty of confidentiality is only implicit (e.g., Italy).\nAlso when there is no specific requirement in this respect (e.g., United\nKingdom), employee representatives cannot receive from the employer\ninformation relating to the health of individuals (unless their consent is\ngiven), information that would damage national security or information that\nwould damage the employer\u2019s undertaking. Finally (e.g., Sweden) the duty to\nobserve confidentiality may not prevent safety representatives from passing on\nthe information received to the executive board of their trade union, which\nwill also be bound to observe confidentiality.\nMel Doyle\nA training system should be a constituent of an overall human resource\ndevelopment policy and programme. This may be at the enterprise, industry or\nnational level. Its practical implementation will be greatly assisted if paid\neducational leave is available (see box). Where such arrangements are not\nincorporated into national legislation (as they are in the Labour Codes of\nFrance and Spain, for example), then leave entitlement to attend appropriate\noccupational safety and health training should be negotiated by\nrepresentatives of employers and workers as part of the collective bargaining\nprocess.\nTo promote education and training during working hours, with financial\nentitlements.\nA ratifying State is to formulate and apply a policy designed to promote the\ngranting of paid educational leave for training at any level; general, social\nand civic education; trade union education.\nThis policy is to take account of the stage of development and the particular\nneeds of the country and shall be coordinated with general policies concerning\nemployment, education and training, and hours of work.\nPaid educational leave shall not be denied to workers on the grounds of race,\ncolour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social\norigin.\nFinancing shall be on a regular and adequate basis.\nThe period of paid educational leave shall be treated as a period of effective\nservice for the purpose of establishing claims to social benefits and other\nrights deriving from the employment relationship.\nby Chapter Editor (excerpted from ILO Convention No. 140, 1974).\nAny negotiated arrangements for training would identify appropriate subject\nmatter as well as administrative, financial and organizational arrangements.\nTraining on occupational safety and health should embrace the following:\n\u00b7 health and safety laws and means of enforcement\n\u00b7 employers\u2019 attitudes to health and safety\n\u00b7 workers\u2019 attitudes to health and safety\n\u00b7 health and safety issues and the means of improving health and safety\npractices.\nThe two key components of any training approach are content and process. These\nwill be determined by the objectives of the training activity and the\naspirations of the participants and trainers. The overall objective here would\nbe to contribute to the improvement of health and safety at the workplace and\nso content should be based on identifying practical means of achieving\nimprovement. Such an approach would require an assessment of the health and\nsafety problems faced by workers. In general terms these should include:\n\u00b7 safety hazards, such as lifting, carrying, machinery, falls, ladders\n\u00b7 health hazards and problems, such as eyestrain, chemicals, noise, dust,\naches, pains\n\u00b7 welfare issues, such as washing facilities, first aid, housing.\nThis methodological approach would allow for the systematic treatment of\nissues by means of describing the problem and reviewing how it came to be\nknown, who was involved, what action was taken and the result of the action.\nAn important outcome of this approach is the identification of \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d occupational safety and health practices, which, theoretically at least,\ncan provide the basis for common action by employers and workers. To sustain\nthis methodology, important information requirements need to be addressed.\nThese include securing documentation on health and safety laws, standards and\ntechnical information and identifying the further information required to\nresolve the hazard/problem, such as policies or agreements produced by other\ntrade unions and employers and alternative solutions and strategies.\nSuccessful training activity will require the use of active learning methods,\nwhich are developed by drawing on the experience, skills, knowledge, attitudes\nand objectives of participants. Experience and knowledge are reviewed,\nattitudes are analysed and skills are developed and improved through working\ncollectively. As part of this process, participants are encouraged to apply\nthe results of their training activity to their work environment. This focuses\ntraining activity on practical outcomes and relevant content.\nQuestions that the trainer and trainees need to ask of process and content\nare: What are we gaining that can be applied to our work environment? Is the\ntraining improving our skills and knowledge? Is it helping us to operate more\neffectively in our work environment?\nThe trainer should address these questions at the planning, implementation and\nevaluation stages of any training programme and the methodological process\nencourages participants to make the same demands during the process of\ntraining activity.\nSuch a method, often referred to as \u201clearning through doing\u201d, draws widely\nupon the participants\u2019 experiences, attitudes, skills and knowledge. The\nobjectives of training activity should always refer back to practical\noutcomes; therefore, training activities should integrate this method. In\noccupational safety and health programmes this could include the activities\noutlined in table 21.1.\nActivity\nRelated skills\nIdentifying hazards\nCritical analysis\nSharing information\nReviewing information\nProblem solving\nCritical analysis\nSharing information\nWorking collectively\nDeveloping strategies\nFinding information\nUsing resources\nResearching skills\nRe-using information\nForming attitudes\nCritical analysis\nRe-evaluation of attitudes\nEffective argument and debate\nOccupational safety and health training has the potential to develop workers\u2019\nand employers\u2019 awareness of issues and to provide a basis for common action\nand agreement on how problems can be overcome. In practical terms, good health\nand safety practice not only provides for improvement in the working\nenvironment and potential productivity gains, but also encourages a more\npositive attitude to labour relations on the part of the social partners.\nMar\u00eda Luz Vega Ruiz\nThe key role played by labour inspection in the development of labour\nrelations is indisputable; in fact, the history of labour law is the history\nof the labour inspection system. Before the establishment of the first labour\ninspectorates, labour laws were mere declarations of goals whose infringement\nresulted in no sanctions. True labour law arose when a specific body was\ncharged with ensuring compliance with the rules, thereby giving effect to the\nlaw by means of legal sanctions.\nThe first national attempts to establish a system of labour inspection centred\non the creation of voluntary bodies which acted without remuneration to\nprotect women and children employed in industry and which were a response to\nthe peculiar nature of economic liberalism. Experience soon imposed the\nnecessity to create a body of a coercive nature that would really be able to\nprotect the working population as a whole. The first law introducing an\nofficial factory inspectorate was passed in Great Britain in 1878 on the\ngrounds that the requirements relating to the appointment of honorary\nenforcers had not been faithfully carried out and therefore the protection\nmeasures had not been applied. The law conferred on factory inspectors the\nfollowing basic powers: unrestricted entry into factories, free questioning of\nworkers and employers, requiring the production of documents and the capacity\nto settle disputes and ascertain infringements of the laws.\nThe evolution of the various regulations had the result in subsequent years of\nreaffirming the authority of factory inspectors as administrative officials,\nseparating out and gradually eliminating their function as judges. The idea\nemerged of the inspector as a paid civil servant but also a participant in the\nlabour relations system, an official of the state who ensures that the\ngovernment shows its human side through his or her direct presence in the\nworkplace. With this goal in mind, the inspectorate was converted into a basic\norgan for the development and application of legislation; it became, in fact,\na fundamental pillar of social reform.\nThis dual concept of its activities (strict control and active observation of\nthe facts) reveals the origins of inspectoral activity within legal\ninstitutions. On the one hand, the labour inspectorate works with clear,\nspecific legal texts which have to be applied; and, on the other hand, the\ncorrect articulation and exercise of its functions lead it to interpret the\nletter of the law by means of direct action. The inspector has to know not\nonly the letter of the law, but also the spirit behind it and he or she must\ntherefore be sensitive to the world of work and have a profound knowledge not\nonly of the rules but also of the technical and production procedures. Thus\nthe inspectorate is an organ of labour policy, but also a creative institution\nof progress, progress that is fundamental to the very evolution of labour law\nand labour relations.\nThe evolution of the world of work has continued to deepen and reinforce the\nrole of the inspectorate as an independent organ of control at the centre of\nthe labour relations sphere. In a parallel way, modification and change in the\nworld of work generate new aims and forms of internal relationships in the\ncomplex microcosm that is the workplace. The original concept of a\npaternalistic type of relationship between the inspector and those subject to\ninspection gave way early on to more participatory action by the\nrepresentatives of employers and workers, with the inspector involving the\ninterested parties in his or her activities. Hence the role of conciliator in\ncollective disputes was assigned to labour inspectors right from the beginning\nin the legislation of many countries.\nTogether with the consolidation of the role of the state inspector, advances\nin the trade union movement and professional organizations aroused a greater\ninterest on the part of the workers themselves in active participation in\ninspection. After various attempts by the workers to incorporate themselves in\ndirect inspectorial action (e.g., attempts to establish worker-inspectors as\nexisted in Communist countries), the independent and objective status of the\ninspectorate came to be favoured, with its definitive transformation into a\nstate organ consisting of civil servants. However, the participatory attitude\nof the workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 representatives was not lost in their contacts\nwith the new institution: the inspectorate, in addition to being an\nindependent entity, was also converted into a participant holding a special\nplace in the dialogue between those representatives.\nFrom this perspective the inspectorate developed progressively and in parallel\nwith social and economic evolution. For example, the protectionist tendency of\nthe state during the first third of the twentieth century resulted in\nsubstantial modifications in labour law, adding a considerable number of\ngraduates to those already enrolled as inspectors. One immediate consequence\nof these developments was the creation of a true labour administration.\nSimilarly, the emergence of new forms of work organization and the pressure of\nmarket forces on the public service at the end of the twentieth century have\nof course also affected the labour inspectorate in many countries.\nThe inspectorate, originally conceived as a body of legal controllers, has\nmodified its own activity over time and converted itself into a useful and\nintegrated mechanism responsive to the technological needs of new forms of\nwork. In this way labour law has also grown, adapting itself to the new needs\nof production/services and incorporating regulations of a technical nature.\nHence the appearance of related sciences: the sociology of labour, ergonomics,\noccupational safety and health, labour economics and so on. With new emphases\nand perspectives going beyond the purely legal sphere, the inspector became an\nactive element of the true application of rules in workplaces, not only by\nvirtue of applying sanctions but also by advising employers\u2019 and workers\u2019\nrepresentatives.\nThe national regulations themselves have adopted two different organizational\napproaches to inspection: the generalist inspectorate (which arose in\ncontinental Europe) and the specialist inspectorate (which originated in the\nUnited Kingdom). Without entering into the arguments concerning the advantages\nof one or the other system, the terminology of the titles reveals two quite\ndifferent perspectives. On the one hand, the generalist (also called unitary)\napproach involves inspectorial action performed by a single person, assisted\nby various technical institutions, on the assumption that the general\nappreciation of a single inspector can provide a more logical and coherent\nbasis for the solution of various labour problems. The generalist inspector is\nan arbiter (in the sense of the word used in ancient Rome) who, having\nconsulted with the relevant specialized bodies, tries to respond to the\ndifficulties and problems posed by the particular workplace. The generalist\ninspector handles labour relations disputes directly. The specialist\ninspectorate, on the other hand, takes direct action through the use of a pre-\neminently technical inspector, who has to resolve specific problems within a\nmore narrow scope. In a parallel manner, purely labour relations questions are\ndealt with by bipartite or sometimes tripartite mechanisms (employers, trade\nunions, other government agencies), which try to resolve conflicts through a\ndialogue among them.\nDespite the differences between the two trends, the point of convergence lies\nin the fact that the inspector continues to be a living expression of the law.\nIn the generalist inspection system, the inspector\u2019s central position allows\nhim or her to recognize immediate needs and make modifications accordingly.\nThe Italian situation is particularly illustrative of this: the law empowers\nthe inspector to issue executory rules to complement the general regulations,\nor to substitute more specific regulations. In the case of the specialist\ninspectorate, the inspector\u2019s in-depth knowledge of the problem and of the\ntechnical standards allows him or her to assess possible non-compliance with\nreference to the legal requirements and prevention of hazards and also to\npropose alternative solutions for immediate application.\nThe central role of the inspector means that, in addition to his or her\nsupervisory function, the inspector frequently becomes a pillar of support for\nexisting social institutions in the labour field. Apart from the function of\ngeneral control as regards legal requirements concerning working conditions\nand workers\u2019 protection, the inspectorate in many countries supervises the\nfulfilment of other requirements relating to social services, the employment\nof foreign workers, vocational training, social security and so on. To be\neffective, a labour inspectorate should have the characteristics embodied in\nthe ILO\u2019s Labour Inspection Convention, 1947 (No. 81): sufficient staffing\nlevels, independence, adequate training and resources and the powers necessary\nto carry out inspections and to achieve solutions to the problems found.\nIn many countries the inspection services are also given responsibilities in\nthe resolution of labour disputes, participation in the negotiation of\ncollective agreements at the request of the parties, activities relating to\nthe gathering and evaluation of socio-economic data, drafting memoranda and\nexpert technical advice in their fields for the labour authorities and other\nfunctions of a purely administrative nature. This extension and multiplicity\nof tasks arises from the concept of the inspector as an expert in labour\nrelations with specific technical knowledge. It also reflects a special vision\nof a framework for the operation of enterprises which sees the inspectorate as\nthe ideal institution for evaluating and solving the difficulties of the world\nof work. However, this multidisciplinary character in some cases gives rise to\na basic problem: dispersion. It may be asked whether labour inspectors, being\nobliged to assume multiple responsibilities, do not run the risk of having to\nfavour activities of an economic or other nature to the detriment of those\nwhich should be the essence of their mission.\nThe major controversy over the determination of the typical and priority\nfunctions of the inspectorate relates to the function of conciliation of\nlabour disputes. Although surveillance and supervision surely make up the\ndaily activity of the inspector, it is no less certain that the workplace is\nthe centre of labour conflict, whether individual or collective. The question\nthus arises as to whether all the control and evaluation activity of the\ninspectorate does not imply, in some measure, \u201cpalliative\u201d action as regards\nconflict itself. Let us examine an example: the inspector who suggests the\napplication of legal requirements concerning noise is in many cases responding\nto a complaint from the workers\u2019 representatives, who consider that the high\ndecibel level affects work performance. When advising the employer, the\ninspector is proposing a measure for resolving an individual conflict\ngenerated within day-to-day working relationships. The solution may or may not\nbe adopted by the employer, without prejudice to the subsequent initiation of\nlegal action in case of non-compliance. In a similar manner, an inspector\u2019s\nvisit to a workplace to examine whether an act of anti-union discrimination\nhas occurred is aimed at diagnosing and if possible eliminating, internal\ndifferences that have arisen in that respect.\nTo what extent are the prevention and solution of conflicts different in the\ndaily activity of the inspector? The answer is not clear. The close\nintermeshing of all the spheres that form part of the labour field means that\nthe inspectorate is not only a living expression of the law but also a central\ninstitution in the labour relations system. An inspectorial body that examines\nthe world of work as a whole will be able to assist in securing better\nconditions of work, a safe working environment and, as a result, improved\nlabour relations.\nShauna L. Olney\nIn recent years, legislation, international instruments and general literature\non occupational health and safety have highlighted the importance of\ninformation, consultation and cooperation between workers and employers. The\nfocus has been on averting disputes rather than their settlement. Some contend\nthat in the area of occupational safety and health, the interests of workers\nand employers converge and thus disputes can be more easily avoided. Yet\ndisputes still arise.\nThe employment relationship is subject to diverging interests and priorities\nas well as changing concerns, including with respect to health and safety\nconsiderations. The potential thus exists for disagreement or conflicts which\nmay harden into labour disputes. Although there may be a consensus regarding\nthe importance of health and safety issues in general, disagreement may arise\nregarding the need for specific measures or their implementation, particularly\nwhere extra time or money is involved or production will be decreased. When\ndealing with health and safety, there are few absolutes: what is an\n\u201cacceptable\u201d risk, for instance, is relative. Where to draw the line on a\nnumber of issues is open to debate, particularly since complicated situations\nmay have to be addressed with limited technical assistance and a lack of\nconclusive scientific evidence. Also, perceptions in this area are continually\nshifting as a result of the use of new technology, medical and scientific\nresearch, changing societal attitudes and so on. The potential for diverging\nviews and dispute in this area is, therefore, considerable.\nIn all areas of labour relations, but perhaps particularly with respect to\nhealth and safety concerns, the equitable and efficient resolution of disputes\nis essential. Disputes may be resolved at an early stage as a result of one\nside to the dispute making the other aware of relevant facts. This may be done\nformally or informally. Disputes may also be dealt with through internal\ncomplaints procedures, usually involving progressively higher levels of\nmanagement. Conciliation or mediation may be needed to facilitate the\nresolution of the dispute, or a solution may be imposed by a court or an\narbitrator. In the health and safety area, the labour inspector may also play\nan important role in dispute settlement. Some disputes may lead to work\nstoppages, which in the case of health and safety issues may or may not be\nconsidered a strike under the law.\nWithin the purview of health and safety considerations, a variety of types of\ndispute may arise. Although the categories may not always be obvious, giving\nthe dispute a particular definition is often important for determining the\nmechanisms for settlement that will be applied. Disputes in general can be\nclassified as individual or collective, depending on who initiates, or has the\nauthority to initiate, the dispute. Generally, an individual dispute is one\ninvolving an individual worker and a collective dispute involves a group of\nworkers, usually represented by a trade union. A further distinction is often\nmade between rights disputes and interest disputes. A rights dispute (also\ncalled a legal dispute) involves the application or interpretation of rights\nunder law or an existing provision set out in a contract of employment or a\ncollective agreement. An interest dispute, on the other hand, is a dispute\nregarding the creation of rights or obligations or the modification of those\nalready in existence. Interest disputes primarily arise in relation to\ncollective bargaining.\nSometimes defining a dispute as collective or individual will determine the\nresolution procedures; however, it is usually the interaction between the\ncategories that is relevant \u2013 collective rights disputes, collective interest\ndisputes and individual rights disputes are usually given distinct treatment.\nThis article deals only with the first two categories, but it should be kept\nin mind that some stages in the process of collective disputes will coincide\nwith those for individual claims.\nWhether a dispute is considered to be collective or individual may depend on\nwhether the law allows the trade union to raise a dispute on the issue in\nquestion. To obtain authority to negotiate over health and safety and other\nissues, in a number of countries a trade union needs to be registered with the\npublic authorities or to be recognized as being representative of a given\npercentage of the employees concerned. In some countries, these prerequisites\nalso apply with respect to the authority to raise rights disputes. In others,\nthe employer must voluntarily agree to deal with the trade union before the\ntrade union can act on behalf of the employees.\nA trade union may be able to initiate procedures to settle a collective rights\ndispute where health and safety obligations affecting the workplace as a whole\nare at issue: for example, if there is a provision in the collective agreement\nor in legislation providing that noise levels are not to exceed a certain\nlimit, particular precautions are to be taken with respect to machinery, or\npersonal protective equipment is to be provided and the employer does not\ncomply with these provisions. Collective rights disputes may also arise, for\nexample, where the employer fails to consult with or provide information to\nthe health and safety committee or representative as required by law or the\ncollective agreement. Due to its inherently collective nature, an alleged\nbreach of the collective agreement may in some countries be considered a\ncollective dispute, particularly if it concerns the implementation of\nprovisions of general applicability such as those on safety and health, even\nif in reality only one worker is immediately and directly affected by the\nemployer\u2019s breach. Breach of legal provisions may be considered collective\nwhere the trade union acts on behalf of all affected workers, where it is\nentitled to do so as a result of the breach.\nCollective interest disputes over health and safety matters may also take many\nforms. Such disputes could arise out of negotiations between a trade union and\nan employer over the formation or responsibilities of a health and safety\ncommittee, the introduction of new technology, specific measures for dealing\nwith hazardous materials, environmental control and so on. The negotiations\nmay involve general statements of principle regarding health and safety or\nspecific improvements or limits. Where the parties reach an impasse in the\nnegotiations, dealing with the dispute is considered an extension of the\nfreedom to bargain collectively. In the Collective Bargaining Convention, 1981\n(No. 154), the ILO has noted the importance of setting up bodies and\nprocedures for the settlement of labour disputes as part of the process of\npromoting collective bargaining (Article 5(2) (e)).\nThe term grievance procedure is generally used to mean internal procedures set\nout in the collective agreement to resolve disputes regarding the application\nor interpretation of the collective agreement (rights disputes). Similar\nprocedures are, however, often set up even in the absence of a union or\ncollective agreement to address problems and complaints of workers, as they\nare seen to be a fairer and less costly means of dispute resolution than\nlitigation (McCabe 1994). The collective agreement normally provides that the\ncomplaint is to be dealt with through a multi-stage procedure involving\nincreasingly higher levels within the organization. For example, a dispute on\na health and safety matter may go first to the immediate supervisor. If not\nresolved at the first stage, the supervisor and the health and safety\nrepresentative may then undertake an investigation, the findings of which are\nsubmitted to a manager or perhaps the health and safety committee. If the\ndispute remains unresolved, a senior level of management may then intervene.\nThere may be several stages which need to be exhausted before outside\nprocedures are set in motion. The agreement may go on to provide for third\nparty intervention in the form of inspection, conciliation and arbitration,\nwhich will be discussed in more detail below.\nThe Examination of Grievances Recommendation (No. 130), adopted by the ILO in\n1967, underlines the importance of grievance procedures for rights disputes,\nwhether individual or collective. It states that workers\u2019 organizations or the\nrepresentatives of workers in the undertaking should be associated with the\nemployers in the establishment and implementation of the grievance procedures\nwithin the undertaking. Rapid, uncomplicated and informal procedures are\nurged. Where procedures within the undertaking are exhausted without a\nmutually acceptable resolution being reached, the Recommendation goes on to\nset out procedures for final settlement, including joint examination of the\ncase by the employers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations, conciliation or arbitration\nand recourse to a labour court or other judicial authority.\nThe collective agreement or law may require collective disputes to be\nsubmitted to conciliation or mediation before further dispute settlement\nprocedures can be invoked. Even without being required to submit a dispute to\nconciliation, the parties may voluntarily ask a conciliator or mediator, an\nimpartial third party, to assist them in reducing their differences and\nultimately reaching an agreement. In some industrial relations systems, a\ndistinction is made, at least in theory, between conciliation and mediation,\nthough in practice the line is difficult to draw. The role of conciliators is\nto re-open the lines of communication, if they have been broken, to help the\nparties to find common ground so that an agreement can be reached and perhaps\nmake findings of fact. The conciliator does not, however, present formal\nproposals to resolve the dispute (although in practice such a passive role is\nseldom adopted). A mediator, on the other hand, is expected to propose terms\nof settlement, though the parties remain free to accept or reject the\nproposals. In many countries there is no real distinction between conciliation\nand mediation, with both mediators and conciliators seeking to assist the\nparties to a dispute to find a solution, using the most appropriate tactics of\nthe moment, sometimes remaining passive, sometimes putting forth proposals for\nsettlement.\nConciliation is one of the most widely used and is considered to be one of the\nmost effective procedures for the settlement of disputes over interests. In\nthe process of collective bargaining, conciliation can be seen as the\ncontinuation of negotiations with the assistance of a neutral party. In a\ngrowing number of countries, conciliation is also used at the initial stages\nof settling rights disputes. The government may make conciliation services\navailable or may set up an independent body to provide such services. In some\ncountries, labour inspectors are involved in conciliation.\nThe ILO, through the adoption of the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration\nRecommendation, 1951 (No. 92), has advocated that free and expeditious\nvoluntary conciliation machinery be \u201cmade available to assist in the\nprevention and settlement of industrial disputes between employers and\nworkers\u201d (Paras. 1 and 3). The role of conciliation in ensuring the effective\nexercise of the right to bargain collectively is reflected in the European\nSocial Charter (10 October 1961, Article 6(3)).\nArbitration involves the intervention of a neutral third party who, though not\na member of the established judiciary, is authorized to impose a decision. In\nseveral countries, virtually all rights disputes arising out of the\napplication or interpretation of the collective agreement are dealt with\nthrough binding arbitration, sometimes following an obligatory and\nunsuccessful conciliation stage. Arbitration is available in many countries as\na voluntary procedure, while in others it is compulsory. Where arbitration is\nimposed as a method of resolving disputes over interests it is usually limited\nto the public service or essential services. In some countries, however,\nparticularly developing countries, arbitration of interest disputes is more\ngenerally applicable.\nArbitration is dealt with in the Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration\nRecommendation, 1951 (No. 92). As with conciliation, the Recommendation\nconcerns itself with disputes that are voluntarily submitted to arbitration\nand provides that in such cases the parties should abstain during the\nproceedings from striking or locking out and should accept the arbitration\naward. The voluntary nature of submission to arbitration is also stressed in\nthe European Social Charter (ibid.). If one of the parties or public\nauthorities can initiate arbitration proceedings, arbitration is considered to\nbe compulsory. The ILO\u2019s Committee of Experts on the Application of\nConventions and Recommendations has stated that, in the case of interest\ndisputes, compulsory arbitration is generally contrary to the principles of\nthe Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98), as\nit vitiates the autonomy of the bargaining parties (ILO 1994b). A final award\nbinding on the parties concerned, if they have not voluntarily submitted a\ndispute to arbitration, may also be viewed as unreasonably limiting the right\nto strike. The Committee of Experts has stated that \u201csuch a prohibition\nseriously limits the means available to trade unions to further and defend the\ninterests of their members, as well as their right to organize their\nactivities and to formulate their programmes, and is not compatible with\nArticle 3 of Convention No. 87 [the Freedom of Association and Protection of\nthe Right to Organize Convention, 1948].\u201d (ibid., para. 153.)\nThe labour administration in most countries has a variety of responsibilities,\nof which one of the most important is inspecting work premises to ensure\ncompliance with the laws on employment, in particular those on health and\nsafety. Inspectors do not require a labour dispute in order to intervene.\nHowever, where a dispute alleges a violation of the law or agreement, they may\nplay an important role in achieving its settlement.\nIn dispute settlement, labour administration authorities generally play a more\nactive role in health and safety matters than in other areas. The role of the\ninspector in disputes may be defined in collective agreements or legislation\ninvolving health and safety, general labour law, workers\u2019 compensation or a\nspecific industry. In some countries, the health and safety representative or\ncommittee is entitled to lodge complaints with the labour inspector, or other\npublic labour or health and safety officer, against the employer. The\ninspector may be requested to intervene where there is an allegation that\nhealth and safety regulations are not being observed. The labour\nadministration authorities may also be required to intervene due to their\ncompetence under state workers\u2019 compensation schemes.\nThe inspectors may have authority to issue improvement, prohibition or stop-\nwork orders, levy fines or penalties or even initiate prosecutions. Civil or\ncriminal proceedings may be available depending on the nature of the\nviolation, the seriousness of the consequences, prior knowledge of the likely\nconsequences and whether the violation has been repeated. An inspector\u2019s\ndecision can normally be reviewed on appeal to a higher public officer, a\nspecialized labour or health and safety body or the court. Separate\nadministrative and appeal mechanisms may exist for different industries (e.g.,\nmining).\nThe Labour Inspection Recommendation (No. 81), adopted by the ILO in 1947,\nencourages collaboration between officials of the labour inspectorate and\nworkers\u2019 and employers\u2019 representatives. European Union Framework Directive\nNo. 89/391/EEC on Health and Safety adopted in 1989 provides that workers and\ntheir representatives are entitled to appeal to the authority responsible for\nhealth and safety protection at work if they are not satisfied that the\nmeasures taken by the employer will ensure safety and health at work.\nAccording to the Directive, workers\u2019 representatives are to have the\nopportunity to submit their observations during inspection visits by the\ncompetent authority (Article 11(6)).\nSince rights disputes involve rights or obligations that are already in\nexistence, the general principle underlying their settlement is that they are\nto be resolved ultimately by courts or arbitrators and not through industrial\naction, such as a strike. Some countries leave ordinary courts to deal with\nall disputes over rights, irrespective of their labour relations character.\nHowever, in many countries, labour courts (called in some countries\n\u201cindustrial courts\u201d) or specialized tribunals will deal with rights disputes.\nThey may deal with rights disputes generally or only certain types of\ndisputes, such as claims of unjustified discipline or dismissal. The principal\nreason for having such specialized judicial bodies is the need for speedy,\ninexpensive and informal procedures and specialized capacity in labour\nmatters. The delays and expenses involved in the ordinary court system are not\nconsidered acceptable when dealing with employment, which is an area of\ncrucial importance to a person\u2019s life and often involves a relationship that\nmust continue even after the dispute is settled. Jurisdiction over collective\nrights disputes may be divided between the ordinary and the labour courts: for\ninstance in some countries the only collective disputes that a labour court is\ncompetent to adjudicate are those arising out of an alleged breach of a\ncollective agreement, leaving breaches of legal provisions to the regular\ncourts.\nOften representatives of workers and employers as well as an independent judge\nsit on labour courts or tribunals. Labour courts consisting of only workers\u2019\nand employers\u2019 representatives also exist. This bipartite or tripartite\ncomposition is aimed at ensuring that the members have expertise in industrial\nrelations matters and, therefore, that relevant issues will be canvassed and\ndealt with in light of practical realities. Such composition also assists in\ngiving credibility and persuasiveness to the decision. The workers\u2019 and\nemployers\u2019 representatives may have an equal voice in determining the outcome\nof the dispute or they may be entitled to act only in an advisory capacity. In\nother countries, judges unaffiliated to either side of industry resolve\ncollective rights disputes.\nIn a few countries, labour courts deal both with collective rights disputes\nand interest disputes. As discussed above with respect to arbitration, where\nadjudication is compulsory for interest disputes, the voluntary nature of\ncollective bargaining is undermined.\nA concerted work stoppage may take place for a variety of reasons. Most\ncommonly it is understood as a form of pressure on the employer to agree to\nterms and conditions once an impasse has been reached in the collective\nbargaining process. This is considered to be a strike in most countries and is\nnormally viewed as a legitimate means of workers and their organizations to\npromote and protect their interests.\nThe right to strike is expressly recognized as a general right under the\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (16 December\n1966, Article 8(1) (d)). The European Social Charter (supra, Article 6(4))\nlinks the right to strike to the right to bargain collectively and states that\nworkers and employers are to have the right to collective action in cases of\nconflicts of interest, subject to obligations arising out of the collective\nagreement. The Charter of the Organization of American States (30 April 1948,\nArticle 43(c)) defines the right to strike as an integral element of freedom\nof association, along with the right to collective bargaining. The ILO\u2019s\nCommittee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and\nGoverning Body Committee on Freedom of Association have recognized the right\nto strike as arising out of the general principles of freedom of association\nset out in the Freedom of Association and Right to Organize Convention, 1948\n(No. 87), though the right to strike is not mentioned specifically in the text\nof the Convention. The Committee of Experts has stated that \u201ca general\nprohibition of strikes constitutes a considerable restriction of the\nopportunities opened to trade unions for furthering and defending the\ninterests of their members... and of the right of trade unions to organize\ntheir activities\u201d (ILO 1994b, para. 147).\nIn some countries the right to strike is a right of a trade union and thus\nstrikes not organized or authorized by the trade union are considered\n\u201cunofficial\u201d and unlawful. In other countries, however, the right to strike is\na right of the individual, even though it is normally exercised by a group, in\nwhich case the distinction between \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cunofficial\u201d strikes is of\nlittle significance.\nEven where the right to strike is recognized in principle, certain categories\nof workers may be excluded from enjoying the right, such as members of the\npolice or armed forces, or senior public servants. The right may also be\nsubject to certain procedural limitations, such as requiring prior notice to\nbe given or a ballot to be taken in support of the strike. In a number of\ncountries, the parties are obliged to refrain from striking or locking out,\neither absolutely or on issues regulated in the agreement, while the\ncollective agreement is in force. This \u201cpeace obligation\u201d is often set out\nspecifically in legislation or collective agreements, or may be implied\nthrough judicial interpretation. The right to strike in many countries is\nseverely restricted, or even prohibited, in essential services. This\nrestriction is permitted under ILO principles if the services to which it\napplies are limited to those the interruption of which would endanger the\nlife, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population. (ILO\n1994b, para. 159.)\nIn the field of disputes over health and safety issues, a distinction must be\nmade between those relating to negotiating for certain rights (for instance,\ndetermining the precise functions of a safety representative in the\nimplementation of a general health and safety policy) and those relating to\nsituations of imminent danger. Where a dangerous situation exists, or is\nbelieved to exist, legislation or collective agreements generally give workers\nthe right to stop work. This is often expressed as an individual right of the\nworker or workers who are directly at risk. A variety of formulas exist for\njustifying a work stoppage. An honest belief that a danger exists may suffice,\nor an objective danger may need to be shown. Regarding who is in danger,\nworkers may cease working if they are immediately threatened, or the right may\nbe broader and include causing danger to others. Collective work stoppages in\nsolidarity (sympathy strikes) are not generally envisaged by the provisions\n(and therefore may be considered unlawful), but in fact they do take place.\nAuthority to stop work may also be vested in the workplace health and safety\nrepresentatives. Work may then be suspended pending a final decision by labour\nadministration authorities.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No. 155), provides that\nworkers shall not suffer undue consequences from having removed themselves\nfrom a work situation which they believe presents an imminent and serious\ndanger to their life or health (Article 13). A similar provision can be found\nin Article 8(4) of the European Union\u2019s 1989 Framework Directive, which refers\nto \u201cserious, imminent and unavoidable danger\u201d. Often the right to stop work\ndue to imminent danger is contained in health and safety legislation. In some\ncountries, the right is embodied in labour legislation and conceived as a work\nstoppage that does not constitute a strike; therefore, the procedural\nprerequisites for a strike do not need to be met and the peace obligation is\nnot breached. Similarly, where an employer closes the workplace in compliance\nwith a stop-work order or because of a reasonable belief that a dangerous\nsituation exists, it is generally not considered to give rise to a lockout.\nAnne Trebilcock\nAn individual dispute arises from a disagreement between an individual worker\nand his or her employer over an aspect of their employment relationship. An\nindividual dispute exemplifies a \u201crights dispute\u201d, that is a dispute over the\napplication of the terms of legislation or an existing agreement, whether a\ncollective bargaining agreement or an individual written or oral contract of\nemployment. Thus there could be a dispute over the amount of wages paid or\ntheir manner of payment, work schedules, working conditions, entitlement to\nleave and so forth. In the field of health and safety an individual dispute\nmay arise in relation to the use of personal protective equipment, extra\npayments for carrying out dangerous work (hazard pay \u2013 a practice now frowned\nupon in favour of eliminating hazards), refusal to perform work that poses an\nimminent danger and observance of health and safety rules.\nAn individual dispute may be initiated by a worker complaining to vindicate\nwhat he or she believes to be a right, or reacting to employer-imposed\ndisciplinary action or dismissal. If a dispute involves similar claims on\nbehalf of individual workers, or if an individual dispute raises a point of\nimportant principle for a trade union, an individual dispute can also lead to\ncollective action and, where new rights are then sought, to an interests\ndispute. For instance, a single worker who refuses to perform work that he or\nshe thinks is too hazardous may be disciplined or even dismissed by the\nemployer; if the trade union sees that this work poses a continuing danger for\nother workers, it may take up the issue with collective action, including a\nwork stoppage (i.e., a lawful strike or a wildcat strike). In this way, an\nindividual dispute may lead to and become a collective dispute. Similarly, the\nunion may see a point of principle which, if not recognized, will lead it to\nmake new demands, thus giving rise to an interests dispute in future\nnegotiations.\nThe resolution of an individual dispute will depend largely upon three\nfactors: (1) the extent of legal protection afforded to workers in a\nparticular country; (2) whether or not a worker falls under the umbrella of a\ncollective agreement; and (3) the ease with which a worker can have\nenforcement of his or her rights, whether they are afforded by law or\ncollective agreement.\nIn most countries, however, certain rights enjoyed by an individual will be\nthe same no matter what the length of his or her engagement or the size of the\nenterprise. These normally include protection against victimization for trade\nunion activity or for reporting to the authorities an employer\u2019s alleged\ninfringement of the law, called \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d protection. In most\ncountries, the law affords protection to all workers against discrimination on\nthe basis of race or sex (including pregnancy) and, in many cases, religion,\npolitical opinion, national extraction or social origin, marital status and\nfamily responsibilities. Those grounds are all listed as improper bases for\ndismissal by the ILO Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158),\nwhich also adds to them: union membership and participation in union\nactivities; seeking office as, or acting or having acted as, a workers\u2019\nrepresentative; and filing a complaint, or participating in proceedings\nagainst an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations, or\nhaving recourse to administrative authorities. These last three are clearly of\nparticular relevance to the protection of workers\u2019 rights in the field of\nsafety and health. The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of\nConventions and Recommendations recently highlighted the seriousness of\nretaliatory measures, in particular in the form of termination of employment,\ntaken against a worker who reports the employer\u2019s failure to apply\noccupational safety and health rules while the workers\u2019 physical integrity,\nhealth and even lives may be at risk. When fundamental rights or the physical\nintegrity of lives of workers are at stake, it would be desirable for\nconditions as to proof (reversal of the burden of proof) and measures of\nredress (reinstatement) to be such as to allow the worker to report illegal\npractices without fearing reprisals (ILO 1995c).\nHowever, when it comes to retention of employment in practice, two major\ndeterminants of an individual\u2019s employment rights are the enforcement\nmechanism available to vindicate these rights and the type of contract of\nemployment under which he or she has been engaged. The longer the term of the\nengagement, generally the stronger the protection. Thus a worker still in the\nprobationary period (in most countries a matter of a few months) will have\nlittle or no protection from dismissal. The same is true for a casual worker\n(i.e., a person engaged on a day-to-day basis) or a seasonal worker (i.e., one\nemployed for a limited, recurring period). A worker with a contract of\nemployment for a fixed term will have protection during the period covered by\nthe contract, but will normally not have a right to its renewal. Workers\nengaged on contracts that are without limit of time are in the most secure\nposition, but they may still be dismissed for specified reasons or more\ngenerally for what is often termed \u201cgross misconduct\u201d. Their jobs may also be\neliminated in the course of company restructuring. With increasing pressures\nfor greater flexibility in the labour market, the recent trend in legislation\ngoverning contracts of employment has been to make it easier for employers to\n\u201cshed labour\u201d in the restructuring process. In addition, a number of new forms\nof work relationships have arisen outside the traditional one of\nemployer/employee. Without employee status, the individual concerned may have\nlittle legal protection.\nAn individual dispute may often arise around the question of an employee\u2019s\nrefusal to perform work that he or she believes to pose an imminent hazard;\nthe belief must be that of a reasonable person and/or be held in good faith.\nIn the United States the reasonable belief must be that performance of the\nwork constitutes an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury. In\nsome countries, this right is negotiated in collective bargaining; in others,\nit exists by virtue of legislation or court interpretations. Unfortunately,\nthis important right is not yet universally recognized, despite its inclusion\nas a basic principle in Article 13 of the ILO Occupational Health and Safety\nConvention, 1981 (No. 155). And even where the right exists in law, employees\nmay fear retaliation or job loss for exercising it, particularly where they do\nnot enjoy the backing of a trade union or an effective labour inspectorate.\nThe right to refuse such work is normally accompanied by a duty to inform the\nemployer immediately of the situation; sometimes the joint safety committee\nmust be informed as well. Neither the worker who refused nor another in his or\nher place should be (re)assigned to the work until the problem has been\nresolved. If this happens nonetheless and a worker is injured, the law may (as\nin France and Venezuela) subject the employer to severe civil and criminal\npenalties. In Canada, both the worker who refused the work and the health and\nsafety representative have rights to be present while the employer undertakes\nan on-the-spot investigation. If the employee still refuses to do the work\nafter the employer has taken remedial measures, an expedited government\ninspection can be triggered; until that has led to a decision, the employer\ncannot require the worker to do that work and is supposed to provide him or\nher with an alternative assignment to avoid earnings loss. A worker designated\nto replace the one who refused must be advised of the other\u2019s refusal.\nRecognition of a right to refuse hazardous work is an important exception to\nthe general rule that the employer is the one who assigns work and that an\nemployee is not to abandon his or her post or refuse to carry out\ninstructions. Its conceptual justification lies in the urgency of the\nsituation and the presence of interests of public order to save life (Bousiges\n1991; Renaud and St. Jacques 1986).\nAnother way in which an individual dispute can arise in connection with a\nhealth and safety issue is the participation of an individual in strike action\nto protest unsafe working conditions. His or her fate will depend on whether\nthe work stoppage was lawful or unlawful and the extent to which the right to\nstrike is guaranteed in the particular circumstances. This will involve not\nonly its status as a collective right, but how the legal system views the\nemployee\u2019s withdrawal of labour. In many countries, going on strike\nconstitutes a breach of the employment contract on the part of the employee\nand whether this will be forgiven or not may well be influenced by the overall\npower of his or her trade union vis-\u00e0-vis the employer and possibly the\ngovernment. A worker who has a strong theoretical right to strike but who can\nbe temporarily or permanently replaced will be reluctant to exercise that\nright for fear of job loss. In other countries, engaging in a lawful strike is\nexplicitly made one of the grounds on which a worker\u2019s employment may not be\nbrought to an end (Finland, France).\nThe ways in which an individual dispute can be resolved are in general the\nsame as those available for the resolution of collective disputes. However,\ndifferent labour relations systems offer varying approaches. Some countries\n(e.g., Germany, Israel, Lesotho and Namibia) provide labour courts for the\nresolution of both collective and individual disputes. The labour courts in\nDenmark and Norway hear only collective disputes; individual workers\u2019 claims\nmust go through the regular civil courts. In other countries, such as France\nand the United Kingdom, special machinery is reserved for disputes between\nindividual workers and their employers. In the United States, individuals have\nrights to bring actions claiming unlawf\u00f9l employment discrimination before\nbodies that are distinct from those before which unfair labour practice claims\nare pressed. However, in non-union situations, employer mandated arbitration\nfor individual disputes is enjoying popularity despite criticism from labour\npractitioners. Where an individual is covered by a collective bargaining\nagreement, his or her grievance can be pursued by the trade union under that\nagreement, which usually refers disputes to voluntary arbitration. An\nindividual\u2019s ability to win a claim may ofien depend on his or her access to\nprocedures that are fair, affordable and rapid and whether he or she has the\nsupport of a trade union or an able labour inspectorate.\nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 1915.

The first was the **signing of the renewals of the collective\nagreements** in the public sector, following a blockade that dated back to\n2010.

Employment results\nwere positive, with an increase in the number of employed and a reduction in\nunemployment. In December 2018, the employment rate reached 58.8% (up 0.7\npercentage points since December 2017) and unemployment stood at 10.3% (down\nby 0.6 pp). Employment growth involved both men and women as well as the\nyouth. The youth unemployment rate was 31.9 at the end of 2018. The overall\nincrease in employment was the result of a reduction in open-ended contracts\n(down by 0.6 percentage points since December 2017) and an increase in\ntemporary contracts (up by 8.9) and self-employed (0.6% more).\n\nMore information on:\n\n  * European Commission: EURES \\- Living and working in Italy\n  * European Industrial Relations Dictionary: Undeclared work\n  * Data: Tackling undeclared work in Europe\n\n## Legal context\n\nRelationships between employers and employees are regulated in considerable\ndetail by Italian law and \u2013 where applicable \u2013 by the relevant National\nCollective Bargaining Agreement (NCBA), which leaves only a few matters to be\nsettled by individual negotiations and agreements.

Recently, new union\u2013employer\njoint bodies ( _enti bilaterali_ ) have been created with the aim of better\nsupporting both workers and employers when production levels decrease and\nworking activity must be suspended or reduced (entirely, in some cases).

However, the agreement TU 2014 has been difficult to implement,\ndue to a number of administrative difficulties linked to the collection and\ncertification of data on union membership. On 4 July 2017, the signatories to\nthe agreement had signed a new procedural agreement to entrust to the National\nsocial security institute (Inps) the calculation of the representativeness\nindicators. They also defined a new procedure for the collection of data in\n2018, until 10 December. According to the agreement, Inps should have carried\nout the preliminary calculations by the end of May 2019 and informed the\nparties of the results. By the end of July 2019, the Management Committee\nresponsible for the administration of the agreement, after having heard the\ninterested parties, shall proclaim the results for each registered industry-\nwide agreement. Currently, there is no information about the progress of the\nprocedure.\n\nIn 2018, the major employer confederation Confindustria and the confederal\nunions Cgil, Cisl and Uil reached a cross-industry agreement on the bargaining\nsystem (9 March 2019, \u2018The Factory Pact\u2019 \u2013 _Patto della fabbrica_ ). The\nagreement is meant to accompany the transformation and digitalization of\nmanufacturing and services, with an emphasis on effectiveness and\nparticipation. The agreement introduces a set of guidelines on the content and\ninstitutions of industrial relations and provides some indications on some\nissues of mutual interest on which future deals shall be negotiated. In\nparticular, it covers the certification of representativeness and it\nunderlines the necessity to extend it to employer associations; it confirms\nthe two-tier structure of the bargaining system, with the sectoral as the main\npillar, and the company or territorial as the second level, according to the\nindustry practices, and it identifies a number of issues which shall be\ncovered by future negotiations, such as contractual welfare, training and\nskill development, health and safety as a privileged area for the development\nof participatory industrial relations; active labour market policies to ensure\na more inclusive and dynamic labour market; participatory practices,\nespecially through innovative work organisational patterns which shall be\npromoted by second-level agreements.

Employment results\nwere positive, with an increase in the number of employed and a reduction in\nunemployment. In December 2018, the employment rate reached 58.8% (up 0.7\npercentage points since December 2017) and unemployment stood at 10.3% (down\nby 0.6 pp).

They are interlocking parts in a multilevel\nsystem of governance that includes the European, national, sectoral, regional\n(provincial or local) and company levels. This section looks into the main\nactors and institutions and their role in Italy.\n\n## Public authorities involved in regulating working life\n\nPublic authorities are not so much involved in social dialogue at national\nlevel, but the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, the Ministry of\nEconomic development and local authorities are often required to facilitate\nsocial dialogue at company level in case of company crisis (that is,\ncollective agreements signed in the case of collective dismissals or related\nto workers\u2019 income support measures). In some rare and particular cases (that\nis, leading businesses or partly state-owned companies), the government itself\ntries to foster, mediate, and support social dialogue.\n\nAnother important actor is the National Agency for Active Labour Market\nPolicies (ANPAL). ANPAL is supposed to perform a range of tasks: coordination\nof the network of services for labour policies; monitoring and evaluation;\ndefinition of service standards for employment services; definition of\nprofiling methodologies; and management of the network of vocational education\nand training (VET) providers and of the organisations that will be involved in\nimplementing ALMPs. Moreover, ANPAL coordinates programmes, also funded\nthrough EU resources, aimed at promoting employability.\n\n## Representativeness\n\nCriteria to define social partners\u2019 representativeness have been modified\nseveral times over the years. The first and only provision, until 1970, was\ncontained in Article 39 of the Italian Constitution, which sets forth a single\ncriterion based on the number of associates. Pursuant to the 1970 Workers\u2019\nStatute, trade unions that participate in the negotiations of the collective\nagreements applied in the workplace can set up trade union workplace\nrepresentation structures ( _Rappresentanze sindacali aziendali_ , RSA), which\nconsist of union delegates in companies with more than 15 employees, in the\nindustry or service sectors.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding signed on 3 July 1993 ( _Protocollo d\u2019Intesa_\n, PI 1993, in Italian, 95 KB DOC), which was entered into by social partners\nand the government, set out that RSU can be set up by workers by means of\nelections and in lieu of RSA.\n\nOn 14 January 2014, Confindustria, CGIL, CISL, and UIL signed a new cross-\nsectoral agreement (TU 2014) whereby new rules on representativeness were\nestablished. In particular, according to TU 2014, in order to participate in\nnational collective bargaining, trade unions must reach a representativeness\nthreshold of 5% measured as the average of the percentage of union members and\nof the votes obtained by the same unions in RSU elections. NCBAs are binding\nif signed by trade unions reaching a representativeness level of 50% +1 and if\napproved by the majority of workers through a referendum.\n\nMoreover, TU 2014 states that firm-level agreements are binding if signed by\nthe majority of RSU members or by the RSA receiving the majority of proxies\nfrom employees.\n\nMore information on representativeness of the main social partner\norganisations can be found in Eurofound\u2019s representativeness study of the\ncross-industry social partners or in Eurofound\u2019s sectoral representativeness\nstudies.\n\n## Trade unions\n\n#### About trade union representation\n\nEmployees enjoy the constitutionally enshrined right to organise unions and to\nstrike. Labour unions are usually set up on an industry or trade-wide basis,\nwith the various local unions forming a national body. NCBAs are implemented\nby employers\u2019 associations and unions and are legally binding only upon\nemployers and employees either belonging to the organisations that have signed\nthem, or that have chosen to adopt them. A de facto extension of such\ncollective bargaining is set out by labour courts. If the company is staffed\nwith more than 15 employees, they have the right to organise RSA or RSU.\nEither type of council can exercise the right to be informed and consulted\nmainly in the following cases: collective dismissal, business transfer, in\ncase the company intends to install work or personal control devices directly\ninvolving employees, or in any other case provided for by the relevant NCBA.\nArticle 39 of the Italian Constitution states that \u2018trade unions may be freely\nestablished\u2019 without restrictions or limitations. This, jointly with Article\n18 of the Italian Constitution (\u2018Citizens have the right to form associations\nfreely [\u2026] for those ends that are not forbidden by criminal law\u2019) confers\nupon workers wide freedom of union association.\n\n#### Trade union membership and trade union density\n\n|\n\n**2010**\n\n|\n\n**2011**\n\n|\n\n**2012**\n\n|\n\n**2013**\n\n|\n\n**2014**\n\n|\n\n2015\n\n|\n\n**Source**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Trade union density in terms of active employees**\n\n|\n\n35.5\n\n|\n\n35.7\n\n|\n\n36.3\n\n|\n\n36.9\n\n|\n\n36.4\n\n|\n\n35.7\n\n|\n\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on administrative data on member released by the\nthree main union confederations.  \n  \n**Trade union membership in 1000s**\n\n|\n\n100.9\n\n|\n\n102.1\n\n|\n\n103.5\n\n|\n\n102.7\n\n|\n\n100.5\n\n|\n\n99.8\n\n|\n\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on Istat, Migration and calculation of yearly\nresident population (2011-2013), Intercensual register population estimates\n(2010).  \n  \n#### Main trade union confederations and federations*\n\n**Long name**\n\n|\n\n**Abbreviation**\n\n|\n\n**Members**\n\n|\n\n**Involved in collective bargaining**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Italian General Confederation of Work (Confederazione Generale Italiana del\nLavoro)**\n\n|\n\nCGIL\n\n|\n\n2,772,928 (active workers) 518,774\n\n2,745,846 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Confederation of Workers\u2019 Unions (Confederazione Italiana Sindacati\nLavoratori)**\n\n|\n\nCISL\n\n|\n\n2,329,085 (active workers)\n\n1,711,738 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Union of Italian Workers (Unione Italiana del Lavoro)**\n\n|\n\nUIL\n\n|\n\n1,682,983 (active workers)\n\n573,091 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Pensioners\u2019 Union (Sindacato Pensionati Italiani)**\n\n|\n\nSPI-CGIL\n\n|\n\n2,745,846 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Federation of Workers in the Trade, Tourism, and Service Sectors\n(Federazione Italiana Lavoratori Commercio, Turismo e Servizi)**\n\n|\n\nFILCAMS-CGIL\n\n|\n\n578,410 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**CGIL Public Employment Union (CGIL Funzione Pubblica)**\n\n|\n\nFP-CGIL\n\n|\n\n380,568 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**National Pensioners\u2019 Federation (Federazione Nazionale Pensionati)**\n\n|\n\nFNP-CISL\n\n|\n\n1,711,738 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Tourism, Trade Service,\nand Related Sectors (Federazione Italiana Sindacati Addetti Servizi\nCommerciali, Affini e del Turismo)**\n\n|\n\nFISASCAT-CISL\n\n|\n\n366,899 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**CISL Public Employment Union (CISL Funzione Pubblica)**\n\n|\n\nCISL FP\n\n|\n\n244,705 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Union of Retired Workers (Unione Italiana Lavoratori Pensionati)**\n\n|\n\nUILPENSIONATI\n\n|\n\n573,091 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Union of Agrifood Occupations (Unione Italiana dei Lavori\nAgroalimentari)**\n\n|\n\nUILA\n\n|\n\n226,551 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**UIL Federation of Local Authorities and Health (UIL Federazione Poteri\nLocali)**\n\n|\n\nUIL FPL\n\n|\n\n204,964 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n_Notes: * Please note that data on trade union membership are not official or\nformally certified, as they are not validated by independent authorities.

No. 99).\n\nCNEL is managed by 64 board members, nominated every five years. Specifically,\n10 members are appointed directly by the President of the Republic: two being\nproposed by the President of the Council of Ministries, while the others are\nnominated by the President of the Republic following a consultation procedure\nwhere social partners and non-governmental organisations propose board members\nwithin the respective quotas.\n\nCNEL has the right to initiate legislation and it carries out many important\nfunctions such as drafting reports, opinions and surveys upon request of\nParliament, Government or Regions on draft acts or on relevant issues\nconcerning economic and social policies. Furthermore, CNEL manages,\nimplements, and updates the National Archives of bargaining agreements.\n\nJoint union-employer bodies ( _enti bilaterali_ ) are set up jointly by\nemployers and trade unions with the aim of providing their members with\nwelfare and services. These institutions have become increasingly important in\nrecent years. There are several types of joint bodies, and they can be\nestablished by employers\u2019 associations and trade unions at cross-sectoral or\nsectoral level. They are managed jointly by social partners, and have an\ninternal organisational structure consisting of an assembly, an executive\nboard, a president, an executive director, and a monitoring committee. These\nadministrative bodies are usually appointed by social partners every three or\nfour years. Joint bodies deal with several issues, such as wages, skills,\ntraining, working time, and unemployment scheme benefits. They can be\nclassified into institutional funds and non-institutional funds.\n\nThey can be considered as institutional funds inasmuch as the law sets out\nspecific goals for collective bargaining to be pursued through funds, or\nalternatively specific schemes to be implemented through them; this category\nincludes pension funds, private healthcare funds, unemployment funds, and\nvocational training funds. Non-institutional funds are those that pursue goals\nor implement schemes that are self-regulated by collective bargaining.\n\n#### Main tripartite and bipartite

representation co-exist in Italy: RSA\nand RSU. RSA are established at company level at the workers\u2019 initiative\nwithin those trade unions that signed the NCBA applied in the company\nconcerned, as provided for by the Workers\u2019 Statute. According to TU 2014, RSU\nare established by the trade unions that signed the cross-sectoral agreements\ndated 28 June 2011 (in Italian, 1002 KB PDF) and 31 May 2013 (in Italian, 266\nKB PDF), as well as by the trade unions that signed the NCBA applied to the\ncompany concerned. RSU members are chosen by workers through an election\nprocess. RSA and RSU do not feature any significant differences in terms of\nactivities or powers. Their role is the same: negotiating company-level\ncollective agreements with the employer, as well as participating in\ninformation and consultation practices.\n\n#### Regulation, composition, and competences of the bodies\n\n|\n\n**Regulation**\n\n|\n\n**Composition**\n\n|\n\n**Competences of the body**\n\n**Involved in company level collective bargaining?**\n\n|\n\n**Thresholds/rules when they need to/can be set up**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**RSA**\n\n|\n\nArticle 19 of the Workers\u2019 Statute\n\n|\n\nUnion representatives\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative  \n  \n**RSU**\n\n|\n\nSingle text on representation of 10 January 2014 (TU 2014)\n\n|\n\nWorkers\u2019 representatives\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative\n\n  \n  \nTrade unions, employers\u2019 organisations and public institutions play a key role\nin the governance of the employment relationship, working conditions and\nindustrial relations structures. They are interlocking parts in a multilevel\nsystem of governance that includes the European, national, sectoral, regional\n(provincial or local) and company levels. This section looks into the main\nactors and institutions and their role in Italy.\n\n## Public authorities involved in regulating working life\n\nPublic authorities are not so much involved in social dialogue at national\nlevel, but the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, the Ministry of\nEconomic development and local authorities are often required to facilitate\nsocial dialogue at company level in case of company crisis (that is,\ncollective agreements signed in the case of collective dismissals or related\nto workers\u2019 income support measures). In some rare and particular cases (that\nis, leading businesses or partly state-owned companies), the government itself\ntries to foster, mediate, and support social dialogue.\n\nAnother important actor is the National Agency for Active Labour Market\nPolicies (ANPAL). ANPAL is supposed to perform a range of tasks: coordination\nof the network of services for labour policies; monitoring and evaluation;\ndefinition of service standards for employment services; definition of\nprofiling methodologies; and management of the network of vocational education\nand training (VET) providers and of the organisations that will be involved in\nimplementing ALMPs. Moreover, ANPAL coordinates programmes, also funded\nthrough EU resources, aimed at promoting employability.\n\n## Representativeness\n\nCriteria to define social partners\u2019 representativeness have been modified\nseveral times over the years. The first and only provision, until 1970, was\ncontained in Article 39 of the Italian Constitution, which sets forth a single\ncriterion based on the number of associates. Pursuant to the 1970 Workers\u2019\nStatute, trade unions that participate in the negotiations of the collective\nagreements applied in the workplace can set up trade union workplace\nrepresentation structures ( _Rappresentanze sindacali aziendali_ , RSA), which\nconsist of union delegates in companies with more than 15 employees, in the\nindustry or service sectors.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding signed on 3 July 1993 ( _Protocollo d\u2019Intesa_\n, PI 1993, in Italian, 95 KB DOC), which was entered into by social partners\nand the government, set out that RSU can be set up by workers by means of\nelections and in lieu of RSA.\n\nOn 14 January 2014, Confindustria, CGIL, CISL, and UIL signed a new cross-\nsectoral agreement (TU 2014) whereby new rules on representativeness were\nestablished. In particular, according to TU 2014, in order to participate in\nnational collective bargaining, trade unions must reach a representativeness\nthreshold of 5% measured as the average of the percentage of union members and\nof the votes obtained by the same unions in RSU elections. NCBAs are binding\nif signed by trade unions reaching a representativeness level of 50% +1 and if\napproved by the majority of workers through a referendum.\n\nMoreover, TU 2014 states that firm-level agreements are binding if signed by\nthe majority of RSU members or by the RSA receiving the majority of proxies\nfrom employees.\n\nMore information on representativeness of the main social partner\norganisations can be found in Eurofound\u2019s representativeness study of the\ncross-industry social partners or in Eurofound\u2019s sectoral representativeness\nstudies.\n\n## Trade unions\n\n#### About trade union representation\n\nEmployees enjoy the constitutionally enshrined right to organise unions and to\nstrike. Labour unions are usually set up on an industry or trade-wide basis,\nwith the various local unions forming a national body. NCBAs are implemented\nby employers\u2019 associations and unions and are legally binding only upon\nemployers and employees either belonging to the organisations that have signed\nthem, or that have chosen to adopt them. A de facto extension of such\ncollective bargaining is set out by labour courts. If the company is staffed\nwith more than 15 employees, they have the right to organise RSA or RSU.\nEither type of council can exercise the right to be informed and consulted\nmainly in the following cases: collective dismissal, business transfer, in\ncase the company intends to install work or personal control devices directly\ninvolving employees, or in any other case provided for by the relevant NCBA.\nArticle 39 of the Italian Constitution states that \u2018trade unions may be freely\nestablished\u2019 without restrictions or limitations. This, jointly with Article\n18 of the Italian Constitution (\u2018Citizens have the right to form associations\nfreely [\u2026] for those ends that are not forbidden by criminal law\u2019) confers\nupon workers wide freedom of union association.\n\n#### Trade union membership and trade union density\n\n|\n\n**2010**\n\n|\n\n**2011**\n\n|\n\n**2012**\n\n|\n\n**2013**\n\n|\n\n**2014**\n\n|\n\n2015\n\n|\n\n**Source**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Trade union density in terms of active employees**\n\n|\n\n35.5\n\n|\n\n35.7\n\n|\n\n36.3\n\n|\n\n36.9\n\n|\n\n36.4\n\n|\n\n35.7\n\n|\n\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on administrative data on member released by the\nthree main union confederations.  \n  \n**Trade union membership in 1000s**\n\n|\n\n100.9\n\n|\n\n102.1\n\n|\n\n103.5\n\n|\n\n102.7\n\n|\n\n100.5\n\n|\n\n99.8\n\n|\n\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on Istat, Migration and calculation of yearly\nresident population (2011-2013), Intercensual register population estimates\n(2010).  \n  \n#### Main trade union confederations and federations*\n\n**Long name**\n\n|\n\n**Abbreviation**\n\n|\n\n**Members**\n\n|\n\n**Involved in collective bargaining**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Italian General Confederation of Work (Confederazione Generale Italiana del\nLavoro)**\n\n|\n\nCGIL\n\n|\n\n2,772,928 (active workers) 518,774\n\n2,745,846 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Confederation of Workers\u2019 Unions (Confederazione Italiana Sindacati\nLavoratori)**\n\n|\n\nCISL\n\n|\n\n2,329,085 (active workers)\n\n1,711,738 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Union of Italian Workers (Unione Italiana del Lavoro)**\n\n|\n\nUIL\n\n|\n\n1,682,983 (active workers)\n\n573,091 (retired workers) (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Pensioners\u2019 Union (Sindacato Pensionati Italiani)**\n\n|\n\nSPI-CGIL\n\n|\n\n2,745,846 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Federation of Workers in the Trade, Tourism, and Service Sectors\n(Federazione Italiana Lavoratori Commercio, Turismo e Servizi)**\n\n|\n\nFILCAMS-CGIL\n\n|\n\n578,410 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**CGIL Public Employment Union (CGIL Funzione Pubblica)**\n\n|\n\nFP-CGIL\n\n|\n\n380,568 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**National Pensioners\u2019 Federation (Federazione Nazionale Pensionati)**\n\n|\n\nFNP-CISL\n\n|\n\n1,711,738 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Tourism, Trade Service,\nand Related Sectors (Federazione Italiana Sindacati Addetti Servizi\nCommerciali, Affini e del Turismo)**\n\n|\n\nFISASCAT-CISL\n\n|\n\n366,899 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**CISL Public Employment Union (CISL Funzione Pubblica)**\n\n|\n\nCISL FP\n\n|\n\n244,705 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**Italian Union of Retired Workers (Unione Italiana Lavoratori Pensionati)**\n\n|\n\nUILPENSIONATI\n\n|\n\n573,091 (2017)\n\n|\n\nNo  \n  \n**Italian Union of Agrifood Occupations (Unione Italiana dei Lavori\nAgroalimentari)**\n\n|\n\nUILA\n\n|\n\n226,551 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n**UIL Federation of Local Authorities and Health (UIL Federazione Poteri\nLocali)**\n\n|\n\nUIL FPL\n\n|\n\n204,964 (2017)\n\n|\n\nYes  \n  \n_Notes: * Please note that data on trade union membership are not official or\nformally certified, as they are not validated by independent authorities.

No. 99).\n\nCNEL is managed by 64 board members, nominated every five years. Specifically,\n10 members are appointed directly by the President of the Republic: two being\nproposed by the President of the Council of Ministries, while the others are\nnominated by the President of the Republic following a consultation procedure\nwhere social partners and non-governmental organisations propose board members\nwithin the respective quotas.\n\nCNEL has the right to initiate legislation and it carries out many important\nfunctions such as drafting reports, opinions and surveys upon request of\nParliament, Government or Regions on draft acts or on relevant issues\nconcerning economic and social policies. Furthermore, CNEL manages,\nimplements, and updates the National Archives of bargaining agreements.\n\nJoint union-employer bodies ( _enti bilaterali_ ) are set up jointly by\nemployers and trade unions with the aim of providing their members with\nwelfare and services. These institutions have become increasingly important in\nrecent years. There are several types of joint bodies, and they can be\nestablished by employers\u2019 associations and trade unions at cross-sectoral or\nsectoral level. They are managed jointly by social partners, and have an\ninternal organisational structure consisting of an assembly, an executive\nboard, a president, an executive director, and a monitoring committee. These\nadministrative bodies are usually appointed by social partners every three or\nfour years. Joint bodies deal with several issues, such as wages, skills,\ntraining, working time, and unemployment scheme benefits. They can be\nclassified into institutional funds and non-institutional funds.\n\nThey can be considered as institutional funds inasmuch as the law sets out\nspecific goals for collective bargaining to be pursued through funds, or\nalternatively specific schemes to be implemented through them; this category\nincludes pension funds, private healthcare funds, unemployment funds, and\nvocational training funds. Non-institutional funds are those that pursue goals\nor implement schemes that are self-regulated by collective bargaining.\n\n#### Main tripartite and bipartite

representation co-exist in Italy: RSA\nand RSU. RSA are established at company level at the workers\u2019 initiative\nwithin those trade unions that signed the NCBA applied in the company\nconcerned, as provided for by the Workers\u2019 Statute. According to TU 2014, RSU\nare established by the trade unions that signed the cross-sectoral agreements\ndated 28 June 2011 (in Italian, 1002 KB PDF) and 31 May 2013 (in Italian, 266\nKB PDF), as well as by the trade unions that signed the NCBA applied to the\ncompany concerned. RSU members are chosen by workers through an election\nprocess. RSA and RSU do not feature any significant differences in terms of\nactivities or powers. Their role is the same: negotiating company-level\ncollective agreements with the employer, as well as participating in\ninformation and consultation practices.\n\n#### Regulation, composition, and competences of the bodies\n\n|\n\n**Regulation**\n\n|\n\n**Composition**\n\n|\n\n**Competences of the body**\n\n**Involved in company level collective bargaining?**\n\n|\n\n**Thresholds/rules when they need to/can be set up**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**RSA**\n\n|\n\nArticle 19 of the Workers\u2019 Statute\n\n|\n\nUnion representatives\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative  \n  \n**RSU**\n\n|\n\nSingle text on representation of 10 January 2014 (TU 2014)\n\n|\n\nWorkers\u2019 representatives\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative\n\n  \n  \nTrade unions, employers\u2019 organisations and public institutions play a key role\nin the governance of the employment relationship, working conditions and\nindustrial relations structures. They are interlocking parts in a multilevel\nsystem of governance that includes the European, national, sectoral, regional\n(provincial or local) and company levels. This section looks into the main\nactors and institutions and their role in Italy.\nPublic authorities are not so much involved in social dialogue at national\nlevel, but the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, the Ministry of\nEconomic development and local authorities are often required to facilitate\nsocial dialogue at company level in case of company crisis (that is,\ncollective agreements signed in the case of collective dismissals or related\nto workers\u2019 income support measures). In some rare and particular cases (that\nis, leading businesses or partly state-owned companies), the government itself\ntries to foster, mediate, and support social dialogue.\nAnother important actor is the National Agency for Active Labour Market\nPolicies (ANPAL). ANPAL is supposed to perform a range of tasks: coordination\nof the network of services for labour policies; monitoring and evaluation;\ndefinition of service standards for employment services; definition of\nprofiling methodologies; and management of the network of vocational education\nand training (VET) providers and of the organisations that will be involved in\nimplementing ALMPs. Moreover, ANPAL coordinates programmes, also funded\nthrough EU resources, aimed at promoting employability.\nCriteria to define social partners\u2019 representativeness have been modified\nseveral times over the years. The first and only provision, until 1970, was\ncontained in Article 39 of the Italian Constitution, which sets forth a single\ncriterion based on the number of associates. Pursuant to the 1970 Workers\u2019\nStatute, trade unions that participate in the negotiations of the collective\nagreements applied in the workplace can set up trade union workplace\nrepresentation structures ( _Rappresentanze sindacali aziendali_ , RSA), which\nconsist of union delegates in companies with more than 15 employees, in the\nindustry or service sectors.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding signed on 3 July 1993 ( _Protocollo d\u2019Intesa_\n, PI 1993, in Italian, 95 KB DOC), which was entered into by social partners\nand the government, set out that RSU can be set up by workers by means of\nelections and in lieu of RSA.\nOn 14 January 2014, Confindustria, CGIL, CISL, and UIL signed a new cross-\nsectoral agreement (TU 2014) whereby new rules on representativeness were\nestablished. In particular, according to TU 2014, in order to participate in\nnational collective bargaining, trade unions must reach a representativeness\nthreshold of 5% measured as the average of the percentage of union members and\nof the votes obtained by the same unions in RSU elections. NCBAs are binding\nif signed by trade unions reaching a representativeness level of 50% +1 and if\napproved by the majority of workers through a referendum.\nMoreover, TU 2014 states that firm-level agreements are binding if signed by\nthe majority of RSU members or by the RSA receiving the majority of proxies\nfrom employees.\nMore information on representativeness of the main social partner\norganisations can be found in Eurofound\u2019s representativeness study of the\ncross-industry social partners or in Eurofound\u2019s sectoral representativeness\nstudies.\nEmployees enjoy the constitutionally enshrined right to organise unions and to\nstrike. Labour unions are usually set up on an industry or trade-wide basis,\nwith the various local unions forming a national body. NCBAs are implemented\nby employers\u2019 associations and unions and are legally binding only upon\nemployers and employees either belonging to the organisations that have signed\nthem, or that have chosen to adopt them. A de facto extension of such\ncollective bargaining is set out by labour courts. If the company is staffed\nwith more than 15 employees, they have the right to organise RSA or RSU.\nEither type of council can exercise the right to be informed and consulted\nmainly in the following cases: collective dismissal, business transfer, in\ncase the company intends to install work or personal control devices directly\ninvolving employees, or in any other case provided for by the relevant NCBA.\nArticle 39 of the Italian Constitution states that \u2018trade unions may be freely\nestablished\u2019 without restrictions or limitations. This, jointly with Article\n18 of the Italian Constitution (\u2018Citizens have the right to form associations\nfreely [\u2026] for those ends that are not forbidden by criminal law\u2019) confers\nupon workers wide freedom of union association.\n **2010**\n **2011**\n **2012**\n **2013**\n **2014**\n2015\n **Source**\n **Trade union density in terms of active employees**\n35.5\n35.7\n36.3\n36.9\n36.4\n35.7\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on administrative data on member released by the\nthree main union confederations.\n **Trade union membership in 1000s**\n100.9\n102.1\n103.5\n102.7\n100.5\n99.8\nOECD/Visser (2014), based on Istat, Migration and calculation of yearly\nresident population (2011-2013), Intercensual register population estimates\n(2010).\n **Long name**\n **Abbreviation**\n **Members**\n **Involved in collective bargaining**\n **Italian General Confederation of Work (Confederazione Generale Italiana del\nLavoro)**\nCGIL\n2,772,928 (active workers) 518,774\n2,745,846 (retired workers) (2017)\nYes\n **Italian Confederation of Workers\u2019 Unions (Confederazione Italiana Sindacati\nLavoratori)**\nCISL\n2,329,085 (active workers)\n1,711,738 (retired workers) (2017)\nYes\n **Union of Italian Workers (Unione Italiana del Lavoro)**\nUIL\n1,682,983 (active workers)\n573,091 (retired workers) (2017)\nYes\n **Italian Pensioners\u2019 Union (Sindacato Pensionati Italiani)**\nSPI-CGIL\n2,745,846 (2017)\nNo\n **Italian Federation of Workers in the Trade, Tourism, and Service Sectors\n(Federazione Italiana Lavoratori Commercio, Turismo e Servizi)**\nFILCAMS-CGIL\n578,410 (2017)\nYes\n **CGIL Public Employment Union (CGIL Funzione Pubblica)**\nFP-CGIL\n380,568 (2017)\nYes\n **National Pensioners\u2019 Federation (Federazione Nazionale Pensionati)**\nFNP-CISL\n1,711,738 (2017)\nNo\n **Italian Federation of Trade Unions of Workers in the Tourism, Trade\nService, and Related Sectors (Federazione Italiana Sindacati Addetti Servizi\nCommerciali, Affini e del Turismo)**\nFISASCAT-CISL\n366,899 (2017)\nYes\n **CISL Public Employment Union (CISL Funzione Pubblica)**\nCISL FP\n244,705 (2017)\nYes\n **Italian Union of Retired Workers (Unione Italiana Lavoratori Pensionati)**\nUILPENSIONATI\n573,091 (2017)\nNo\n **Italian Union of Agrifood Occupations (Unione Italiana dei Lavori\nAgroalimentari)**\nUILA\n226,551 (2017)\nYes\n **UIL Federation of Local Authorities and Health (UIL Federazione Poteri\nLocali)**\nUIL FPL\n204,964 (2017)\nYes\n _Notes: * Please note that data on trade union membership are not official or\nformally certified, as they are not validated by independent authorities.

These\nadministrative bodies are usually appointed by social partners every three or\nfour years. Joint bodies deal with several issues, such as wages, skills,\ntraining, working time, and unemployment scheme benefits. They can be\nclassified into institutional funds and non-institutional funds.\nThey can be considered as institutional funds inasmuch as the law sets out\nspecific goals for collective bargaining to be pursued through funds, or\nalternatively specific schemes to be implemented through them; this category\nincludes pension funds, private healthcare funds, unemployment funds, and\nvocational training funds. Non-institutional funds are those that pursue goals\nor implement schemes that are self-regulated by collective bargaining.\n **Name**\n **Type**\n **Level**\n **Issues covered**\n **National Council

types of workplace-level representation co-exist in Italy: RSA\nand RSU. RSA are established at company level at the workers\u2019 initiative\nwithin those trade unions that signed the NCBA applied in the company\nconcerned, as provided for by the Workers\u2019 Statute. According to TU 2014, RSU\nare established by the trade unions that signed the cross-sectoral agreements\ndated 28 June 2011 (in Italian, 1002 KB PDF) and 31 May 2013 (in Italian, 266\nKB PDF), as well as by the trade unions that signed the NCBA applied to the\ncompany concerned. RSU members are chosen by workers through an election\nprocess. RSA and RSU do not feature any significant differences in terms of\nactivities or powers. Their role is the same: negotiating company-level\ncollective agreements with the employer, as well as participating in\ninformation and consultation practices.\n **Regulation**\n **Composition**\n **Competences of the body**\n **Involved in company level collective bargaining?**\n **Thresholds/rules when they need to/can be set up**\n **RSA**\nArticle 19 of the Workers\u2019 Statute\nUnion representatives\nYes\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative\n **RSU**\nSingle text on representation of 10 January 2014 (TU 2014)\nWorkers\u2019 representatives\nYes\nSet up at the workers\u2019 initiative\nCollective bargaining\n\n## Bargaining system\n\nIn Italy, NCBAs are legally binding only upon employers and employees\nbelonging to the organisations that have signed them, or that choose to adopt\nthem. However, a de facto extension is set out by labour courts. Italian\ncollective bargaining is basically structured on two different levels;\nsectoral NCBAs are concluded for the whole Italian territory and applied to\nall employees of the same sector. At this level, the main items of the\nemployment contract are established, such as minimum wage, working time, job\nclassification, and working conditions. Certain specific aspects of work, such\nas incentive remuneration schemes, performance bonuses, productivity\nstandards, and special types of indemnities, are regulated at decentralised\nlevel (territorial - regional or provincial level - or company level). Act no.\n232/2016 (hereinafter \u20182017 Budget Law\u2019) sought to strengthen these elements.\nMoreover, this act boosts the incentives to encourage company welfare schemes\nto increase the number of beneficiaries among workers, as well as to extend\nproductivity bonuses.\n\n#### Wage bargaining coverage\n\nThe coverage of NCBAs can be cross-sectoral, sectoral, or related to specific\noccupations within one or more sectors, depending on the level of negotiations\nadopted by social partners.\n\nDecentralised second-level bargaining takes mostly place at company/workplace\nlevel, in the private manufacturing and service sectors as well as in the\npublic administration. However, in some sectors, decentralised agreements are\nconcluded at territorial level. In the construction sector, second-level\nbargaining takes place at provincial level and the same applies to agriculture\nand tourism; in the artisanal sector, decentralised agreements are negotiated\nat regional level.\n\n#### Collective wage bargaining coverage of employees at different levels\n\n**Level**\n\n|  |\n\n**Source**  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**All levels**\n\n|\n\n**97%**\n\n|\n\nEurofound (2013), _European Company Survey 2013 (ECS); private-sector\ncompanies with establishments >10 employees (NACE B\u2013S); multiple answers\npossible_  \n  \n**All, excluding the national level**\n\n|\n\n**37%**\n\n|\n\nEurofound (2013)  \n  \n**All levels**\n\n|\n\n**99.9%**\n\n|\n\nEurostat (2010), _Structure of Earnings Survey (SES); companies >10 employees\n(NACE B\u2013S); single answer: more than 50% of employees covered by such an\nagreement_  \n  \n_Please note that there is no clear distinction between national cross-\nsectoral, occupational, and sectoral levels in Italy. All these levels fall\nwithin the domain of NCBAs, which can cover a larger or smaller number of\nsectors and occupations. Decentralised bargaining can take place also at\nregional or company level. Thus, \u2018sectoral\u2019 and \u2018regional\u2019 refer to two\ndifferent levels of negotiations, whereas companies being covered by a\ncompany-level agreement are usually covered by an NCBA as well._\n\n#### Bargaining levels\n\nIn terms of setting pay, the most important level is, without any doubt, the\nsectoral one. As already stated, NCBAs set the minimum hourly wage and the\nmaximum length of the working day, depending on the sector and the type of\nactivity carried out. Some aspects of the remuneration structure and working\ntime management, such as incentive plans, fringe benefits, and overtime\nremuneration, are delegated to decentralised-level agreements. To sum up,\nbasic rights and pay levels are established at national level, while\ndecentralised collective agreements aim to adapt the general conditions to a\nspecific context, in accordance with the mandatory provisions established at\nnational level.\n\nDespite this general framework, the Budget Law 2017 established a new set of\nrules on contractual welfare schemes.\n\nDecentralised collective bargaining agreements set the framework for\ncontractual welfare from 2017 onwards, which will consist of:\n\n  * welfare schemes set directly at corporate level;\n  * welfare schemes managed through bilateral funds.\n\n#### Levels of collective bargaining 2016\n\n|\n\n**National level (intersectoral)**\n\n|\n\n**Sectoral level**\n\n|\n\n**Company level**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n|\n\n**Wages**\n\n|\n\n**Working time**\n\n|\n\n**Wages**\n\n|\n\n**Working time**\n\n|\n\n**Wages**\n\n|\n\n**Working time**  \n  \n**Principal or dominant level**\n\n|  |  |\n\nx\n\n|\n\nx\n\n|  |  \n  \n**Important but not dominant level**\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nx\n\n|\n\nx  \n  \n**Existing level**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  \n  \nNote: the Italian interconfederal level ( _livello interconfederale_ ) does\nnot address individual employment relationship but defines the rules governing\ncollective bargaining and some general issues, such as apprenticeships. It\nprovides the rules on the coordination between the sectoral and the\ndecentralised bargaining levels and it establishes the general reference\ncriteria for wage bargaining, including for the protection of the purchasing\npower of wages.\n\n#### Articulation\n\nAccording to TU 2014, decentralised collective agreements should concern only\nthe issues delegated by NCBAs. Basic rights and pay levels are established at\nsectoral level, while decentralised collective agreements aim to adapt the\ngeneral conditions to a specific context, in accordance with the mandatory\nprovisions set out at sectoral level.\n\n#### Timing of the bargaining rounds\n\nNCBAs are generally renewed every three years, while wages are adjusted to\ninflation every year. Decentralised (firm-level/regional) collective\nagreements have variable durations, but renewals tend to follow the timing of\nsectoral deals, while avoiding the overlap of negotiations. Agreements\nconcerning productivity standards and productivity bonuses tend to be renewed\nevery year, at least to revise the variable objectives.\n\nOn the basis of what is laid down by TU 2014 to avoid situations of excessive\nprolongation of bargaining rounds, social partners agreed that the proposals\nfor renewal must be submitted six months before the expiry of the NCBA.\n\n#### Coordination\n\nA vertical coordination mechanism is in place in the Italian bargaining\nsystem: national sectoral collective agreements regulate wages in line with\nthe provisions the Inter-confederal Agreement of January 2009. Opening clauses\nmay be present and they are managed by the national bargaining parties.\n\n#### Extension mechanisms\n\nCollective agreements cannot be extended by legislation. Employers can apply a\ncollective agreement, even though they are not a member of the employers\u2019\nassociation that signed it. Employers\u2019 associations and trade unions can join\na collective agreement even though they have not agreed upon it.\n\nFurthermore, Italy has never had legislation setting up a national minimum\nwage. The only law which regulates the remuneration of employees is included\nin the in Italian Civil Code, Art. No. 2099 and in the Italian Constitution\n(Art.36).\n\nNCBAs provide for a minimum wage for employees in the sector they refer to.\nHowever, these agreements apply only to enterprises and workers who are\nmembers of bargaining social partners. Section 36 of the Italian Constitution\nstates that workers are entitled to remuneration commensurate with their work\nand in any case such as to ensure them and their families a decent existence.\nThe Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) stated that only wages\nestablished in NCBAs signed by the most representative social partners met the\nrequirements outlined in the Constitution. Wage provisions contained in NCBAs,\ntherefore, represent the criterion to assess wages set in individual\ncontracts. Workers can sue their employers in Labour Courts in order to gain\nthe wages established by NCBAs.\n\n#### Derogation mechanisms\n\nCollective agreements can provide for opening clauses. Opening clauses mean a\ndeviation from NCBA and/or law (TU 2014).\n\nEmployers who do not want to apply collective agreements signed by their\nemployers\u2019 association should step out of the relevant employers\u2019 association.\nThis opting out is exemplified by the Fiat Group, which left the Italian major\nemployers\u2019 organisation Federmeccanica in late 2011 and decided to establish a\nseparate and independent industrial relation system, with a group first-level\ncollective agreement.\n\n#### Expiry of collective agreements\n\nThe Framework Agreement signed on 22 January 2009 \u2013 AQ 2009 (PDF) \u2013 has\nadopted general rules with regard to the timing of contractual renewals. The\nNCBAs will be in effect for three years regarding legal aspects as well as\npay. If a collective agreement is not renewed on time, a specific economic\nbonus is awarded to workers. Sectoral collective agreements can also establish\nthe involvement of cross-sectoral social partners when sectoral social\npartners do not manage to agree upon the contractual renewal. Collective\nagreements cease to be effective on the date of termination. The parties can\ncontinue to apply them, but they are not obliged to do so, unless the ultra-\nactivity of specific provisions is expressly stated in the deal. In case of\nclauses of indefinite duration, each party to the agreement can recede from\nthe agreement, provided it gives due notice to the other party. The collective\nagreement will then stop to be effective after the declared termination date.\nHowever, the individual employment contracts to which the terminated agreement\napplied remain unaffected. The newly stipulated employment contracts will not\nbe covered by the terminated agreement.\n\n#### Peace clauses\n\nAlthough it is formally possible to call a strike during negotiations, social\npartners have autonomously regulated this issue, by establishing peace\nobligation periods and procedures in interconfederal and sectoral agreements,\nwhich cover the negotiation phase. Peace obligation clauses have only an\nobligatory effect, i.e. they cover just the parties of the contract (and not\nthe single workers). Some sectoral agreements also include mechanisms of\ndispute resolution related to industrial action and disputes.\n## Bargaining system\n\nIn Italy, NCBAs are legally binding only upon employers and employees\nbelonging to the organisations that have signed them, or that choose to adopt\nthem.

To sum up,\nbasic rights and pay levels are established at national level, while\ndecentralised collective agreements aim to adapt the general conditions to a\nspecific context, in accordance with the mandatory provisions established at\nnational level.\nDespite this general framework, the Budget Law 2017 established a new set of\nrules on contractual welfare schemes.\nDecentralised collective bargaining agreements set the framework for\ncontractual welfare from 2017 onwards, which will consist of:\n **National level (intersectoral)**\n **Sectoral level**\n **Company level**\n **Wages**\n **Working time**\n **Wages**\n **Working time**\n **Wages**\n **Working time**\n **Principal or dominant level**\nx\nx\n **Important but not dominant level**\nx\nx\n **Existing level**\nNote: the Italian interconfederal level ( _livello interconfederale_ ) does\nnot address individual employment relationship but defines the rules governing\ncollective bargaining and some general issues, such as apprenticeships. It\nprovides the rules on the coordination between the sectoral and the\ndecentralised bargaining levels and it establishes the general reference\ncriteria for wage bargaining, including for the protection of the purchasing\npower of wages.\nAccording to TU 2014, decentralised collective agreements should concern only\nthe issues delegated by NCBAs. Basic rights and pay levels are established at\nsectoral level, while decentralised collective agreements aim to adapt the\ngeneral conditions to a specific context, in accordance with the mandatory\nprovisions set out at sectoral level.\nNCBAs are generally renewed every three years, while wages are adjusted to\ninflation every year. Decentralised (firm-level/regional) collective\nagreements have variable durations, but renewals tend to follow the timing of\nsectoral deals, while avoiding the overlap of negotiations. Agreements\nconcerning productivity standards and productivity bonuses tend to be renewed\nevery year, at least to revise the variable objectives.\nOn the basis of what is laid down by TU 2014 to avoid situations of excessive\nprolongation of bargaining rounds, social partners agreed that the proposals\nfor renewal must be submitted six months before the expiry of the NCBA.\nA vertical coordination mechanism is in place in the Italian bargaining\nsystem: national sectoral collective agreements regulate wages in line with\nthe provisions the Inter-confederal Agreement of January 2009. Opening clauses\nmay be present and they are managed by the national bargaining parties.\nCollective agreements cannot be extended by legislation. Employers can apply a\ncollective agreement, even though they are not a member of the employers\u2019\nassociation that signed it. Employers\u2019 associations and trade unions can join\na collective agreement even though they have not agreed upon it.\nFurthermore, Italy has never had legislation setting up a national minimum\nwage. The only law which regulates the remuneration of employees is included\nin the in Italian Civil Code, Art. No. 2099 and in the Italian Constitution\n(Art.36).\nNCBAs provide for a minimum wage for employees in the sector they refer to.\nHowever, these agreements apply only to enterprises and workers who are\nmembers of bargaining social partners. Section 36 of the Italian Constitution\nstates that workers are entitled to remuneration commensurate with their work\nand in any case such as to ensure them and their families a decent existence.\nThe Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) stated that only wages\nestablished in NCBAs signed by the most representative social partners met the\nrequirements outlined in the Constitution. Wage provisions contained in NCBAs,\ntherefore, represent the criterion to assess wages set in individual\ncontracts. Workers can sue their employers in Labour Courts in order to gain\nthe wages established by NCBAs.\nCollective agreements can provide for opening clauses. Opening clauses mean a\ndeviation from NCBA and/or law (TU 2014).\nEmployers who do not want to apply collective agreements signed by their\nemployers\u2019 association should step out of the relevant employers\u2019 association.\nThis opting out is exemplified by the Fiat Group, which left the Italian major\nemployers\u2019 organisation Federmeccanica in late 2011 and decided to establish a\nseparate and independent industrial relation system, with a group first-level\ncollective agreement.\nThe Framework Agreement signed on 22 January 2009 \u2013 AQ 2009 (PDF) \u2013 has\nadopted general rules with regard to the timing of contractual renewals. The\nNCBAs will be in effect for three years regarding legal aspects as well as\npay. If a collective agreement is not renewed on time, a specific economic\nbonus is awarded to workers. Sectoral collective agreements can also establish\nthe involvement of cross-sectoral social partners when sectoral social\npartners do not manage to agree upon the contractual renewal. Collective\nagreements cease to be effective on the date of termination. The parties can\ncontinue to apply them, but they are not obliged to do so, unless the ultra-\nactivity of specific provisions is expressly stated in the deal. In case of\nclauses of indefinite duration, each party to the agreement can recede from\nthe agreement, provided it gives due notice to the other party. The collective\nagreement will then stop to be effective after the declared termination date.\nHowever, the individual employment contracts to which the terminated agreement\napplied remain unaffected. The newly stipulated employment contracts will not\nbe covered by the terminated agreement.\nAlthough it is formally possible to call a strike during negotiations, social\npartners have autonomously regulated this issue, by establishing peace\nobligation periods and procedures in interconfederal and sectoral agreements,\nwhich cover the negotiation phase. Peace obligation clauses have only an\nobligatory effect, i.e. they cover just the parties of the contract (and not\nthe single workers). Some sectoral agreements also include mechanisms of\ndispute resolution related to industrial action and disputes.\nIndustrial action and disputes\n\n## Legal aspects\n\nThe right to strike is enshrined in Article 40 of the Italian Constitution.\n\nThe law regulates the right to strike only in relation to essential public\nservices, irrespective if they are provided by the public administration or\nprivate enterprises. In practice, essential public services are those which\nensure constitutionally protected rights (such as education, health, public\nsafety, mobility) or public order and public interests. They include, for\ninstance, local transport, emergency services, hospitals, firefighters,\ninfrastructure workers, final school examinations, and so forth. The general\ncriteria are that minimum services must be ensured in the event of a strike in\nthese services, in order to balance the exercise of the right to strike and\nthe other protected rights or interests. The minimum services can be\nestablished by collective agreements or law. There is a special guarantee\ncommission for the application of the law on the right to strike in public\nessential services ( _Commissione di garanzia dell\u00b4attuazione della legge\nsullo sciopero nei servizi pubblici essenziali_ ).\n\nIn all other cases, two requirements shall be met for a strike to be\nconsidered lawful:\n\n  1. the interruption of the working activity is organised on a collective basis, and is promoted by a trade union; and\n  2. the industrial action takes place on a voluntary basis.\n\nNo further limitations exist in relation to the right to strike.\n\nIt is possible to distinguish between two different types of strike:\n\n  1. a strike for contractual purposes, obviously aimed at obtaining better contractual working conditions;\n  2. a strike for political purposes, aimed at persuading public authorities to adopt some specific actions.\n\nLockout (i.e. the decision made by the employer to prevent workers\u2019 access to\nthe workplace and thus their working activity) is allowed in Italy, but it is\nconsidered a breach of the obligations set out in the employment contract.\n\n#### Industrial action developments\n\nThe publication of general and official data on strikes has been discontinued\nsince 2010.\n\n## Dispute resolution mechanisms\n\n#### Collective dispute resolution mechanisms\n\nSome collective agreements provide for dispute resolution committees,\nbilaterally managed by social partners. Collective agreements do not set out\nspecific procedures to be followed in order to settle a dispute in front of\nthese committees, which are in charge of ensuring the application of\ncollectively agreed provisions.\n\nGenerally, the majority of labour disputes end up in labour courts.\n## Legal aspects\n\nThe right to strike is enshrined in Article 40 of the Italian Constitution.\n\nThe law regulates the right to strike only in relation to essential public\nservices, irrespective if they are provided by the public administration or\nprivate enterprises.

Collective agreements do not set out\nspecific procedures to be followed in order to settle a dispute in front of\nthese committees, which are in charge of ensuring the application of\ncollectively agreed provisions.\nGenerally, the majority of labour disputes end up in labour courts.\nIndividual employment relations\n\nIndividual employment relations are the relationship between the individual\nworker and their employer. This relationship is shaped by legal regulation and\nby the outcomes of social partner negotiations over the terms and conditions\ngoverning the employment relationship. This section looks into the start and\ntermination of the employment relationship and entitlements and obligations in\nItaly.\n\n## Start and termination of the employment relationship\n\n#### Requirements regarding an employment contract\n\nAccording to applicable legislation, the minimum working age is fixed at 16\nyears, except for apprenticeships for which it is fixed at 15 years. The\nwritten form is generally not required with regard to employment contracts\n(except in some cases, such as apprenticeships), but the employer is obliged\nto inform the worker in writing of applied working conditions. To be valid,\nthe employment contract has to be agreed upon by both parties. As a\nconsequence, where there is a relevant mistake about personal qualities and\nskills, the agreement cannot be considered valid.\n\n#### Dismissal and termination procedures\n\nThe provisions of the Italian Civil Code on individual dismissals were\nsubstantially modified by special laws (Act no. 604/1966, the Workers\u2019\nStatute, Act no. 108/1990, Act No. 92/2012 and by the latest labour market\nreform \u2013 the so-called \u2018Jobs Act\u2019).\n\nWith Jobs Act, a binary system has been created: on the one hand, the new\nregulation applies to new hires starting from March 2015. On the other hand,\nprevious regulations continue to be in force for workers already employed on\nindefinite contracts (employees still covered by law no. 92/2012).\n\n  * Individual dismissal for just cause ( _giusta causa_ ): under this scenario, the employee is dismissed because of his/her own misconduct, which \u2018makes the continuation of the employment relationship impossible\u2019 (Article 2119 of the Italian Civil Code).\n  * Individual dismissal for justified reason __ ( _giustificato motivo_ ): pursuant to Law No. 604/1966, _giustificato motivo_ is either a serious breach of the contract by the employee or \u2018any reason concerning productivity, work organisation, or the operation of the company\u2019 \u2013 that is, lack of productivity, continuous uncooperative attitude, or the cancellation of the position. In such cases, the employee is given notice of dismissal or receives the indemnity in lieu of notice.\n\nFor employees hired before March 2015, for dismissal without either _giusta\ncausa_ or _giustificato motivo_ found by the Court, two scenarios lie ahead:\n(i) employers having more than 15 employees within the same Municipality or\nmore than 60 employees on the Italian territory shall reinstate the employee\nin his/her job; they shall moreover pay back all monthly salaries related to\nthe period from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement, in\naddition to any damages that the employee may actually prove s/he has suffered\nas a consequence of the unlawful dismissal (that is, as of 2012, \u2018unlawful\ndismissal\u2019 means that such dismissal was based on discrimination and/or\nunreasonable disciplinary facts; burden of proof and litigation are required\nin order to activate this regime). The employee is entitled to the payment of\nan indemnity equal to a maximum of 24 monthly salary payments in the event of\ndismissal deemed to be wrongful; in other words, if it is not \u2018grounded\u2019 on\nobjective or subjective reasons: these occur when the dismissal is based on a\nfailure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s\ncompany premises, or other legitimate business reasons; (ii) employers staffed\nwith 15 or fewer employees can choose to rehire the employee or pay him/her an\nindemnity ranging from 2.5 to six months of his/her last salary. The amount of\nthe indemnity depends on the number of employees, the size of the company, the\nlength of the employment period, and the parties\u2019 behaviour.\n\nFor employees hired starting March 2015, law 23/2015 reformed this set of\nrules. In greater detail, it introduced a new protection regime against\nindividual and collective unlawful dismissals (so-called \u2018seniority-based\nprotection regime\u2019, _contratto a tutele crescenti_ ): starting on 7 March\n2015, the new employment relationships were affected by forms of protection\nincreasing with seniority in the case of unlawful dismissals. The new system\nwill concern not only workers (excluding managers) employed under indefinite\ncontracts, but also:\n\n  * employees belonging to companies whose workforce \u2013 as a consequence of new hires \u2013 exceeds 15 people within the same business unit or municipality (or exceeds 60 people in total);\n  * employees on fixed-term contracts converted into indefinite contracts after the entry into force of the new regulations;\n  * employees on apprenticeship contracts converted into indefinite contracts after the entry into force of the new regulations.\n\nDifferent remedies are introduced depending on the reasons for dismissal:\n\n  * seniority-based indemnities for economic dismissals: the employer shall no longer be sanctioned with the reinstatement of the employee in case of groundless dismissals for economic reasons. The sanction consists only of compensation for damages (i.e. two months\u2019 salary per year of service, with a minimum of six months and a maximum of 36 months \u2013 both limits have been increased by the 2018 \u2018dignity decree\u2019);\n  * seniority-based indemnities will also apply to unlawful dismissals based on justified subjective reasons and just cause. Reinstatement is to be implemented, together with an indemnity equal to the salary due from the date of dismissal until the reinstatement (up to 12 months), plus social security charges only if the facts causing the dismissal are proven non-existent;\n  * no \u2018grey areas\u2019 are envisaged regarding the right to reinstatement for discriminatory dismissals and other null and void dismissals: reinstatement \u2013 together with an indemnity equal to the salary due from the date of dismissal until the reinstatement (with a minimum of five months) \u2013 is to be implemented only in serious cases of unlawful dismissals, including dismissals that are solely verbal, dismissals based on discrimination or retaliation, and dismissals during maternity leave. Employees could alternatively choose an indemnity equal to 15 months\u2019 salary in lieu of reinstatement;\n  * dismissals affected by formal irregularities: a seniority-based indemnity is due, consisting of one month\u2019s salary per year of service, with a minimum of two and a maximum of 12 months.\n\nAt the end of September 2018, the Italian Constitutional Court declared\nunconstitutional the automatic determination of severance pay introduced by\nlaw 23/2015. According to the Consitutional Court, this automatic mechanism is\nunconstitutional because it links severance pay exclusively to seniority and\nthereby violates the principles of reasonability and equality and impedes the\nrights and protection of workers, as established by Articles 4 and 35 of the\nItalian Constitution.\n\nThe provisions contained in those laws concern in most aspects only workers (\n_operai_ ) and employees ( _impiegati_ ), and do not affect executives (\n_dirigenti_ ). These provisions substantially limit certain rights of the\nemployer.\n\nThe dismissal of executives is governed by __ Articles 2118 and 2119 of the\nItalian Civil Code, and by the relevant NCBA, if applicable. The dismissal of\nexecutives must be communicated in writing. Such dismissal is lawful if it\nbased on a just cause (see above) or if the dismissal is not wrongful, and\nthus it is fair and reasonable (that is, it is \u2018grounded\u2019 on objective or\nsubjective reasons). In general, the dismissal of an executive is considered\nlawful if the reason for employment termination relates to the executive\u2019s\nconduct damaging the trust and confidence relationship with the employer, or\nif it is attributable to the fact that the executive\u2019s activity is no longer\nrequired by the employer as a result of the reorganisation of the workforce or\nowing to company crisis. If the dismissal is based on a just cause, no notice\nperiod applies. In any other case of dismissal, the notice period provided for\nby the applicable NCBA, or the indemnity in lieu of notice applies. If the\ndismissal of the executive is not based on a just cause or is not grounded on\nobjective or subjective reasons (as mentioned above) and the employment\nrelationship is regulated by an NCBA, the executive is entitled to receive a\nspecial indemnity (so-called \u2018supplementary indemnity\u2019, _indennit\u00e0\nsupplementare_ ) set forth in the applicable NCBA (such an indemnity varies\nbased on the executive\u2019s length of service and age). On 30 December 2014, the\nNCBA applicable to executives in the industry sector was renewed, resulting in\na reduction of the notice periods (from six to 12 months depending on the\nlength of service) and of the minimum supplementary indemnity (two monthly\nsalary payments), as well as in an increase in the minimum length of service\nneeded to be entitled to the maximum level of supplementary indemnity (at\nleast 15 years, to be entitled to a 18\u201324 monthly wage range).\n\nDismissal of employees/executives is prohibited in the following cases:\n\n  * wedding of a female employee \u2013 from the date of publication of the wedding until one year after the ceremony (Article 1 of Act no. 7/1963) except for the cases specified by law;\n  * pregnancy of the employee \u2013 during the period of pregnancy and for the first year after delivery (Article 2 of Act no. 1204/1971);\n  * accidents at work or illness of the employee \u2013 for the term (so-called \u2018protected period\u2019) as specified by law or in the applicable NCBA (Article 2110 of the Italian Civil Code), unless a just cause for termination occurs;\n  * works council executives \u2013 for the period of assignment and until one year from the end thereof (Articles 18 and 22 of the Workers\u2019 Statute);\n  * dismissal for discriminatory reasons _\u2013_ such as political opinions, religion, race, language, sex, and trade union membership.\n\n## Entitlements and obligations\n\n#### Parental, maternity, and paternity leave\n\nPursuant to Act no. 151/2001, and subsequent amendments, an employee must be\nexempted from service during the last two months of pregnancy and the first\nthree months after childbirth or, at the choice of the employee, during the\nlast month of pregnancy and the first four months after childbirth. During\nsuch a compulsory absence, 80% of her salary is paid by INPS and 20% by the\nemployer. The employee may choose to stay at home for an additional six\nmonths; however, during this period, she is considered as an employee only for\nseniority purposes and is entitled to maintain her employment position;\nhowever, she receives only part of her salary (30%) from INPS.\n\nFrom the beginning of the pregnancy until the child is one year old, the\nemployee cannot be dismissed unless: a just cause for dismissal occurs; the\ncompany\u2019s activity is terminated; or the employment relationship comes to an\nend owing to the expiry of the agreed term.\n\nThe abovementioned provisions can be extended to the father of the child if:\nthe mother is dead or is affected by severe disabilities; the mother has\nabandoned the child; or the child has been entrusted exclusively to the\nfather\u2019s care.\n\nLaw No. 92/2012 established a mandatory paternity leave of one working day to\ntake care of the child and/or assist the mother. In addition, the decree on\nwork\u2013life balance (Legislative Decree 15 June 2015, No. 80) reforms the\nexisting work\u2013life reconciliation measures. The law provides for a time\nextension of parental leave, which could be used until the child\u2019s twelfth\nyear (instead of his/her eighth year, as set out in the previous legislation).\nThe partially paid (30%) parental leave is extended from the child\u2019s third\nyear of age to his/her sixth year, while the unpaid one from the sixth to the\ntwelfth year. Furthermore, this provision applies to parents with an\nindividual income lower than 2.5 times the monthly minimum pension scheme.\n\nA similar extension is introduced for cases of adoption or foster care, for\nwhich the possibility of taking parental leave shall start from the child\u2019s\nentrance into the family. It will also be possible to opt for a part-time\nworking arrangement instead of parental leave in case the staff structure\nprovides for part-time positions. Moreover, paternity leave is extended to all\ncategories of workers \u2013 not only to employees as it is now. In general terms,\nseveral changes have been made to parental and maternity leave. In conclusion,\nthe 2017 Budget Law sets out additional provisions. The most relevant are:\n\n  * Support Fund for Higher Birth-Rates ( _Fondo di sostegno alla natalit\u00e0_ ): this fund is aimed at promoting access to credit for families with one or more children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2017;\n  * childbirth bonus ( _bonus beb\u00e8_ ): this \u20ac800 lump sum is granted upon the birth or adoption of a child, and is paid by INPS in a single instalment following the ad hoc application to be filed by the future mother;\n  * Support Fund for Family Allowances ( _Fondo per l\u2019incremento degli assegni al nucleo familiare_ ): this fund is targeted at Italian citizens working in another EU Member State who have four or more children;\n  * cr\u00e8che and baby-sitting vouchers: the cr\u00e8che voucher is aimed at supporting the enrolment in public or private cr\u00e8ches, or alternatively at bolstering the introduction of support tools at home in the case of children below three years of age, affected by severe chronic diseases. The new provisions furthermore enable both employed and self-employed mothers to apply for a cr\u00e8che or baby-sitting voucher in lieu of parental leave (wholly or partially).\n\n#### Statutory leave arrangements\n\nMaternity leave  \n  \n---  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\nTwo months before and three months after delivery (or one month before and\nfour months after delivery). In some specific cases, additional months are\nenvisaged.  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n100% of basic remuneration (80% to be paid by INPS, and 20% by the employer)  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS (80% of basic remuneration) and employers (20%)  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct. no. 151/2001  \n  \nParental leave  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\n11 months (to be shared between the mother and the father)  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n30% of basic remuneration  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct no. 151/2001  \n  \nPaternity leave  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\nTwo days in 2017, and up to four days in 2018 (it can be raised up to five\ndays if the father replaces the mother in relation to the mandatory leave\nperiod).  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n100% anticipated by the employer and subsequently reimbursed by INPS, as\nprovided for by law in relation to maternity leave in general  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct no. 92/2012, Act no. 80/2015 (Jobs Act \u2013 work\u2013life balance, \u2018JABalance\u2019),\nand 2017 Budget Law  \n  \n#### Sick leave\n\nIn case of illness, the employee has the right to maintain his/her job during\nthe sick leave (so-called \u2018protected period\u2019) as set out in the relevant NCBA.\nDuring this period, the employer cannot dismiss the worker.\n\nIf sick, the employee must inform the employer as soon as possible, before the\nbeginning of his/her working day. Consequently, a doctor must certify the\nstate of illness, submitting the certificate to INPS through an online\nprocedure. INPS makes the certificate available for the employer.\n\nThe employee receives a special indemnity, calculated as 50% of basic\nremuneration from the fourth day to the 20thday of illness. From the 21st day\non, the indemnity amounts to 66.66% of basic remuneration.\n\n#### Retirement age\n\nAct no. 201/2011 radically reformed the Italian social security system,\nallowing for a yearly increase in the retirement age in order to adapt it to\nthe population\u2019s increasing life expectancy.\n\nIn the framework of measures addressing retirement rules and pension benefits,\nand following a long phase of consultations with trade unions, the 2017 Budget\nLaw introduced three early retirement schemes targeting people aged at least\n63 who are no more than three years and seven months away from statutory\nretirement age: the social advance pension payment ( _anticipo pensionistico\nsociale_ , special APe), the advance pension payment ( _anticipo\npensionistico_ , general APe), and the temporary supplementary advance annuity\n( _rendita integrativa temporanea anticipata_ , RITA). In greater detail,\nspecific categories of disadvantaged people will have the possibility to\naccess the special APE, which is funded by the State. The general APe can be\naccessed by other workers upon taking out a 20-year loan intended to pay back\nthe anticipated sum, as well as a life insurance policy subsidised by the\nState. Finally, workers enrolled in supplementary private pension schemes will\nhave the opportunity to apply for RITA, an advance pension payment subject to\na 15% maximum taxation rate.\n\nThe act also eliminated caps on the value of supplementary pension\ncontributions that can be exempted from income taxation, a measure that is\nlikely to promote the establishment of contractual pension funds in the\nframework of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe new coalition government between the Five Star Movement and the League\nwhich took office in mid-2018 introduced in early 2019 an anticipated\nretirement scheme, which will last for three years, for people whose age and\nyears of contribution add to 100 (the so called \u2018 _quota 100_ \u2019).\nIndividual employment relations are the relationship between the individual\nworker and their employer. This relationship is shaped by legal regulation and\nby the outcomes of social partner negotiations over the terms and conditions\ngoverning the employment relationship. This section looks into the start and\ntermination of the employment relationship and entitlements and obligations in\nItaly.\n\n## Start and termination of the employment relationship\n\n#### Requirements regarding an employment contract\n\nAccording to applicable legislation, the minimum working age is fixed at 16\nyears, except for apprenticeships for which it is fixed at 15 years. The\nwritten form is generally not required with regard to employment contracts\n(except in some cases, such as apprenticeships), but the employer is obliged\nto inform the worker in writing of applied working conditions. To be valid,\nthe employment contract has to be agreed upon by both parties. As a\nconsequence, where there is a relevant mistake about personal qualities and\nskills, the agreement cannot be considered valid.\n\n#### Dismissal and termination procedures\n\nThe provisions of the Italian Civil Code on individual dismissals were\nsubstantially modified by special laws (Act no. 604/1966, the Workers\u2019\nStatute, Act no. 108/1990, Act No. 92/2012 and by the latest labour market\nreform \u2013 the so-called \u2018Jobs Act\u2019).\n\nWith Jobs Act, a binary system has been created: on the one hand, the new\nregulation applies to new hires starting from March 2015. On the other hand,\nprevious regulations continue to be in force for workers already employed on\nindefinite contracts (employees still covered by law no. 92/2012).\n\n  * Individual dismissal for just cause ( _giusta causa_ ): under this scenario, the employee is dismissed because of his/her own misconduct, which \u2018makes the continuation of the employment relationship impossible\u2019 (Article 2119 of the Italian Civil Code).\n  * Individual dismissal for justified reason __ ( _giustificato motivo_ ): pursuant to Law No. 604/1966, _giustificato motivo_ is either a serious breach of the contract by the employee or \u2018any reason concerning productivity, work organisation, or the operation of the company\u2019 \u2013 that is, lack of productivity, continuous uncooperative attitude, or the cancellation of the position. In such cases, the employee is given notice of dismissal or receives the indemnity in lieu of notice.\n\nFor employees hired before March 2015, for dismissal without either _giusta\ncausa_ or _giustificato motivo_ found by the Court, two scenarios lie ahead:\n(i) employers having more than 15 employees within the same Municipality or\nmore than 60 employees on the Italian territory shall reinstate the employee\nin his/her job; they shall moreover pay back all monthly salaries related to\nthe period from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement, in\naddition to any damages that the employee may actually prove s/he has suffered\nas a consequence of the unlawful dismissal (that is, as of 2012, \u2018unlawful\ndismissal\u2019 means that such dismissal was based on discrimination and/or\nunreasonable disciplinary facts; burden of proof and litigation are required\nin order to activate this regime). The employee is entitled to the payment of\nan indemnity equal to a maximum of 24 monthly salary payments in the event of\ndismissal deemed to be wrongful; in other words, if it is not \u2018grounded\u2019 on\nobjective or subjective reasons: these occur when the dismissal is based on a\nfailure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s\ncompany premises, or other legitimate business reasons; (ii) employers staffed\nwith 15 or fewer employees can choose to rehire the employee or pay him/her an\nindemnity ranging from 2.5 to six months of his/her last salary. The amount of\nthe indemnity depends on the number of employees, the size of the company, the\nlength of the employment period, and the parties\u2019 behaviour.\n\nFor employees hired starting March 2015, law 23/2015 reformed this set of\nrules. In greater detail, it introduced a new protection regime against\nindividual and collective unlawful dismissals (so-called \u2018seniority-based\nprotection regime\u2019, _contratto a tutele crescenti_ ): starting on 7 March\n2015, the new employment relationships were affected by forms of protection\nincreasing with seniority in the case of unlawful dismissals. The new system\nwill concern not only workers (excluding managers) employed under indefinite\ncontracts, but also:\n\n  * employees belonging to companies whose workforce \u2013 as a consequence of new hires \u2013 exceeds 15 people within the same business unit or municipality (or exceeds 60 people in total);\n  * employees on fixed-term contracts converted into indefinite contracts after the entry into force of the new regulations;\n  * employees on apprenticeship contracts converted into indefinite contracts after the entry into force of the new regulations.\n\nDifferent remedies are introduced depending on the reasons for dismissal:\n\n  * seniority-based indemnities for economic dismissals: the employer shall no longer be sanctioned with the reinstatement of the employee in case of groundless dismissals for economic reasons. The sanction consists only of compensation for damages (i.e. two months\u2019 salary per year of service, with a minimum of six months and a maximum of 36 months \u2013 both limits have been increased by the 2018 \u2018dignity decree\u2019);\n  * seniority-based indemnities will also apply to unlawful dismissals based on justified subjective reasons and just cause. Reinstatement is to be implemented, together with an indemnity equal to the salary due from the date of dismissal until the reinstatement (up to 12 months), plus social security charges only if the facts causing the dismissal are proven non-existent;\n  * no \u2018grey areas\u2019 are envisaged regarding the right to reinstatement for discriminatory dismissals and other null and void dismissals: reinstatement \u2013 together with an indemnity equal to the salary due from the date of dismissal until the reinstatement (with a minimum of five months) \u2013 is to be implemented only in serious cases of unlawful dismissals, including dismissals that are solely verbal, dismissals based on discrimination or retaliation, and dismissals during maternity leave. Employees could alternatively choose an indemnity equal to 15 months\u2019 salary in lieu of reinstatement;\n  * dismissals affected by formal irregularities: a seniority-based indemnity is due, consisting of one month\u2019s salary per year of service, with a minimum of two and a maximum of 12 months.\n\nAt the end of September 2018, the Italian Constitutional Court declared\nunconstitutional the automatic determination of severance pay introduced by\nlaw 23/2015. According to the Consitutional Court, this automatic mechanism is\nunconstitutional because it links severance pay exclusively to seniority and\nthereby violates the principles of reasonability and equality and impedes the\nrights and protection of workers, as established by Articles 4 and 35 of the\nItalian Constitution.\n\nThe provisions contained in those laws concern in most aspects only workers (\n_operai_ ) and employees ( _impiegati_ ), and do not affect executives (\n_dirigenti_ ). These provisions substantially limit certain rights of the\nemployer.\n\nThe dismissal of executives is governed by __ Articles 2118 and 2119 of the\nItalian Civil Code, and by the relevant NCBA, if applicable. The dismissal of\nexecutives must be communicated in writing. Such dismissal is lawful if it\nbased on a just cause (see above) or if the dismissal is not wrongful, and\nthus it is fair and reasonable (that is, it is \u2018grounded\u2019 on objective or\nsubjective reasons). In general, the dismissal of an executive is considered\nlawful if the reason for employment termination relates to the executive\u2019s\nconduct damaging the trust and confidence relationship with the employer, or\nif it is attributable to the fact that the executive\u2019s activity is no longer\nrequired by the employer as a result of the reorganisation of the workforce or\nowing to company crisis. If the dismissal is based on a just cause, no notice\nperiod applies. In any other case of dismissal, the notice period provided for\nby the applicable NCBA, or the indemnity in lieu of notice applies. If the\ndismissal of the executive is not based on a just cause or is not grounded on\nobjective or subjective reasons (as mentioned above) and the employment\nrelationship is regulated by an NCBA, the executive is entitled to receive a\nspecial indemnity (so-called \u2018supplementary indemnity\u2019, _indennit\u00e0\nsupplementare_ ) set forth in the applicable NCBA (such an indemnity varies\nbased on the executive\u2019s length of service and age). On 30 December 2014, the\nNCBA applicable to executives in the industry sector was renewed, resulting in\na reduction of the notice periods (from six to 12 months depending on the\nlength of service) and of the minimum supplementary indemnity (two monthly\nsalary payments), as well as in an increase in the minimum length of service\nneeded to be entitled to the maximum level of supplementary indemnity (at\nleast 15 years, to be entitled to a 18\u201324 monthly wage range).\n\nDismissal of employees/executives is prohibited in the following cases:\n\n  * wedding of a female employee \u2013 from the date of publication of the wedding until one year after the ceremony (Article 1 of Act no. 7/1963) except for the cases specified by law;\n  * pregnancy of the employee \u2013 during the period of pregnancy and for the first year after delivery (Article 2 of Act no. 1204/1971);\n  * accidents at work or illness of the employee \u2013 for the term (so-called \u2018protected period\u2019) as specified by law or in the applicable NCBA (Article 2110 of the Italian Civil Code), unless a just cause for termination occurs;\n  * works council executives \u2013 for the period of assignment and until one year from the end thereof (Articles 18 and 22 of the Workers\u2019 Statute);\n  * dismissal for discriminatory reasons _\u2013_ such as political opinions, religion, race, language, sex, and trade union membership.\n\n## Entitlements and obligations\n\n#### Parental, maternity, and paternity leave\n\nPursuant to Act no. 151/2001, and subsequent amendments, an employee must be\nexempted from service during the last two months of pregnancy and the first\nthree months after childbirth or, at the choice of the employee, during the\nlast month of pregnancy and the first four months after childbirth. During\nsuch a compulsory absence, 80% of her salary is paid by INPS and 20% by the\nemployer. The employee may choose to stay at home for an additional six\nmonths; however, during this period, she is considered as an employee only for\nseniority purposes and is entitled to maintain her employment position;\nhowever, she receives only part of her salary (30%) from INPS.\n\nFrom the beginning of the pregnancy until the child is one year old, the\nemployee cannot be dismissed unless: a just cause for dismissal occurs; the\ncompany\u2019s activity is terminated; or the employment relationship comes to an\nend owing to the expiry of the agreed term.\n\nThe abovementioned provisions can be extended to the father of the child if:\nthe mother is dead or is affected by severe disabilities; the mother has\nabandoned the child; or the child has been entrusted exclusively to the\nfather\u2019s care.\n\nLaw No. 92/2012 established a mandatory paternity leave of one working day to\ntake care of the child and/or assist the mother. In addition, the decree on\nwork\u2013life balance (Legislative Decree 15 June 2015, No. 80) reforms the\nexisting work\u2013life reconciliation measures. The law provides for a time\nextension of parental leave, which could be used until the child\u2019s twelfth\nyear (instead of his/her eighth year, as set out in the previous legislation).\nThe partially paid (30%) parental leave is extended from the child\u2019s third\nyear of age to his/her sixth year, while the unpaid one from the sixth to the\ntwelfth year. Furthermore, this provision applies to parents with an\nindividual income lower than 2.5 times the monthly minimum pension scheme.\n\nA similar extension is introduced for cases of adoption or foster care, for\nwhich the possibility of taking parental leave shall start from the child\u2019s\nentrance into the family. It will also be possible to opt for a part-time\nworking arrangement instead of parental leave in case the staff structure\nprovides for part-time positions. Moreover, paternity leave is extended to all\ncategories of workers \u2013 not only to employees as it is now. In general terms,\nseveral changes have been made to parental and maternity leave. In conclusion,\nthe 2017 Budget Law sets out additional provisions. The most relevant are:\n\n  * Support Fund for Higher Birth-Rates ( _Fondo di sostegno alla natalit\u00e0_ ): this fund is aimed at promoting access to credit for families with one or more children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2017;\n  * childbirth bonus ( _bonus beb\u00e8_ ): this \u20ac800 lump sum is granted upon the birth or adoption of a child, and is paid by INPS in a single instalment following the ad hoc application to be filed by the future mother;\n  * Support Fund for Family Allowances ( _Fondo per l\u2019incremento degli assegni al nucleo familiare_ ): this fund is targeted at Italian citizens working in another EU Member State who have four or more children;\n  * cr\u00e8che and baby-sitting vouchers: the cr\u00e8che voucher is aimed at supporting the enrolment in public or private cr\u00e8ches, or alternatively at bolstering the introduction of support tools at home in the case of children below three years of age, affected by severe chronic diseases. The new provisions furthermore enable both employed and self-employed mothers to apply for a cr\u00e8che or baby-sitting voucher in lieu of parental leave (wholly or partially).\n\n#### Statutory leave arrangements\n\nMaternity leave  \n  \n---  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\nTwo months before and three months after delivery (or one month before and\nfour months after delivery). In some specific cases, additional months are\nenvisaged.  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n100% of basic remuneration (80% to be paid by INPS, and 20% by the employer)  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS (80% of basic remuneration) and employers (20%)  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct. no. 151/2001  \n  \nParental leave  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\n11 months (to be shared between the mother and the father)  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n30% of basic remuneration  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct no. 151/2001  \n  \nPaternity leave  \n  \nMaximum duration\n\n|\n\nTwo days in 2017, and up to four days in 2018 (it can be raised up to five\ndays if the father replaces the mother in relation to the mandatory leave\nperiod).  \n  \nReimbursement\n\n|\n\n100% anticipated by the employer and subsequently reimbursed by INPS, as\nprovided for by law in relation to maternity leave in general  \n  \nWho pays?\n\n|\n\nINPS  \n  \nLegal basis\n\n|\n\nAct no. 92/2012, Act no. 80/2015 (Jobs Act \u2013 work\u2013life balance, \u2018JABalance\u2019),\nand 2017 Budget Law  \n  \n#### Sick leave\n\nIn case of illness, the employee has the right to maintain his/her job during\nthe sick leave (so-called \u2018protected period\u2019) as set out in the relevant NCBA.\nDuring this period, the employer cannot dismiss the worker.\n\nIf sick, the employee must inform the employer as soon as possible, before the\nbeginning of his/her working day. Consequently, a doctor must certify the\nstate of illness, submitting the certificate to INPS through an online\nprocedure. INPS makes the certificate available for the employer.\n\nThe employee receives a special indemnity, calculated as 50% of basic\nremuneration from the fourth day to the 20thday of illness. From the 21st day\non, the indemnity amounts to 66.66% of basic remuneration.\n\n#### Retirement age\n\nAct no. 201/2011 radically reformed the Italian social security system,\nallowing for a yearly increase in the retirement age in order to adapt it to\nthe population\u2019s increasing life expectancy.\n\nIn the framework of measures addressing retirement rules and pension benefits,\nand following a long phase of consultations with trade unions, the 2017 Budget\nLaw introduced three early retirement schemes targeting people aged at least\n63 who are no more than three years and seven months away from statutory\nretirement age: the social advance pension payment ( _anticipo pensionistico\nsociale_ , special APe), the advance pension payment ( _anticipo\npensionistico_ , general APe), and the temporary supplementary advance annuity\n( _rendita integrativa temporanea anticipata_ , RITA). In greater detail,\nspecific categories of disadvantaged people will have the possibility to\naccess the special APE, which is funded by the State. The general APe can be\naccessed by other workers upon taking out a 20-year loan intended to pay back\nthe anticipated sum, as well as a life insurance policy subsidised by the\nState. Finally, workers enrolled in supplementary private pension schemes will\nhave the opportunity to apply for RITA, an advance pension payment subject to\na 15% maximum taxation rate.\n\nThe act also eliminated caps on the value of supplementary pension\ncontributions that can be exempted from income taxation, a measure that is\nlikely to promote the establishment of contractual pension funds in the\nframework of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe new coalition government between the Five Star Movement and the League\nwhich took office in mid-2018 introduced in early 2019 an anticipated\nretirement scheme, which will last for three years, for people whose age and\nyears of contribution add to 100 (the so called \u2018 _quota 100_ \u2019).\nIndividual employment relations are the relationship between the individual\nworker and their employer. This relationship is shaped by legal regulation and\nby the outcomes of social partner negotiations over the terms and conditions\ngoverning the employment relationship. This section looks into the start and\ntermination of the employment relationship and entitlements and obligations in\nItaly.\nAccording to applicable legislation, the minimum working age is fixed at 16\nyears, except for apprenticeships for which it is fixed at 15 years. The\nwritten form is generally not required with regard to employment contracts\n(except in some cases, such as apprenticeships), but the employer is obliged\nto inform the worker in writing of applied working conditions. To be valid,\nthe employment contract has to be agreed upon by both parties. As a\nconsequence, where there is a relevant mistake about personal qualities and\nskills, the agreement cannot be considered valid.\nThe provisions of the Italian Civil Code on individual dismissals were\nsubstantially modified by special laws (Act no. 604/1966, the Workers\u2019\nStatute, Act no. 108/1990, Act No. 92/2012 and by the latest labour market\nreform \u2013 the so-called \u2018Jobs Act\u2019).\nWith Jobs Act, a binary system has been created: on the one hand, the new\nregulation applies to new hires starting from March 2015.

This section\nbriefly summarises regulation and issues regarding working time, overtime,\npart-time work as well as working time flexibility in Italy.\n\n## Working time regulation\n\nThe provisions on working hours and overtime are included in Act no. 66/2003,\nas amended by Act no. 213/2004. In principle, employees are supposed to work\n40 hours per week, unless more favourable provisions contained in NCBAs reduce\nsaid duration; nevertheless, the ordinary weekly working time shall be\nreferred to the average duration of the working activity within a period no\nlonger than one year. In any case, the duration of the weekly working time\ncannot exceed 48 hours per week, including any overtime hours. Such maximum\nduration must be calculated within a reference period not exceeding four\nmonths, unless more favourable provisions contained in NCBAs reduce said\nduration or increase the reference period up to six months. The above-\nmentioned provisions do not apply to executives. Pursuant to some NCBAs, the\nprovisions on overtime do not apply to managers _._\n\nFor more detailed information on working time (including annual leave,\nstatutory and collectively agreed working time), please consult:\n\n  * Publication: Working time in 2017\u20132018 - Review\n\n## Overtime regulation\n\nUnless differently provided for by NCBAs, overtime work should be used\nsparingly and when exceptional technical or production-related circumstances\noccur. In any case, overtime shall be agreed between the employer and the\nemployee and cannot exceed 250 hours a year. According to the provisions set\nout in NCBAs, the cost of overtime hours is higher than ordinary working\nhours. Decentralised-level agreements can set out different provisions to\nregulate overtime in order to better manage working time within the firm.\n\n#### Part-time work\n\n\u2018Part-time work\u2019 indicates an employment contract in which working hours are\nfewer than the standard 40 hours per week. The reduction in working hours can\nbe implemented in three different ways:\n\n  * horizontal part-time: the employee works every day for a shorter number of hours;\n  * vertical part-time: the employee works full day, but only on specific days;\n  * mixed part-time ( _part-time misto_ ): a combination of the two types described above.\n\nPart-time work is generally governed by NCBAs, with some specific aspects\nregulated at firm level.\n\nAnother change introduced by the Jobs Act is the possibility to make the part-\ntime contract more flexible, by simplifying the regulation on additional\nworking hours. In greater detail, employers would be entitled to ask employees\nworking under a horizontal part-time arrangement (a contract reducing daily\nworking hours) to perform, within the limits established by NCBAs, the working\nhours exceeding the weekly hours settled by the individual contract, upon\npayment of additional remuneration. In the absence of an NCBA, overtime work\ncannot overcome 15% of the weekly working hours agreed upon in the individual\ncontract. Unless differently established by NCBAs, the increase cannot be\ngreater than 25% of the yearly working hours agreed in the individual\ncontract.\n\nAs shown in the table below, the shares of part-time workers are aligned with\nthe EU average, with a slightly greater difference between women and men.\n\n#### Persons employed part-time in Italy and EU28 (% of total employment)\n\n|\n\n**2012**\n\n|\n\n**2013**\n\n|\n\n**2014**\n\n|\n\n**2015**\n\n|\n\n**2016**\n\n|\n\n**2017**\n\n|\n\n**2018**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nTotal (EU28)\n\n|\n\n18.6\n\n|\n\n19\n\n|\n\n19\n\n|\n\n19\n\n|\n\n18.9\n\n|\n\n18.7\n\n|\n\n18.5  \n  \nTotal (Italy)\n\n|\n\n16.7\n\n|\n\n17.6\n\n|\n\n18\n\n|\n\n18.2\n\n|\n\n18.5\n\n|\n\n18.5\n\n|\n\n18.3  \n  \nWomen (EU28)\n\n|\n\n31.4\n\n|\n\n31.8\n\n|\n\n31.7\n\n|\n\n31.5\n\n|\n\n31.4\n\n|\n\n31.1\n\n|\n\n30.8  \n  \nWomen (Italy)\n\n|\n\n30.8\n\n|\n\n31.6\n\n|\n\n32.1\n\n|\n\n32.4\n\n|\n\n32.7\n\n|\n\n32.5\n\n|\n\n32.4  \n  \nMen (EU28)\n\n|\n\n7.7\n\n|\n\n8.1\n\n|\n\n8.2\n\n|\n\n8.2\n\n|\n\n8.2\n\n|\n\n8.1\n\n|\n\n8  \n  \nMen (Italy)\n\n|\n\n6.5\n\n|\n\n7.3\n\n|\n\n7.7\n\n|\n\n7.9\n\n|\n\n8.1\n\n|\n\n8.2\n\n|\n\n7.9  \n  \nSource: Eurostat Labour Force Survey [lfsi_pt_a] \u2013 Persons employed part-time\n(20 to 64 years of age) \u2013 total and by sex.\n\n#### Involuntary part-time\n\nInvoluntary part-time workers can be defined as those working part time\nbecause they could not find a full-time job.\n\n#### Persons employed in involuntary part-time in Italy and EU28 **(% of total\npart-time employment)**\n\n|\n\n**2012**\n\n|\n\n**2013**\n\n|\n\n**2014**\n\n|\n\n**2015**\n\n|\n\n**2016**\n\n|\n\n**2017**\n\n|\n\n**2018**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nTotal (EU28)\n\n|\n\n27.7\n\n|\n\n29.3\n\n|\n\n29.6\n\n|\n\n29.1\n\n|\n\n27.7\n\n|\n\n26.4\n\n|\n\n24.8  \n  \nTotal (Italy)\n\n|\n\n58.5\n\n|\n\n62.8\n\n|\n\n65.4\n\n|\n\n65.6\n\n|\n\n64.3\n\n|\n\n62.5\n\n|\n\n65.7  \n  \nWomen (EU28)\n\n|\n\n24.5\n\n|\n\n26\n\n|\n\n26.3\n\n|\n\n25.7\n\n|\n\n24.6\n\n|\n\n23.2\n\n|\n\n22.1  \n  \nWomen (Italy)\n\n|\n\n54.2\n\n|\n\n58.4\n\n|\n\n60.4\n\n|\n\n60.3\n\n|\n\n58.8\n\n|\n\n56.9\n\n|\n\n60.8  \n  \nMen (EU28)\n\n|\n\n38.5\n\n|\n\n39.9\n\n|\n\n40.2\n\n|\n\n39.9\n\n|\n\n37.6\n\n|\n\n36.2\n\n|\n\n33.4  \n  \nMen (Italy)\n\n|\n\n72.7\n\n|\n\n76.5\n\n|\n\n80.6\n\n|\n\n81\n\n|\n\n80.2\n\n|\n\n78.8\n\n|\n\n80.3  \n  \nSource: Eurostat Labour Force Survey [lfsa_eppgai]- involuntary part-time\nemployment as a percentage of the total part-time employment, by sex and age\n(20 to 64 years of age)\n\n#### Night work\n\nPursuant to Article 1 of Act no. 66/2003, as subsequently amended, a night\nworker is one who, in the normal course, works at least three hours of his/her\ndaily working time during night time (who is likely, during night time, to\nwork at least such a proportion of his/her annual working time as may be\nspecified in a collective agreement or a workforce agreement. Act no. 66/2003\n(Art. 1, paragraph 2) defines night time as any period of not less than seven\nconsecutive hours including the time span between midnight and 05:00.\n\n#### Shift work\n\nArticle 1 of Act no. 66/2003, as subsequently amended, defines shift work as\nany method of work organisation, including in shifts, according to which\nworkers are subsequently assigned to the same working stations according to a\ncertain pattern, including on a rotational basis, which may be continuous or\ndiscontinuous, and which entails the need for workers to perform a job at\ndifferent times over a given period of days or weeks.\n\n#### Weekend work\n\nThere is no legal regulation on weekend work.\n\n#### Rest and breaks\n\nIn general, rest periods and breaks shall be enjoyed consecutively. The\nparties may agree upon longer rest periods than those established by law (11\nhours).\n\n## Working time flexibility\n\nWorking time flexibility is not regulated by law. The law only sets out the\nmaximum amount of working hours, leaving all other aspects to social dialogue\nand contractual freedom within specific limits for certain categories or\ncircumstances (such as night work). Some types of time flexibility strategies\nare beginning to be provided for or introduced in collective agreements, but\nthe general trend is to fix working hours within a specific time span,\ngenerally from 09.00 to 18.00.\nWorking time: \u2018Any period during which the worker is working, at the\nemployer\u2019s disposal and carrying out his activities or duties, in accordance\nwith national laws and/or practice\u2019 (Directive 2003/88/EC).

The\nparties may agree upon longer rest periods than those established by law (11\nhours).\n\n## Working time flexibility\n\nWorking time flexibility is not regulated by law. The law only sets out the\nmaximum amount of working hours, leaving all other aspects to social dialogue\nand contractual freedom within specific limits for certain categories or\ncircumstances (such as night work). Some types of time flexibility strategies\nare beginning to be provided for or introduced in collective agreements, but\nthe general trend is to fix working hours within a specific time span,\ngenerally from 09.00 to 18.00.\nWorking time: \u2018Any period during which the worker is working, at the\nemployer\u2019s disposal and carrying out his activities or duties, in accordance\nwith national laws and/or practice\u2019 (Directive 2003/88/EC). This section\nbriefly summarises regulation and issues regarding working time, overtime,\npart-time work as well as working time flexibility in Italy.\nThe provisions on working hours and overtime are included in Act no. 66/2003,\nas amended by Act no. 213/2004. In principle, employees are supposed to work\n40 hours per week, unless more favourable provisions contained in NCBAs reduce\nsaid duration; nevertheless, the ordinary weekly working time shall be\nreferred to the average duration of the working activity within a period no\nlonger than one year. In any case, the duration of the weekly working time\ncannot exceed 48 hours per week, including any overtime hours. Such maximum\nduration must be calculated within a reference period not exceeding four\nmonths, unless more favourable provisions contained in NCBAs reduce said\nduration or increase the reference period up to six months. The above-\nmentioned provisions do not apply to executives. Pursuant to some NCBAs, the\nprovisions on overtime do not apply to managers _._\nFor more detailed information on working time (including annual leave,\nstatutory and collectively agreed working time), please consult:\nUnless differently provided for by NCBAs, overtime work should be used\nsparingly and when exceptional technical or production-related circumstances\noccur. In any case, overtime shall be agreed between the employer and the\nemployee and cannot exceed 250 hours a year. According to the provisions set\nout in NCBAs, the cost of overtime hours is higher than ordinary working\nhours. Decentralised-level agreements can set out different provisions to\nregulate overtime in order to better manage working time within the firm.\n\u2018Part-time work\u2019 indicates an employment contract in which working hours are\nfewer than the standard 40 hours per week. The reduction in working hours can\nbe implemented in three different ways:\nPart-time work is generally governed by NCBAs, with some specific aspects\nregulated at firm level.\nAnother change introduced by the Jobs Act is the possibility to make the part-\ntime contract more flexible, by simplifying the regulation on additional\nworking hours. In greater detail, employers would be entitled to ask employees\nworking under a horizontal part-time arrangement (a contract reducing daily\nworking hours) to perform, within the limits established by NCBAs, the working\nhours exceeding the weekly hours settled by the individual contract, upon\npayment of additional remuneration. In the absence of an NCBA, overtime work\ncannot overcome 15% of the weekly working hours agreed upon in the individual\ncontract. Unless differently established by NCBAs, the increase cannot be\ngreater than 25% of the yearly working hours agreed in the individual\ncontract.\nAs shown in the table below, the shares of part-time workers are aligned with\nthe EU average, with a slightly greater difference between women and men.\n **2012**\n **2013**\n **2014**\n **2015**\n **2016**\n **2017**\n **2018**\nTotal (EU28)\n18.6\n19\n19\n19\n18.9\n18.7\n18.5\nTotal (Italy)\n16.7\n17.6\n18\n18.2\n18.5\n18.5\n18.3\nWomen (EU28)\n31.4\n31.8\n31.7\n31.5\n31.4\n31.1\n30.8\nWomen (Italy)\n30.8\n31.6\n32.1\n32.4\n32.7\n32.5\n32.4\nMen (EU28)\n7.7\n8.1\n8.2\n8.2\n8.2\n8.1\n8\nMen (Italy)\n6.5\n7.3\n7.7\n7.9\n8.1\n8.2\n7.9\nSource: Eurostat Labour Force Survey [lfsi_pt_a] \u2013 Persons employed part-time\n(20 to 64 years of age) \u2013 total and by sex.\nInvoluntary part-time workers can be defined as those working part time\nbecause they could not find a full-time job.\n **2012**\n **2013**\n **2014**\n **2015**\n **2016**\n **2017**\n **2018**\nTotal (EU28)\n27.7\n29.3\n29.6\n29.1\n27.7\n26.4\n24.8\nTotal (Italy)\n58.5\n62.8\n65.4\n65.6\n64.3\n62.5\n65.7\nWomen (EU28)\n24.5\n26\n26.3\n25.7\n24.6\n23.2\n22.1\nWomen (Italy)\n54.2\n58.4\n60.4\n60.3\n58.8\n56.9\n60.8\nMen (EU28)\n38.5\n39.9\n40.2\n39.9\n37.6\n36.2\n33.4\nMen (Italy)\n72.7\n76.5\n80.6\n81\n80.2\n78.8\n80.3\nSource: Eurostat Labour Force Survey [lfsa_eppgai]- involuntary part-time\nemployment as a percentage of the total part-time employment, by sex and age\n(20 to 64 years of age)\nPursuant to Article 1 of Act no. 66/2003, as subsequently amended, a night\nworker is one who, in the normal course, works at least three hours of his/her\ndaily working time during night time (who is likely, during night time, to\nwork at least such a proportion of his/her annual working time as may be\nspecified in a collective agreement or a workforce agreement.

The main obligations upon the employer are as follows:\n\n  * to prepare a document containing an assessment of health and safety risks related to the activity of the company, a list of prevention and protection measures as well as of the special individual protection devices, and the measures aimed at improving health and safety at work;\n  * to arrange the Prevention and Protection Service ( _Servizio di Prevenzione e Protezione_ ) and to appoint the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service ( _Responsabile del Servizio di Prevenzione e Protezione_ ). The Prevention and Protection Service can be handled either internally or by an external contractor. If the Prevention and Protection Service is arranged within the company, the employer may either take on its functions, or appoint a person with suitable skills and expertise. If the company carries out an industrial activity with more than 30 employees or other activities with more than 200 employees, the employer is obliged to appoint a person and cannot perform the functions of the Prevention and Protection Service directly. The arrangement of the service within the company is compulsory when its activity is deemed to be particularly \u2018dangerous\u2019 (companies exposed to the risk of serious accidents, companies with more than 200 employees, thermoelectric power stations, hospitals, etc.);\n  * to notify the National Labour Inspection Office ( _Ispettorato nazionale del lavoro_ ) and the Local Health Authority ( _Azienda Sanitaria Locale_ , ASL) of the name of the person appointed as Head of the Prevention and Protection Service;\n  * to appoint a physician ( _medico competente_ ), who \u2013 among other things \u2013 shall cooperate with the employer and the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service to arrange and implement occupational health and safety measures, carry out the clinical and medical tests for employees, and provide his/her own opinion on employees\u2019 suitability for their specific duties;\n  * to take the necessary measures for employees\u2019 health and safety;\n  * to inform and train employees on occupational health and safety risks;\n  * to adapt workplaces in compliance with applicable legislation;\n  * to adapt workplaces and working time if employees use visual display units.\nMaintaining health and well-being should be high-priority for workers and\nemployers alike.

If the Prevention and Protection Service is arranged within the company, the employer may either take on its functions, or appoint a person with suitable skills and expertise. If the company carries out an industrial activity with more than 30 employees or other activities with more than 200 employees, the employer is obliged to appoint a person and cannot perform the functions of the Prevention and Protection Service directly. The arrangement of the service within the company is compulsory when its activity is deemed to be particularly \u2018dangerous\u2019 (companies exposed to the risk of serious accidents, companies with more than 200 employees, thermoelectric power stations, hospitals, etc.);\n  * to notify the National Labour Inspection Office ( _Ispettorato nazionale del lavoro_ ) and the Local Health Authority ( _Azienda Sanitaria Locale_ , ASL) of the name of the person appointed as Head of the Prevention and Protection Service;\n  * to appoint a physician ( _medico competente_ ), who \u2013 among other things \u2013 shall cooperate with the employer and the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service to arrange and implement occupational health and safety measures, carry out the clinical and medical tests for employees, and provide his/her own opinion on employees\u2019 suitability for their specific duties;\n  * to take the necessary measures for employees\u2019 health and safety;\n  * to inform and train employees on occupational health and safety risks;\n  * to adapt workplaces in compliance with applicable legislation;\n  * to adapt workplaces and working time if employees use visual display units.\nMaintaining health and well-being should be high-priority for workers and\nemployers alike. Health is an asset closely associated with a person\u2019s quality\nof life and longevity, as well as their ability to work. A healthy economy\ndepends on a healthy workforce; organisations lose productivity through ill-\nhealth of their workers. This section looks into psychosocial risks and health\nand safety in Italy.\nThe overall number of accidents at work has been decreasing in recent years,\nboth in absolute terms and compared to employment rates. Yet, the number of\nfatal accidents was on the rise again in 2015, reversing the previous\ndecreasing trend.\n\n\n_**2013**_\n _ **2014**_\n _ **2** 015_\n **2** 016\n _ **2017**_\nManufacturing and services\n536,880\n512,697\n493,831\n500,763\n501,761\nAgriculture\n40,334\n39,210\n38,046\n36,230\n34,406\nPublic administration\n117,777\n111,721\n105,378\n104,630\n105,262\nTotal\n694,991\n663,628\n637,255\n641,623\n641,429\nSource: National Institute for the Insurance against Accidents at Work (\n_Istituto nazionale per l\u2019assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro_ ,\nInail),IL_DN_TT_AG_GES_TEM.\n **2008**\n **2009**\n **2010**\n **2011**\n **2012**\n **2013**\n **2014**\n **2015**\n **2016**\nAll accidents\n399,689\n383,274\n362,385\n321,084\n274,040\n269,629\n251,769\n239,385\n239,136\nPercentage change on previous year\n-4.1\n-5.5\n-11.4\n-14.7\n-1.6\n-6.6\n-4.9\n-0.1\nPer 1,000 employees\n23.2\n22.5\n21.5\n19.0\n16.2\n16.2\n15.0\n14.1\n13.8\nSource: Eurostat, [hsw_mi01] and [lfsa_eegaed]\n\n\n**2013**\n **2014**\n **2015**\n **2016**\n **2017**\n _Manufacturing and services_\n1,022\n969\n1,093\n954\n950\n _Agriculture_\n195\n181\n168\n143\n155\n _Public administration_\n41\n31\n40\n50\n34\n _Total_\n1,258\n1,181\n1,301\n1,147\n1,139\nSource: Inail; authors\u2019 calculation based on [IL_DN_TT_AG_GES_TEM]\nArticle 2087 of the Italian Civil Code sets forth, as a rule, that the\nemployer shall implement all necessary measures to guarantee each employee\u2019s\nhealth and safety while s/he is in the workplace, taking into account\npeculiarities, experience, and skills involved.\nAct no. 81/2008 sets forth most of the specific provisions on health and\nsafety at work. The main obligations upon the employer are as follows:\nSkills, learning and employability\n\nSkills are the passport to employment; the better skilled an individual, the\nmore employable they are. Good skills also tend to secure better-quality jobs\nand better earnings. This section briefly summarises the Italian system for\nensuring skills and employability and looks into the extent of training.\n\n## National system for ensuring skills and employability\n\nA specific type of employment contract has been created to serve as a \u2018bridge\nbetween education and the world of work\u2019. This is the apprenticeship, in which\nthe employer is obliged not only to pay remuneration to employees, but also to\ntrain them. In return, the employer can benefit from some tax relief and\nreductions in social security contributions. The apprenticeship is deemed to\nbe an indefinite contract, but there is a specific day (when the training can\nbe considered concluded) when the employer can dismiss the employee. If\ndismissal does not occur, the apprenticeship automatically turns into a proper\nindefinite contract.\n\nCurrently, there are three kinds of apprenticeship:\n\n  1. apprenticeship aimed at helping students obtain a vocational qualification, targeting people between 15 and 25 years old;\n  2. profession-oriented apprenticeship for people between 18 and 29 years old;\n  3. apprenticeship enabling students to conduct research or obtain a higher educational qualification; this type of apprenticeship is targeted at people between 18 and 29 years old who hold a second-level diploma.\n\nFurthermore, in March 2015 the government presented a new reform aimed at\nintroducing amendments to the educational and vocational system in order to\nachieve better integration between education and training, on the one hand,\nand the labour market, on the other.\n\nHowever, it also confers increased powers on school principals over hiring and\npromotions, and envisages tax breaks for private schools, and the hiring of\n100,000 permanent teachers.\n\n## Training\n\nThe main public institutions that have to be taken into consideration when\ntalking about training are the Regions. They enter into play in relation to\nboth apprenticeship and internship regulations. As to apprenticeships, the\nRegions have to define and structure an important part of the apprentice\u2019s\ntraining (basic and cross-cutting training), whose cost is shouldered by them.\nAs to internships, the Regions must provide for some of the regulating\nprinciples, such as the minimum amount of the indemnity to be provided to the\nintern.\n\nVocational training joint institutions ( _fondi interprofessionali_ ), too,\nmust be taken into consideration. These are special quasi-public bodies\npromoted by social partners through confederation agreements signed by\nemployers\u2019 and employees\u2019 most representative unions. Pursuant to Act no.\n388/2000, companies must finance these funds with 0.30% of the contributions\npaid to INPS.\n\nVocational training paritarian institutions fund company training activities \u2013\nat both sectoral and territorial levels \u2013 that companies can decide to\nimplement for their employees.\nSkills are the passport to employment; the better skilled an individual, the\nmore employable they are.

Therefore, developing or\nintroducing different forms of work organisation are of particular interest\nbecause of the expected effect on productivity, efficiency and competitiveness\nof companies, as well as on workers\u2019 working conditions.

Therefore, equality is one of the fundamental principles of the\nwhole Italian legal system.\n\nSecondly, dismissals for discriminatory reasons (political, sexual, religious,\nand others) are considered null and void, and the judge can order the employer\nto reintegrate the employee into his/her job.\n\nThere are special provisions to facilitate the access of people with\ndisabilities to the labour market. The Italian legislation promotes the\nemployment of people with disabilities through compulsory hiring ( _assunzioni\nobbligatorie_ ) (Act no. 68/1999). The category of people with disabilities\nincludes: people with physical and mental impairments; those whose\ndisabilities are medically certified as comprising more than 33% of their\ncapacity; persons who are blind; and those who are deaf-mute.\n\nStarting in January 2017, the number of people with disabilities who must be\nemployed relates to the number of employees in the company, namely: if the\nemployer is staffed with more than 50 employees, 7% of them must be people\nwith disabilities; if the employer has from 36 to 50 employees, two of them\nmust be people with disabilities; if the employer has from 15 to 35 employees,\nthere must be one person with disabilities.\n\nThe same obligations shall apply to political parties, trade unions, and NGOs.\n\nThe applicable legislation envisages new incentives for hiring people with\ndisabilities: as to subjects with mental or intellectual impairments,\nincentives amount to 70% of their monthly salary for a maximum of 60 months.\n\nThe new set of rules moreover introduced a specific database aimed at\nmonitoring the workflow of people with disabilities. Finally, penalties for\nemployers that do not abide by these rules have been increased.\n\n## Equal pay and the gender pay gap\n\nNo specific provisions exist as to the implementation of an equal pay\nstructure; the whole issue is regulated by the provision against\ndiscrimination in whatever form it may occur.\n\nNational-level collective agreements establish a minimum salary for each\nsector, which is mandatory for all the employers of that sector.\n\nA maximum level of remuneration does not exist: therefore, an employer could\ntheoretically pay a different amount to each employee. If there exists a\ngender-based difference in the remuneration within the same company, the issue\nhas to be tackled through social dialogue or before a court provided the non-\ndiscrimination provisions can be applied to the specific situation.\n\n## Quota regulations\n\nNo legal obligations for specific quotas are in place in Italy, besides those\nfor people with disabilities (see the third paragraph under the \u2018Equality and\nnon-discrimination at work\u2019 heading).\nFirst of all, Article 3 of the Italian Constitution states that \u2018all citizens\nhave equal social dignity and are equal before the law, without distinction of\nsex, race, language, religion, political opinion, personal and social\nconditions\u2019.

Prior to the\npassage of right to try laws, patients needed FDA approval to use experimental\ndrugs. Currently, 41 U.S. states have passed right to try laws. The value of\nthese laws has been questioned on multiple grounds, including the fact that\npharmaceutical manufacturers would have no obligation to provide the therapies\nbeing sought.[1] A federal right to try law was passed in May 2018, but as of\nJune 2019 only two patients had been accepted for experimental therapies.[2]\nAccording to Scott Gottlieb, who served as commissioner of the FDA under\nPresident Donald Trump, the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests for\naccess to experimental drugs prior to the passage of right to try\nlegislation.[3]\nIn May 2014, Colorado became the first state to pass a right-to-try law.[5] As\nof August 2018[update], 41 states had enacted such laws: Alabama, Alaska,\nArizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,\nIowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,\nMinnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,\nNorth Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South\nCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.[4][6][7][8]\nIn January 2017, a federal right to try bill was introduced in the Senate by\nRepublican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.[9] Johnson was able to pass his bill in\nthe Senate on August 3, 2017 in a unanimous consent motion.[10] Johnson had\nthreatened to hold up a Senate vote on the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017\n(FDARA), a must-pass piece of legislation that allows the FDA to operate, if\nan amendment on right to try was not added to that bill. Johnson agreed to\ndrop a hold on FDARA in exchange for a unanimous consent motion.[11] A\ncompanion House bill was introduced in February 2017; the following month it\nwas referred to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security,\nand Investigations.[12] On March 21, 2018, the House of Representatives passed\na right to try bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration.[13] On May\n22, the Senate passed S.204, the 'Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan\nMcLinn and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act', and sent it to President Trump\nwho signed it on May 30, 2018 creating a uniform system for terminal patients\nseeking access to investigational treatments.[14]\nThe chief advocate of right-to-try laws is the Goldwater Institute, a\nlibertarian think tank based in Arizona, which created the legislation\ntemplate on which the state laws are modeled.[15] Kurt Altman, national policy\nadviser for the Institute, has said that right-to-try laws return control of\nmedical decisions \"back to a local level\".[16] Other proponents include\npatients and their families, as well as patient advocate groups.[17]\nSupporters of these laws sometimes describe them as \"Dallas Buyers Club\"\nbills, a reference to a movie about an American man with AIDS who smuggled\nunapproved treatments from foreign countries to fellow patients.[1] Some have\nlikened the efforts of terminally ill patients to procure unapproved drugs in\ndevelopment to those of ACT-UP and other AIDS organizations of the 1980s.[18]\nOne ethical argument for the right to try unapproved treatments is that if\npatients have the right to die through physician-assisted suicide or voluntary\neuthanasia, they should also be afforded the right to try.[19]\nIn 2016, Houston oncologist Dr. Ebrahim Delpassand testified to a US Senate\ncommittee that he treated 78 patients for neuroendocrine cancer with LU-177\noctreotate under the Texas Right to Try law, after the FDA refused permission\nto include those patients in the clinical trial that he was running.[20][21]\nHowever, the drug's manufacturer, Advanced Accelerator Applications, has made\nthis drug available through an expanded access program for patients with\nneuroendocrine tumors, so it is disputed whether this is a substantiated case\nof a right to try law being used to gain patients access to an investigational\nproduct.[22] State legislators in Texas and North Carolina have introduced\nbills that would expand state right-to-try laws to include stem cell and\ntissue based regenerative therapies currently in development and to allow\npatients with serious, chronic illness to use the right-to-try\npathway.[23][24]\nBioethicists and other scholars have questioned the extent to which right-to-\ntry laws will actually benefit patients. Jonathan Darrow, Arthur Caplan, Alta\nCharo, Rebecca Dresser, Alison Bateman-House and others have pointed out that\nthe laws do not require physicians to prescribe experimental therapies, do not\nrequire insurance companies to pay for them, and do not require manufacturers\nto provide them.[25][26] Because the laws do not actually provide a right to\nreceive experimental therapies, they could be considered toothless legislation\nthat offers only false hope to dying people.[27][28] Even if the laws work as\nintended, they would be problematic to critics. Because the laws require only\nthat drugs have completed the first of three phases of clinical testing, there\nis no data on the efficacy of the drugs, especially in very sick people. There\nis also no safety data on how they would affect very sick people. This makes\ninformed consent on the part of the patient more difficult. Informed consent\nentails knowledge of the pros and cons of a proposed treatment, then a\ndecision made in light of those pros and cons.[29] Some states' right-to-try\nlaws also put patients at risk of losing hospice or home health care,[30] and\nthe costs surrounding treatment can be prohibitive, something right-to-try\nlaws do not fix. Bioethicist Alta Charo called the laws \"a simplistic way of\ngoing after much more complicated issues.\"[31]\nMedical and health experts have also voiced concerns. If the laws were to\ngrant patients access to unapproved drugs, they could hasten death or cause\nincreased suffering.[32] Peter Temin wrote that \"there is always a chance that\nany given drug will fail to cure a condition or will induce an adverse\nreaction,\" such as becoming sick, or sicker, or even dying.[33] Drugs that are\nnot fully studied may lead to more adverse reactions in patients. The laws\nreduce FDA oversight of drug regulation.[34] Another criticism is that state\nright-to-try laws may be unconstitutional, because they involve states\nregulating medicine despite federal legislation that regulates the interstate\nmarketing of medicine.[35] Various authors have predicted that right-to-try\nlaws would be struck down if they were taken to court.[36][37] A 2014 paper in\nJAMA Internal Medicine argued that right to try laws \"seem likely to be\nfutile.\"[38]\nIn April 2017, oncologist David Gorski wrote in _Science-Based Medicine_ that\nthe right-to-try law is harmful to society as it is popular with the public\nwho do not understand how the FDA works, Gorski calls this \"placebo\nlegislation. They make lawmakers feel good, but they do nothing concrete to\nhelp actual patients.\" Gorski states that right-to-try laws enable \"cancer\nquack\" like the Burzynski Clinic to operate for years. \"It's also important to\nremember that the real purpose of right-to-try laws is not to help patients,\nbut to neuter the FDA's ability to regulate certain drugs, consistent with the\nsource of this legislation.\" Gorski further states that these laws \"rest on a\nfantasy... of false hope ... that is rooted in libertarian politics ... that\nclaims that deregulation is the cure for everything.\"[39]\nIn January 2019 Jann Bellamy added that the right-to-try does not ensure \"that\nonly patients who have no other treatment options receive access; that costs\nare appropriate; that informed consent is legally and ethically sound; and\nthat the proposed treatment plan offers a favorable risk/benefit profile for\nthe patient.\" Additionally, \"there is no regulatory infrastructure spelling\nout just how patients and physicians should go about accessing investigational\ndrugs or how drug companies should respond.\"[40] Harriet Hall, MD expressed\nconcerns that patients may not completely comprehend the risks involved in\ntaking medications available under the right-to-try law, nor understand the\nlow probability of success, especially patients who were not healthy enough to\nqualify to participate in clinical trials.[41] She states these patients may\nhave other medical conditions that could make them more vulnerable to\ncomplications from experimental treatments.[41]\nWhen President Trump signed the legislation into law in May 2018 he said, \"We\nwill be saving\u2014I don\u2019t even want to say thousands, because I think it\u2019s going\nto be much more.

In\nFebruary 2019, one of the namesakes of the federal law, Matt Bellina, who has\nALS, said that he gained access to an experimental treatment through the drug\ncompany Brainstorm.

Johnson agreed to\ndrop a hold on FDARA in exchange for a unanimous consent motion.[11] A\ncompanion House bill was introduced in February 2017; the following month it\nwas referred to the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security,\nand Investigations.[12] On March 21, 2018, the House of Representatives passed\na right to try bill, sending it to the Senate for consideration.[13] On May\n22, the Senate passed S.204, the 'Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan\nMcLinn and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act', and sent it to President Trump\nwho signed it on May 30, 2018 creating a uniform system for terminal patients\nseeking access to investigational treatments.[14]\nThe chief advocate of right-to-try laws is the Goldwater Institute, a\nlibertarian think tank based in Arizona, which created the legislation\ntemplate on which the state laws are modeled.[15] Kurt Altman, national policy\nadviser for the Institute, has said that right-to-try laws return control of\nmedical decisions \"back to a local level\".[16] Other proponents include\npatients and their families, as well as patient advocate groups.[17]\nSupporters of these laws sometimes describe them as \"Dallas Buyers Club\"\nbills, a reference to a movie about an American man with AIDS who smuggled\nunapproved treatments from foreign countries to fellow patients.[1] Some have\nlikened the efforts of terminally ill patients to procure unapproved drugs in\ndevelopment to those of ACT-UP and other AIDS organizations of the 1980s.[18]\nOne ethical argument for the right to try unapproved treatments is that if\npatients have the right to die through physician-assisted suicide or voluntary\neuthanasia, they should also be afforded the right to try.[19]\nIn 2016, Houston oncologist Dr. Ebrahim Delpassand testified to a US Senate\ncommittee that he treated 78 patients for neuroendocrine cancer with LU-177\noctreotate under the Texas Right to Try law, after the FDA refused permission\nto include those patients in the clinical trial that he was running.[20][21]\nHowever, the drug's manufacturer, Advanced Accelerator Applications, has made\nthis drug available through an expanded access program for patients with\nneuroendocrine tumors, so it is disputed whether this is a substantiated case\nof a right to try law being used to gain patients access to an investigational\nproduct.[22] State legislators in Texas and North Carolina have introduced\nbills that would expand state right-to-try laws to include stem cell and\ntissue based regenerative therapies currently in development and to allow\npatients with serious, chronic illness to use the right-to-try\npathway.[23][24]\nBioethicists and other scholars have questioned the extent to which right-to-\ntry laws will actually benefit patients. Jonathan Darrow, Arthur Caplan, Alta\nCharo, Rebecca Dresser, Alison Bateman-House and others have pointed out that\nthe laws do not require physicians to prescribe experimental therapies, do not\nrequire insurance companies to pay for them, and do not require manufacturers\nto provide them.[25][26] Because the laws do not actually provide a right to\nreceive experimental therapies, they could be considered toothless legislation\nthat offers only false hope to dying people.[27][28] Even if the laws work as\nintended, they would be problematic to critics. Because the laws require only\nthat drugs have completed the first of three phases of clinical testing, there\nis no data on the efficacy of the drugs, especially in very sick people. There\nis also no safety data on how they would affect very sick people. This makes\ninformed consent on the part of the patient more difficult. Informed consent\nentails knowledge of the pros and cons of a proposed treatment, then a\ndecision made in light of those pros and cons.[29] Some states' right-to-try\nlaws also put patients at risk of losing hospice or home health care,[30] and\nthe costs surrounding treatment can be prohibitive, something right-to-try\nlaws do not fix. Bioethicist Alta Charo called the laws \"a simplistic way of\ngoing after much more complicated issues.\"[31]\nMedical and health experts have also voiced concerns. If the laws were to\ngrant patients access to unapproved drugs, they could hasten death or cause\nincreased suffering.[32] Peter Temin wrote that \"there is always a chance that\nany given drug will fail to cure a condition or will induce an adverse\nreaction,\" such as becoming sick, or sicker, or even dying.[33] Drugs that are\nnot fully studied may lead to more adverse reactions in patients. The laws\nreduce FDA oversight of drug regulation.[34] Another criticism is that state\nright-to-try laws may be unconstitutional, because they involve states\nregulating medicine despite federal legislation that regulates the interstate\nmarketing of medicine.[35] Various authors have predicted that right-to-try\nlaws would be struck down if they were taken to court.[36][37] A 2014 paper in\nJAMA Internal Medicine argued that right to try laws \"seem likely to be\nfutile.\"[38]\nIn April 2017, oncologist David Gorski wrote in _Science-Based Medicine_ that\nthe right-to-try law is harmful to society as it is popular with the public\nwho do not understand how the FDA works, Gorski calls this \"placebo\nlegislation.

The agency is dedicated to these purposes, and it has been for more\nthan three decades.\nBuilding on our long-standing efforts to help patients and families who are\nfacing life-threatening diseases or conditions, the FDA is providing\ninformation for patients on the Right to Try Act. FDA\u2019s role in implementation\nof the Right to Try Act is largely focused on those obligations outlined in\nthe law, which is limited to receipt and posting of certain information\nsubmitted regarding Right to Try use.\nThe Right to Try Act permits/allows eligible patients to have access to\neligible investigational drugs.\nAn eligible patient is a patient who has:\nAn eligible investigational drug is an investigational drug:\nIf you are interested in Right to Try, you should discuss this pathway with\nyour licensed physician. Companies who develop and make drugs and biologics,\nalso known as sponsors, can provide information about whether their\ndrug/biologic is considered an eligible investigational drug under Right to\nTry and if they are able to provide the drug/biologic under the Right to Try\nAct. Ultimately, sponsors developing drugs for life-threatening diseases or\nconditions are responsible for determining whether to make their products\navailable to patients who qualify for access under the Right to Try Act.\nThe full text of the Right to Try Act, Public Law 115-176, can be found on US\nCongress\u2019s website: Public Law 115-176.\n\n**_1\\. If I\u2019m a patient or a physician and I have a question about the Right\nto Try Act, who do I ask?_**\nA: FDA recommends that patients first consult with their physician and that\nphysicians consult with the sponsor of the investigational drug or biological\nproduct. The sponsor is in the best position to provide information about\nwhether the drug or biological product meets the criteria to be considered an\neligible investigational drug for use under the Right to Try Act.\n_**2\\. If I identify a drug that I would like to use under the Right to Try\nAct, how do I know if it is an \u201celigible investigational drug\u201d?**_\nA: FDA recommends that you consult with the sponsor of the investigational\ndrug or biological product. The sponsor is in the best position to provide\ninformation about whether the drug or biological product meets the criteria to\nbe considered an eligible investigational drug for use under the Right to Try\nAct.\n_**3\\.

In this way, a REIT stock is similar to any other\nstock that represents ownership in an operating business. A REIT has two\nunique features: its primary business is managing groups of income-producing\nproperties and it must distribute most of its profits as dividends. Here we\ntake a look at REITs, their characteristics and how they are analyzed.\nTo qualify as a REIT with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a real estate\ncompany must agree to pay out at least 90% of its taxable profit in dividends\n(and fulfill additional but less important requirements).\nBy having REIT status, a company avoids corporate income tax. A regular\ncorporation makes a profit and pays taxes on its entire profit, and then\ndecides how to allocate its after-tax profits between dividends and\nreinvestment; a REIT simply distributes all or almost all of its profits and\ngets to skip the taxation.\nThere are a number of different types of REITs. Some fall into a special class\ncalled mortgage REITs. These REITs make loans secured by real estate, but they\ndo not generally own or operate real estate. Mortgage REITs require special\nanalysis. They are finance companies that use several hedging instruments to\nmanage their interest rate exposure. We will not consider them here.\nWhile a handful of hybrid REITs run both real estate operations and transact\nin mortgage loans, most REITs focus on the \"hard asset\" business of real\nestate operations. These are called equity REITs. When you read about REITs,\nyou are usually reading about equity REITs.\nEquity REITs tend to specialize in owning certain building types such as\napartments, regional malls, office buildings or lodging facilities. Some are\ndiversified and some are specialized, meaning they defy classification \u2013 such\nas, for example, a REIT that owns golf courses.\nREITs are dividend-paying stocks that focus on real estate. If you seek\nincome, you would consider them along with high-yield bond funds and dividend-\npaying stocks. As dividend-paying stocks, REITs are analyzed much like other\nstocks. But there are some large differences due to the accounting treatment\nof property.\nLet's illustrate with a simplified example. Suppose that a REIT buys a\nbuilding for $1 million. Accounting requires that our REIT charge depreciation\nagainst the asset. Let's assume that we spread the depreciation over 20 years\nin a straight line. Each year we will deduct $50,000 in depreciation expense\n($50,000 per year x 20 years = $1 million).\nLet's look at the simplified balance sheet and income statement above. In year\n10, our balance sheet carries the value of the building at $500,000 (i.e. the\nbook value), which is the original historical cost of $1 million minus\n$500,000 accumulated depreciation (10 years x $50,000 per year). Our income\nstatement deducts $190,000 of expenses from $200,000 in revenues, but $50,000\nof the expense is a depreciation charge.\nHowever, our REIT doesn't actually spend this money in year 10\u2014depreciation is\na non-cash charge. Therefore, we add back the depreciation charge to the net\nincome in order to produce funds from operations (FFO). The idea is that\ndepreciation unfairly reduces our net income because our building probably\ndidn't lose half its value over the last 10 years. FFO fixes this presumed\ndistortion by excluding the depreciation charge. FFO includes a few other\nadjustments, too.\nWe should note that FFO gets closer to cash flow than net income, but it does\nnot capture cash flow. Mainly, notice in the example above that we never\ncounted the $1 million spent to acquire the building (the capital\nexpenditure). A more accurate analysis would incorporate capital expenditures.\nCounting capital expenditures gives a figure known as adjusted FFO, but there\nis no universal consensus regarding its calculation.\nOur hypothetical balance sheet can help us understand the other common REIT\nmetric, net asset value (NAV). In year 10, the book value of our building was\nonly $500,000 because half of the original cost was depreciated. So, book\nvalue and related ratios like price-to-book\u2014often dubious in regard to general\nequities analysis\u2014are pretty much useless for REITs. NAV attempts to replace\nthe book value of a property with a better estimate of market value.\nCalculating NAV requires a somewhat subjective appraisal of the REIT's\nholdings. In the above example, we see the building generates $100,000 in\noperating income ($200,000 in revenues minus $100,000 in operating expenses).\nOne method would be to capitalize on the operating income based on a market\nrate. If we think the market's present cap rate for this type of building is\n8%, then our estimate of the building's value becomes $1.25 million ($100,000\nin operating income / 8% cap rate = $1,250,000).\nThis market value estimate replaces the book value of the building. We then\nwould deduct the mortgage debt (not shown) to get net asset value. Assets\nminus debt equal equity, where the 'net' in NAV means net of debt. The final\nstep is to divide NAV into common shares to get NAV per share, which is an\nestimate of intrinsic value. In theory, the quoted share price should not\nstray too far from the NAV per share.\nWhen picking stocks, you sometimes hear of top-down versus bottom-up analysis.\nTop-down starts with an economic perspective and bets on themes or sectors\n(for example, an aging demographic may favor drug companies). Bottom-up\nfocuses on the fundamentals of specific companies. REIT stocks clearly require\nboth top-down and bottom-up analysis.\nFrom a top-down perspective, REITs can be affected by anything that impacts\nthe supply of and demand for property. Population and job growth tend to be\nfavorable for all REIT types. Interest rates are, in brief, a mixed bag. A\nrise in interest rates usually signifies an improving economy, which is good\nfor REITs as people are spending and businesses are renting more space. Rising\ninterest rates tend to be good for apartment REITs as people prefer to remain,\nrenters, rather than purchase new homes. On the other hand, REITs can often\ntake advantage of lower interest rates by reducing their interest expenses and\nthereby increasing their profitability.\nCapital market conditions are also important, namely the institutional demand\nfor REIT equities. In the short run, this demand can overwhelm fundamentals.\nFor example, REIT stocks did quite well in 2001 and the first half of 2002\ndespite lackluster fundamentals, because money was flowing into the entire\nasset class.\nAt the individual REIT level, you want to see strong prospects for growth in\nrevenue, such as rental income, related service income, and FFO. You want to\nsee if the REIT has a unique strategy for improving occupancy and raising its\nrents. REITs typically seek growth through acquisitions, and further aim to\nrealize economies of scale by assimilating inefficiently run properties.\nEconomies of scale would be realized by a reduction in operating expenses as a\npercentage of revenue. But acquisitions are a double-edged sword. If a REIT\ncannot improve occupancy rates and/or raise rents, it may be forced into ill-\nconsidered acquisitions in order to fuel growth.\nAs mortgage debt plays a big role in equity value, it is worth looking at the\nbalance sheet. Some recommend looking at leverage, such as the debt-to-equity\nration. But in practice, it is difficult to tell when leverage has become\nexcessive. It is more important to weigh the proportion of fixed versus\nfloating-rate debt. In the current low-interest-rate environment, a REIT that\nuses only floating-rate debt will be hurt if interest rates rise.\nREITs are real estate companies that must pay out high dividends in order to\nenjoy the tax benefits of REIT status. Stable income that can exceed Treasury\nyields combines with price volatility to offer a total return potential that\nrivals small-capitalization stocks. Analyzing a REIT requires understanding\nthe accounting distortions caused by depreciation and paying careful attention\nto macroeconomic influences.\nReal Estate Investing\nReal Estate Investing\nReal Estate Investing\nReal Estate Investing\nReal Estate Investing\nReal Estate Investing\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/04/22/how-reits-could-destroy-the-gaming-industry.aspx", "content": "_Returns as of 3/31/2020_\n _Returns as of 3/31/2020_\nFounded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps\nmillions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts,\nbooks, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.\nClick here for The Motley Fool's resources on Coronavirus and the market.\n![](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F164809%2Fpenn-\nst-louis-image.jpg&w=700&op=resize)\nPenn National was the first to launch a gaming REIT, and there could be\nunintended consequences for the industry. Image source: PENN National.\nFinancial engineering is all the rage on Wall Street right now, and it's made\nits way to the gaming market. Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs,\nhave become a popular way to extract value from real-estate-rich gaming\ncompanies, and even the rumor of a REIT can send a company's shares soaring.\n **Penn National Gaming** (NASDAQ:PENN) was the first to launch a REIT when it\nspun off **Gaming and** **Leisure Properties** (NASDAQ:GLPI). Recently,\n**Caesars Entertainment** (NASDAQ:CZR) has proposed a REIT in the bankruptcy\nrestructuring of its subsidiary, and **Pinnacle Entertainment** (NYSE: PNK)\nhas talked about launching or selling to a REIT, even getting an offer from\nGLPI.\nBut REITs are a risky structure in gaming, separating the real estate assets\nfrom operations and putting their management in different hands. The two are\ntied at the hip, and long term, this may be a disaster for the gaming\nindustry.\nThe Las Vegas Strip as it used to look. Real estate is at the heart of The\nStrip.\n**Casinos are real estate**  \nIt may seem like a casino's operations and its real estate are two different\nthings, but the reality is that a casino's real estate is critical to its\noperations. If it wasn't, you wouldn't care whether you stayed at Bellagio, or\nacross the street at Bally's. If you've ever been to Las Vegas, however, you\nknow that those two resorts offer very different experiences.\nSo, what happens to a property when a casino operation's best interest is to\nbuild an addition, or demolish a portion of the resort, and the REIT's best\ninterest is not to make those changes? Splitting the real estate and the\ncasino operations into companies with different vested interests doesn't make\na lot of sense.\n **What happens when the lease expires?**  \nThe next complication comes when leases expire. Penn National has 15-year\nleases with Gaming and Leisure Properties, with a five-year extension option.\nAt the end of that lease, it will be beneficial for Penn National to negotiate\nthe lowest lease extension possible, while Gaming and Leisure Properties'\ninterest is to maximize the lease, from Penn National or someone else.\nIt would become even more complicated if a company like Gaming and Leisure\nProperties were to buy Pinnacle Entertainment's real estate. Could that just\nbecome a backdoor acquisition after the 20-year lease is completed?\n **What do I care about 20 years from now?**  \nThe problem with financial engineering like REITs is it highly values the\nshort-term interests of hedge funds and activists -- many of whom won't be\naround in a year or two -- over the long-term interest of the companies\nthemselves.\nReal estate is actually one of the biggest assets a gaming company has, and\nit's an essential piece of the companies' operations. So, why would you want\nsomeone else to own that valuable asset?\n **What happens when your biggest asset is gone?**  \nThe problems with selling real estate into a REIT won't be seen today, but\ncould spell trouble when the next recession hits. One of the reasons Caesars\nEntertainment, Penn National, and others survived the recession was because\nthey had real estate to use as collateral to obtain debt.\nIn a REIT situation, the operating companies would have to fund operations\nwithout the backing of real estate, and if revenue declines, they could see\nprofits and debt funding dry up. Instead of having a safety blanket like real\nestate to fall back on, companies could go bankrupt when the gaming industry\ngoes into a lull.\nIn my opinion, valuing the short-term interests of hedge funds and searching\nfor tax savings through REITs is a short-term value creator that could have\nterrible long-term consequences. Consider the downside next time your favorite\ngaming company talks about a REIT, because it's probably not as good an idea\nas they want you to think.\n\n\nStock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

U.S. listed\nREITs have an equity market capitalization of more than $1 trillion.\nREITs invest in a wide scope of real estate property types, including offices,\napartment buildings, warehouses, retail centers, medical facilities, data\ncenters, cell towers, infrastructure and hotels. Most REITs focus on a\nparticular property type, but some hold multiples types of properties in their\nportfolios.  \n  \nListed REIT assets are categorized into one of 13 property sectors.\nMost REITs operate along a straightforward and easily understandable business\nmodel: By leasing space and collecting rent on its real estate, the company\ngenerates income which is then paid out to shareholders in the form of\ndividends.

Their comparatively\nlow correlation with other assets also makes them an excellent portfolio\ndiversifier that can help reduce overall portfolio risk and increase returns.\nThese are the characteristics of REIT-based real estate investment.\nREITs' track record of reliable and growing dividends, combined with long-term\ncapital appreciation through stock price increases, has provided investors\nwith attractive total return performance for most periods over the past 45\nyears compared to the broader stock market as well as bonds and other assets.\nListed REITs are professionally managed, publicly traded companies that manage\ntheir businesses with the goal of maximizing shareholder value.

(Maybe you played a lot of\nMonopoly as a kid and relish the idea of receiving a stream of cash from\nsomeone checking into one of your rooms for the night.) If you are wealthy,\nyou can franchise a hotel concept directly from one of the major hospitality\ncompanies.\nUnfortunately, many business-class hotels cost somewhere between $2 and $15\nmillion. Luxury and upscale hotels can easily require $30 to $60 million or\nmore. Although most of this is traditionally financed with debt, the required\nequity down payment is still far beyond the realm of possibility for\npractically all investors.\nThe good news? These days, there is another way to invest in hotels. You can\npurchase hotel REITs in your brokerage account the same way you buy stocks,\nbonds, or mutual funds. First, though, let's back up and talk about REITs for\na moment. In case you've forgotten or have never studied them, a real estate\ninvestment trust, or REIT is a special type of corporation focused on\nacquiring and managing real estate and real estate related assets.\nOne of the things that differentiate REITs from ordinary corporations is that\nCongress made them exempt from corporate taxes provided several strict\nconditions are met, the most relevant of which is the distribution of at least\n90% of all of the profits in the form of cash \u200bdividends to stockholders. This\nmakes REITs highly sensitive to interest rate movements but also means they\ntend to offer much fatter dividend yields than their blue-chip stock\ncounterparts.\nThe downside? REIT distributions are not \"qualified dividends\" under the tax\ncode, meaning you'll be taxed as if they were ordinary income, not at the\nlower, more attractive dividend tax rates. Once you start building a\nsignificant portfolio, this can sometimes get you in trouble if you buy too\nmany through a Roth IRA, SEP-IRA, 401(k), or another tax shelter, as you might\ntrigger the Unrelated Business Income Tax or UBIT. That is a different\ndiscussion for a different day.\nJust as stocks in different industries and sectors have different risk\ncharacteristics, REITs vary significantly depending on the type of real estate\nproject in which they specialize.\nThis isn't news to real estate investors who are accustomed to acquiring\nproperty outright. As they know from first-hand experience, an apartment\nbuilding behaves very differently from an office building or storage units\nbased on the underlying economics, traditions, practices, laws, and forces at\nwork. But, it sometimes comes as a surprise to new investors acquiring real\nestate through publicly traded securities.\nThey don't understand that your _commercial office_ REIT might experience\ncyclical lease rates as it follows boom and bust cycles, whereas your\n_industrial warehouse_ REIT might be far more steady, as overcapacity can be\nshut down with minimal maintenance costs much more quickly than is possible\nwith something like an apartment building. It's the nature of the asset class.\nOne interesting sub-specialty in the real estate investment industry is the\nhotel REIT. As you can probably surmise from the name, hotel REITs focus on\ndeveloping, managing, acquiring, or financing hotels and hospitality-related\nproperties.\nThese can range from budget inns located on the side of forgotten highways and\nstate roads to five-diamond prestige resorts in some of the entertainment,\ngambling, and population capitals of the world. They can involve developing\nand owning the property, paying a third-party management team to handle the\nactual running of the hotel in exchange for a share of the revenue.\nThey can focus mostly on managing other people's hotel properties for a cut of\nrevenue. They can involve financing hotel projects, acting more like quasi-\nfixed income investments. **You absolutely must understand what it is you own\nor you're risking your hard-earned savings**.\nHotel REITs are notoriously volatile because hotel occupancy correlates with\ngeneral economic conditions, making them highly sensitive to expansion and\ncontraction. When a recession hits, businesses slash travel budgets, opting\nfor video conferencing or telephone calls instead. Families and organizations\npostpone vacations, staying closer to home.\nFor a hotel REIT, this frequently means cash flows dry up at the same time\nyields are rising, so you get dramatic declines in the value of the units or\nshares. Conversely, when things turnaround, cash flow sometimes explodes\nthrough the roof, so you get these skyrocketing payouts and market values.\nThey are very different from the stalwarts of the world that pump out money\nlike clockwork, generation after generation -- businesses like Colgate-\nPalmolive or Nestle. Let's look at a real-world illustration to demonstrate\nhow an actual hotel REIT works.\nHospitality Properties Trust is a hotel REIT that owns 291 hotels,\nencompassing 43,976 rooms or suites, as well as 185 owned or leased travel\ncenters. According to the SEC filings, these properties are located in 44\nstates in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.\nThe hotel REIT operates its hotel portfolio under a diversified collection of\nfranchise agreements, including Courtyard by Marriott, Candlewood Suites,\nResidence Inn by Marriott, Royal Sonesta, Sonesta, Staybridge Suites, Hyatt\nPlace, Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts, Wyndham Grand, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts,\nSonesta ES Suites, InterContinental Hotels & Resorts, Marriott Hotels and\nResorts, the Clift Hotel, Radisson Hotels & Resorts, TownePlace Suites by\nMarriott, Hawthorn Suites, Country Inns & Suites by Carlson, Holiday Inn\nHotels & Resorts, SpringHill Suites by Marriott, and Park Plaza Hotels &\nResorts.\nIn the boom years before the real estate collapse tanked the economy in the\nworst recession since the Great Depression, this hotel REIT generated fat\ndistributions for owners. In 2004, they received $2.88 cash per share; in\n2005, $2.89 cash per share; in 2006, $2.94 cash per share; in 2007, $3.03 cash\nper share; in 2008, $3.08 cash per share.\nWhen the financial world fell apart, though, hotel bookings fell off a cliff.\nBusiness conferences were canceled and cash distributions were decimated,\ndropping to $0.77 per share, a staggering decline of 75%. If you were relying\non that money to pay your bills, you suddenly found it had evaporated at the\nvery moment you needed it most.\nFoolishly selling their stakes (again, if you own a hotel REIT you should know\nthis is part and parcel of the ownership experience), the shares collapsed\nfrom a high of $51.50 in 2006 to a mere $6.90 in 2009. This 86.6% drop in the\nstock price was added insult to the injury of the severe cut in your passive\nincome.\nWhat happened to sophisticated investors who understood the nature of hotel\nREIT ownership? They sat on their proverbial behinds, watching the cash\ndistributions climb to $1.96 per share with a stock price of $32.46. Sure,\nit's nowhere near the good years, but for a fairly horrific measurement\nperiod, you slightly beat inflation after taxes, retaining your purchasing\npower.\nYou bought the real estate security 10 years ago, paying between $26.50 and\n$42.40 per share. Over that time, you collected $24.83 or so in cash\ndistributions. If you were smart and reinvested those dividends during the\ncrisis, they became what one financial academic has referred to as a \"return\naccelerator,\" making several hundred percentage points of profit on each check\nor deposit plowed back into buying additional shares due to the partial\nrecovery in market value.\nContrast that hotel REIT with something like an industrial REIT. Even with the\nworld falling apart, businesses don't want to vacate their warehouses,\nshipping facilities, and factories. Also, they are often (not always) able to\npay the lease contracts they legally owe even if the firm itself ultimately\ngoes bankrupt. During the same meltdown, an industrial REIT like EastGroup\nProperties didn't cut the dividend.\nThe stock fell from $48.54 to $24.58, a decline of only 49.36%, which wasn't\nmuch different than the stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage and the S&P 500! Given the flow-through nature of the securities, and\nhow that influences market value, it's incredibly impressive. Even more\nimpressive? The shares are actually at $59.32 right now, so you have a $10.78\nunrealized capital gain, or 22%+ on the stock itself on top of all of those\ndividends you've enjoyed.\nThere are four major ways you can strategically approach acquiring hotel REITs\nif you want to own them:\nIn any event, hotel REITs are not the faint of heart. If you don't know what\nyou are doing, tread lightly.\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24882249", "content": "We are unable to process your request at this time.\nIf this error continues, please contact JSTOR support.

Is this, as cheerleaders on both\nsides claim, the most consequential election in a generation, or will little\nchange? Will Barack Obama, if elected, soon find that Washington \u201cboils all\nthe hope out of him\u201d? Will John McCain find that once in the Oval Office the\nmaverick becomes a mouse?\nThe first answer is that, no matter which contender wins the prize, America\nwill tread a very different path from the gloomy one down which George Bush\nhas taken it. Both Mr McCain and Mr Obama set greater store by multilateral\norganisations and the value of partnership than Mr Bush has done. Either would\nclose the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, that standing insult to civilised global\nvalues, and either would sign America up for some form of climate-control\nagreement. Either would find himself travelling a good deal more than the\nembattled Mr Bush has done, not least because they will be assured of a much\nmore sympathetic welcome\u2014though there is no doubt that Mr Obama would get the\nwarmer one.\nAt home, either presidency would differ markedly from Mr Bush's dismal last\nfew years during which, all political capital squandered, he has been unable\nto get anything of consequence done. If Mr McCain is in charge, his record of\nbipartisan outreach will stand him in good stead; Mr Obama will be able to\nrely on solid majorities in Congress. So either man seems better equipped than\nMr Bush was to break through the partisan logjam that bedevils America's\npolitics.\nThe second conclusion is that it really does matter who is chosen. Sharp\ncontrasts distinguish the two men both in philosophy and in policy. These are\nstarkest in the domestic arena. Mr McCain is at heart a classical economic\nliberal who favours big tax cuts, a simpler tax code, minimal government\nintervention and enthusiastic use of the veto pen. Mr Obama has a fondness for\ncomplicated subsidies and targeted tax breaks, and an underlying belief in the\npower of government to improve things. His tax cuts would lessen the burden on\nthe average worker, rather than the entrepreneur and business: the central\nbenchmark for his policies will be an improvement in America's stagnant median\nwage. Mr McCain's economic plans are more clearly focused on promoting overall\ngrowth.\nThe biggest difference between the two men's domestic policies is not on the\neconomy, but on health care. Mr Obama is determined to move America to near-\nuniversal coverage, and Mr McCain is not: he hopes to drive down overall costs\nthrough promoting more competition. Voters strongly prefer the Obama version;\nbut it will be pricey. And money is tight.\nWhoever wins, America will tread a very different path from the gloomy one\ndown which George Bush has taken it\nOn foreign policy, the candidates are closer than is often supposed. On all\npast and present form, Mr McCain would be gruffer towards Russia and China\nthan Mr Obama, but the younger man is not about to roll over for either one.\nOver Iraq there are huge divides in theory; but in practice either man is\nlikely to conduct a gradual withdrawal over the next two or three years. There\nare some large differences, though: Mr McCain wants a much bigger increase in\nmilitary spending than Mr Obama does, and on any reasonable assessment, he is\nmore likely to use force, if diplomacy fails, to counter Iran's nuclear\nambitions.\nWith all this at stake, it would be sad if the election turned on divisive\ncultural issues like abortion, where the chances of resolution are slim.\n\u201cValues\u201d could yet tip the balance. Though Mr Obama shows signs of pulling\nahead, this is still is a close election, with Mr McCain's advantage on\nsecurity countering Mr Obama's on the economy. But with the markets still\nreeling, we think the winner is likely to be the man who shows he best\nunderstands and can help the anxious average American.

A service of the National Library of Medicine, National\nInstitutes of Health.\nInstitute of Medicine (US) Committee on Dietary Guidelines Implementation;\nThomas PR, editor. Improving America's Diet and Health: From Recommendations\nto Action. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 1991.\nWHO SHOULD implement the growing consensus on dietary recommendations?\nGovernments exist to provide for the common good and the welfare of their\ncitizens\u2014and by extension the public's nutritional health. Therefore,\ngovernments at all levels have special obligations to implement dietary\nrecommendations both by example and by the unique actions that they can take.\nGovernments at all levels can promote implementation directly through\nlegislation and rule-making; provision of information and education; awarding\nof research and demonstration grants; intramural research, education, and\nextension programs; food assistance and farm programs; their own vast meal\nservice functions; and through acting as role models by providing examples of\nimplementation in government facilities, by government officials, and at\ngovernment-funded events. The public sector can also encourage this effort\nindirectly by setting an agenda for the implementation of various strategies,\ninitiating dialogue with the private sector and voluntary organizations, and\ncoordinating implementation efforts. This array of efforts must be pursued in\nthe legislative and executive branches at federal, state, and local levels.\nThe committee focuses here on the role of the federal government, but it\nshould be emphasized that many of the committee's recommendations are\napplicable at state and local levels as well. Moreover, it will be necessary\nfor those who are intimately aware of the special characteristics of each\nlocal situation to apply them. Involvement by state and local governments as\nwell as other societal sectors discussed in this report is essential if\nimplementation is to become a reality.\nThroughout this chapter, reference is made to government activities under way\nto encourage people to eat healthful diets. These activities include provision\nof qualitative advice as found in _Dietary Guidelines for Americans_\n(USDA/DHHS, 1980, 1985, 1990) (hereinafter referred to as the _Dietary\nGuidelines_ report) and quantitative recommendations from the National\nCholesterol Education Program (NCEP, 1990) and in the report _Healthy People\n2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives_ (DHHS,\n1990a). The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued suggestions to state\nschool food service directors on ways to implement the _Dietary Guidelines_ in\ntheir school lunch programs (see, for example, USDA, 1983). In addition,\nstudies on human nutrition related to the _Dietary Guidelines_ report have\nbeen undertaken by USDA (1987) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n(NIH, 1989).\nBut there are formidable barriers to implementing dietary recommendations in\nthe public sector, including politics, bureaucracy, and costs. The political\nobstacles to change include pressures from food producers, processors,\ndistributors, retailers, and industry, and other interest groups who believe\nthey would be adversely affected economically if dietary patterns were to\nchange or if current food service functions were required to offer options\nthat they believe would be less acceptable to consumers, although more\ndesirable from the standpoint of dietary recommendations. Government farm\nsubsidies can exacerbate the situation by encouraging the production of less\ndesirable food alternatives. Cost is a major factor when nutritionally\ndesirable foods are more expensive than alternative products.\nNone of these barriers is easily overcome. First, the outside pressures and\nthe bureaucratic and economic barriers to change must be acknowledged by\ngovernments at all levels. Second, current practices and activities that could\nbe modified to foster implementation need to be identified, modified\nappropriately, and the benefits of such change evaluated. Plans for achieving\neach of these steps should be developed in cooperation with all those who are\ninfluenced by, or have a special interest in, the outcomes. Development of\nthese goals and plans will require patience, political skills, and good will\non the part of public officials and others involved in the political process.\nOne example of such a successful effort was the preparation of the report\n_Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Pre_ _vention\nObjectives_ (DHHS, 1990a). These national objectives were formulated through a\npublic process that involved federal, state, and local governments as well as\nprivate and voluntary groups. The objectives were also published in draft form\nfor public comment (DHHS, 1989). Such open and inclusive processes are needed\nin developing nutrition policy to ensure support by all sectors.\nIt is desirable that initiatives to implement dietary recommendations in the\npublic sector adhere to a set of principles. These principles, described\nbelow, were developed by the committee to help public institutions make\nnutritionally desirable food choices available, identifiable, and acceptable.\nThese principles have also been applied in devising many of the committee's\nother recommendations described in Chapters 6 through 8.\nGovernments must initiate and participate in comprehensive programs to inform\nconsumers about dietary recommendations and about ways to integrate them into\neating patterns. For example, government cafeterias should provide information\nthat identifies eating patterns that conform to dietary recommendations. In\naddition, consumers should be given advice on how to follow the principles of\nthe recommendations wherever they eat; and food producers, processors,\ndistributors, and retailers should be advised on how to make the\nrecommendations apply at, for example, farms, processing plants, supermarkets,\nand eating facilities. Private-and voluntary-sector participation in similar\nactivities is essential.\nCoercion in food choices is rarely acceptable, especially for people who are\ninstitutionalized in government facilities or who are otherwise dependent on\nthe government for their basic economic support. Thus, although information on\ndietary recommendations and menus conforming to their principles should be\noffered, selection should be as much as possible the responsibility of each\nindividual. When government agencies formulate eating patterns and develop\nmenus to implement dietary recommendations in food assistance and other\nprograms, every attempt must be made to ensure that the cost of the\nrecommended diet does not appreciably exceed the alternatives.\nExperience with clinical dietetics, clinical trials, and community-based\nintervention studies has shown that incremental change is the most successful\nway to achieve long-term dietary adherence (see Chapter 3). Thus, to fully\nimplement dietary recommendations without major disruptions to the food system\nor people's current eating preferences, incremental changes will need to be\nencouraged over years or decades\u2014not weeks or months. Food producers,\nprocessors, marketers, and caterers should be strongly encouraged to initiate\nincremental changes conforming to the principles of dietary recommendations\nover a 5- to 10-year schedule. More rapid change is, of course, desirable and\nshould be attempted when feasible.\nThe special obligation of governments to implement dietary recommendations\nextends beyond education and the provision and coordination of information. It\nalso involves ensuring that every U.S. citizen has access to the foods that\ncan be used to meet these recommendations. In all government food-service\noperations and in dining areas in all government-supported institutions, foods\nshould be offered that can be used to meet dietary recommendations, thereby\nproviding an example for the private sector. Consumers should be given menu\nchoices, but among those choices there should be at least one that is\nidentified as helping people to meet dietary recommendations. When\nalternatives cannot be made available, the set menu should be one that helps\npeople meet dietary recommendations.\nDietary changes are adjuncts to, not substitutes for, a comprehensive system\nof health promotion, disease prevention, disease treatment, nutrition support,\nand social welfare measures, including economic and food assistance. Because\ngovernmental institutions have a special obligation to provide access to the\nbasic needs of daily life and health, they should present good eating patterns\nas one of many life-style factors, such as cessation of smoking, reducing\nblood pressure, achieving ideal body weight, lowering serum cholesterol, and\nincreasing physical activity, that can decrease chronic disease risk.\nPublic officials at all levels of governments should work with representatives\nof interest groups in the public, private, and voluntary sectors to implement\ndietary recommendations. Collaborative efforts are likely to be most\nsuccessful when many different people support the change and believe that\ntheir efforts will turn out favorably for them.\nFood plans designed to meet dietary recommendations must be made appealing to\nconsumers in order to be accepted. The committee recognizes that the\npopulation's taste preferences may gradually shift with increasing exposure to\nmeals that help it to meet dietary recommendations, but menu revisions must\nconsider people's present food preferences. In addition, the palatability and\nacceptability of menus based on the principles of dietary recommendations\nshould be tested in target populations for prolonged periods (i.e., weeks or\nmonths, not days). Health-promoting meals must be at least as appealing as the\nmeals they are replacing.\nHealth-promoting meals should be relatively convenient in comparison with\ncurrent offerings with regard to purchasing, preparation, delivery, and\nconsumption. Any proposed menus (especially _least-cost_ menus and food plans)\nbased on the principles of dietary recommendations should be tested in\npopulations to ensure that they are acceptably convenient and appealing before\nbeing disseminated. Planning, preparing, and perhaps serving new menus may be\nless convenient at first, but will become more routine over time.\nFoods rather than vitamin and mineral supplements should serve as the sole\nsources of nutrients to meet dietary recommendations in government food\nprograms. It would not be acceptable to this committee were the government to\nsuggest as a cost-cutting measure the use of dietary supplements or their\nequivalent (highly fortified products) instead of the planning of menus which\nmeet, or come close to meeting, the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (see\nChapter 4).\nIn implementing dietary recommendations, menus and meal plans that entail the\nfewest disruptions to current food preferences are preferable. In addition,\nchoices within food groups should be preserved whenever possible.\nOccasionally, however, consumers may need to make major changes in food\npreferences. The key to success in these cases is mapping out gradual changes\nand providing the needed transition period.\nThe committee developed five strategies and associated actions to assist\ngovernments at all levels in promoting the nutritional health and welfare of\nthe public.\n **STRATEGY 1: Improve federal efforts to implement dietary recommendations.**\nThe full potential benefits of implementing dietary recommendations can be\napproached by a federally coordinated effort, collaboration with state and\nlocal governments, and participation of the private sector, professional and\nvoluntary organizations, and consumer advocacy and community groups. The\ncommittee recognizes that the federal government has done much to encourage\nAmericans to eat well; many of these activities are mentioned in this report.\nFor example, it has prepared and distributed many reports and consumer\ninformation materials on diet and health (see, for example, NCI/NHLBI, 1988,\nand USDA, 1981, 1984, 1986b,c, 1988a, 1989a). In addition, governmentwide\ninteragency committees were formed to coordinate activities related to\nnutrition monitoring and human nutrition research. Within USDA and the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), subcommittees serve as\ndepartmental focal points for coordinating the preparation and dissemination\nof information and publications and for providing technical assistance on\ndietary guidance. To date, however, there is no governmentwide nutrition\npolicy that provides a coherent blueprint for fostering healthful dietary\npatterns.\n _ACTION 1: The executive branch should establish a coordinating mechanism\nthat would promote the implementation of dietary recommendations._\nThe executive branch has taken steps to coordinate many of its nutrition-\nrelated activities by establishing specific inter-and intra-agency groups. The\nInteragency Committee on Human Nutrition Research, which coordinates\ngovernment-sponsored nutrition research, is cochaired by an assistant\nsecretary from both USDA and DHHS; it includes representatives from USDA,\nDHHS, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Agency for International\nDevelopment (AID), National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National\nScience Foundation, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (DVA). The Interagency Committee on Nutrition\nMonitoring, which works to enhance the effectiveness and productivity of\nfederal nutrition monitoring efforts, is also cochaired by an assistant\nsecretary from both USDA and DHHS. It consists of representatives of USDA,\nDHHS, AID, DOD, DVA, Bureau of the Census, and the Department of Labor.\nBecause most nutrition-related activities of the federal government take place\nin USDA and DHHS, both departments have established administrative structures\nto ensure that food and nutrition information emanating from their various\nagencies are consistent with the _Dietary Guidelines_ report (U.S. Congress,\nHouse, 1989b). The Dietary Guidance Working Group at USDA, established in\n1986, is composed of representatives of at least eight USDA agencies (e.g.,\nthe Cooperative Extension Service, the Human Nutrition Information Service,\nand the National Agricultural Library) (USDA, 1986a). Similarly, the Nutrition\nPolicy Board Subcommittee on Dietary Guidance in DHHS, established in 1987,\nconsists of representatives from the NIH, the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (DHHS, 1990b; U.S. Congress,\nHouse, 1989b). Each group has a liaison representative from the other agency\nto promote consistent and complementary messages on dietary guidance.\nIn two important respects, however, the federal government's efforts to\nimplement dietary recommendations are insufficient. First, the charters of the\ninteragency coordinating committees restrict them to narrow areas. The four\nadministrative structures described above are not empowered to assume\nresponsibility for implementing dietary recommendations, an effort that\ninvolves much more than providing information on diet and health, conducting\nnutrition research, and monitoring the nutritional status of the food supply\nand U.S. population. Secondly, these four groups are frequently criticized for\nfailing to fulfill their narrowly-defined missions. For example, there is\nstill no comprehensive nutrition surveillance system in place to adequately\nmonitor trends in dietary intake, determine the nutritional status and\nknowledge of the population (particularly among high-risk minority groups and\nthe disadvantaged and homeless), and report results in a timely fashion\n(Nestle, 1990). Government publications on diet and health too often are not\navailable in ample quantities at the community level or may be too expensive\nfor many people to purchase. In addition, little priority may be given to the\ndissemination of these materials by the local agencies that sponsor\nimplementation activities.\nThe lack of a coordinating mechanism at the federal level to implement dietary\nrecommendations has had unfortunate consequences. In some cases, nutrition\npolicy decisions are made in a fragmented manner that can result in policies\nthat are inconsistent from a public health perspective. Federal policies on\nalcohol, farm subsidies for some commodities, and means of grading and payment\nfor certain commodities (e.g., by fat content) are examples.\nThe heads of the agencies with responsibilities in food and nutrition need to\nestablish a suitable mechanism to ensure that all their policies and programs\ndirectly or indirectly related to these areas are compatible with the\nprinciples of dietary recommendations. The mechanism will need to (1)\ncoordinate government efforts to implement dietary recommendations, (2)\nmaximize each agency's independent ability to promote these recommendations,\n(3) establish consistent food and nutrition policies across government\nagencies, and (4) initiate and encourage collaborative efforts between\ngovernment and outside agencies (including the states, the private sector, and\nvoluntary groups).\nThe committee suggests that the executive branch consider establishing a\nsingle, high-level entity to coordinate and direct government nutrition\nactivities. This was proposed as early as 1969 at the White House Conference\non Food, Nutrition, and Health (White House, 1970). As an example, a committee\ncould be established for this purpose, composed of a very senior-level person\nfrom each of the eight relevant cabinet-level departments (Agriculture,\nCommerce, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Interior, State, and\nVeterans Affairs). The representatives would have a small professional and\nsupport staff and major responsibilities in their departments for some aspect\nof the food system or for feeding people.\n _ACTION 2: Encourage members of the U.S. Congress and state legislative\nbodies to play active roles in the implementation of dietary recommendations._\nLegislative bodies have special opportunities and responsibilities to devote\nsome of their attention, interest, insights, and expertise on matters that\naffect the diet and health of their constituents. Many members of the U.S.\nCongress are becoming more cognizant of the key role that dietary patterns\nplay in the general well-being of the public. Bills introduced in Congress\npertaining to food and nutrition cover a broad range of activities and include\nlegislation to reauthorize food assistance programs and legislation related to\nfood labeling, nutrition monitoring, nutrition research, commodity food\ndistribution programs, health promotion and disease prevention programs, and\neducation and training programs.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress can assist in efforts to implement dietary\nrecommendations in the various agencies through oversight hearings,\nauthorizations and appropriations, conference report language, and other\nlegislative actions. Support from the legislative branch will encourage high-\nlevel administrators in the executive branch departments to give priority and\nresources to dietary recommendations in policy guidelines, technical\nassistance programs, education and information initiatives, and other\nactivities addressing the food, nutrition, and health needs of consumers.\nThe farm bill, which comes before Congress every 4 to 5 years, should be\nreviewed and revised with dietary recommendations in mind. Nutrition\neducators, registered dietitians, physicians, and other health-care\nprofessionals, working through their associations, should advise Congress\nduring these periodic reviews. The 1990 farm bill is a landmark piece of\nlegislation that mandates policies and programs governing many areas relevant\nto dietary recommendations: (1) extending and revising agricultural price\nsupport and related programs (e.g., for milk and sugar); (2) providing for\nagricultural export, resource conservation, farm credit, agricultural\nresearch, and related programs (e.g., human nutrition research, extension\nservice, and land-grant institutions); (3) continuing certain food assistance\nprograms to low-income people (e.g., food stamps and commodity distribution\nprograms); and (4) ensuring consumers an abundance of food at reasonable\nprices (e.g., through commodity promotion, research, and information) (U.S.\nCongress, House, 1990; U.S. Congress, Senate, 1990).\nState legislatures have many opportunities to promote the implementation of\ndietary recommendations. In September 1989, for example, California enacted\nlegislation (Assembly Bill No. 2109) mandating its State Department of\nEducation to ''develop and maintain nutrition guidelines for school lunches\nand breakfasts, and for all food and beverages sold on public school campuses\"\n(California Legislature, 1989, p. 3). These \"guidelines shall include\nguidelines for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and shall specify that\nwhere comparable food products of equal nutritional value are available the\nfood product lower in fat, or saturated fat, or cholesterol shall be used\" (p.\n3).\n **STRATEGY 2: Alter federal programs that directly influence what Americans\neat so as to encourage rather than impede the implementation of dietary\nrecommendations. This effort should affect food assistance, food safety, and\nnutrition programs, as well as farm subsidy, tariff, and trade programs.**\nThe primary federal food assistance programs are administered by USDA and DHHS\ntogether with state governments and local agencies. Two nutrition services for\nolder Americans (congregate meals and home-delivered meals) are administered\nat the federal level by DHHS; others (e.g., the Food Stamp Program, School\nLunch and Breakfast programs, the Child Care Food and Summer Food Service\nprograms, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and\nChildren [WIC]) fall under the jurisdiction of USDA. State departments of\neducation usually have responsibility for food programs serving children in\nschools, child-care centers, and summer recreation centers. State departments\nof health, welfare, and agriculture usually have responsibility for programs\nproviding food stamps or supplemental foods to families or individuals. The\nmeals programs for elderly people are administered by state and area agencies\non aging.\nThe potential for reaching vast numbers of the country's citizens who receive\nbenefits through these programs is tremendous. For example, the School Lunch\nProgram serves lunch to 24 million children each day, about half of them from\nlow-income families (U.S. Congress, House, 1989a). At present, the nutritional\nstandard for meals served under this program is limited to the requirement\nthat they meet one-quarter to one-third of the RDAs (NRC, 1989b) over time\nthrough the choice of foods within a prescribed meal pattern.\nThe committee recommends that nutrition guidelines for this and all other food\nassistance programs be tied to dietary recommendations in a practical fashion.\nParticipants in these programs should be able, if they desire, to eat diets\nthat meet dietary recommendations in the normal course of their day-to-day\nliving and not only by extraordinary effort. They should be able to receive\nappealing and easy-to-understand educational materials (of appropriate levels\nof comprehension and cultural sensitivity) about dietary recommendations and\nhow to improve their eating habits with the help of the foods supplied by\nvarious assistance programs.\n _ACTION 1: Revise current USDA regulations governing the child and family\nnutrition programs to comply with dietary recommendations and train federal,\nregional, state, and local personnel administering the programs to implement\nthe recommendations._\nMany implementation efforts can be achieved without legislative or regulatory\nchanges, while others require changes in laws and regulations. The committee's\nrecommendation to ensure that nutrition programs adhere to dietary\nrecommendations is one that requires statutory and regulatory change. For\nexample, while only the School Lunch Program must offer students whole milk\n_and_ at least one of the following: low-fat milk, skim milk, or buttermilk,\nthe other child nutrition programs (e.g., the Special Milk, School Breakfast,\nSummer Food Service, and Child Care Food programs) require only that milk be\nfluid and pasteurized and that it meet state and local standards. It may be\nunflavored or flavored whole milk, low-fat milk, skim milk, or cultured\nbuttermilk. The committee supports requirements that options be made\navailable, with the caveat that low-fat and skim milk not be served to infants\nand children under age 2 without direction by a pediatrician (see Chapter 4).\nTo ensure that government nutrition programs adhere to dietary\nrecommendations, it will also be necessary to provide training and other forms\nof technical assistance to those who administer the programs. Designers of\ntraining programs must recognize that the United States has a very\ndecentralized, heterogeneous, multiethnic, multicultural system, which makes\nimplementation difficult. Managers and cooks in all child and family food\nassistance programs should be trained in all critical aspects of food\npreparation and services. At a minimum, they should be taught menu planning,\nfood purchasing, food preparation, and service techniques that support dietary\nrecommendations. Governments must encourage private-sector contributions to\nsuch training programs.\nThe WIC food packages for women and children from age 2 and older should be\nreviewed for conformance with the principles of dietary recommendations.\nFruits, vegetables, whole-grain products, and legumes should be included\nwhenever possible. The committee recognizes that uniformity and cost issues\nmust be addressed in modifying the WIC package. Relevant government agencies\nworking with WIC nutritionists should prepare information and educational\nmaterials for WIC recipients on healthful ways of feeding their families to\nmeet dietary recommendations. These materials should include caveats\nconcerning the applicability of these recommendations to infants and children\nunder age 2 and should address special issues (e.g., alcohol consumption)\nrelated to the health of pregnant and lactating women.\nFood Stamp Program allotments are based on the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan,\na nutritionally adequate set of food allowances developed by USDA for people\nof very limited financial means (Cleveland and Kerr, 1988). However, the\ncommittee believes that many low-income families lack the money (owing to\nother high fixed costs like shelter and transportation); food planning,\npurchasing, and preparation skills; and knowledge of food and nutrition to\nfollow the Thrifty Food Plan so as to ensure the consumption of nutritionally\nadequate diets that meet dietary recommendations. The committee believes that\ndietary change in healthful directions would probably be fostered among low-\nincome families if food stamp allotments were to be based on a more generous\nstandard, such as USDA's Low-Cost Food Plan. This plan is approximately 20%\ngreater in cost than the Thrifty Food Plan and would enable the purchase of a\ngreater variety of foods. Recently, the American Dietetic Association\nrecommended that food stamp allotments be based on USDA's Moderate-Cost Food\nPlan (Hinton et al., 1990), which is 40% more costly than the Thrifty Food\nPlan.\n _ACTION 2: Revise current regulations governing the Nutrition Program for\nOlder Americans (which provides congregate meals and home-delivered meals) to\nconform to the principles of dietary recommendations and train federal,\nregional, state, and local personnel administering the programs accordingly._\nAging is accompanied by a variety of changes that can compromise nutritional\nstatus (DHHS, 1988a,b). These changes may be physiologic (e.g., decrease in\nsense of smell and dental problems), psychologic (e.g., depression), economic\n(e.g., declines in income), and social (e.g., living alone or in an\ninstitution). Elderly people who consume diets that meet dietary\nrecommendations will reduce their risks of developing many degenerative\nchronic diseases, especially if they have eaten well in the past and engage in\nother health-promoting behaviors.\nGeneral principles for training cooks and other food service personnel\ndescribed in other sections of this report also apply here. In addition, menu\nplans for the nutrition programs that feed elderly people should (1) be\nethnically and biologically appropriate for the low-energy intakes\ncharacteristic of this group; (2) be appropriate for, and adaptable to, the\nphysical and biological limitations of elderly people in preparing their food;\nand (3) be compatible with dietary and drug therapies (e.g., should not lead\nto adverse drug-nutrient interactions, which are common among the elderly).\nThe fact that most elderly people have limited incomes and live in small\nfamilies also should be taken into account.\nThe nutritionist's position at the Administration on Aging's (AOA) central\noffice in DHHS has remained unfilled for nearly a decade. This position was\nand is vital for implementing standards and providing technical assistance to\nnutrition programs for elderly people. The committee believes that this\nimportant position must be restored and the office fully staffed. The AOA\nneeds a nutrition adviser at the federal level to assist its program\noperations with implementation of dietary recommendations.\nThe nutrition-related recommendations resulting from the Surgeon General's\nWorkshop on Aging (DHHS, 1988b) as well as some of the specific nutrition-\nrelated programs at DHHS on healthy aging need to be implemented. Coordination\nbetween offices in USDA and DHHS (e.g., NIH, AOA, and CDC) and private-sector\ncoalitions will be needed to accomplish this. The major goal is to emphasize\nhealthful eating in the context of overall health promotion, disease\nprevention, and disease treatment.\nThe committee urges those segments of the private sector involved in providing\nfood for food assistance and other government programs to take an offensive\nrather than a defensive stand in implementing dietary recommendations.\nProducers and distributors must more actively consider these recommendations\nin developing new and modified foods for the elderly and for those who are\npart of other food assistance programs.\n _ACTION 3: USDA and DHHS should ensure that food and health programs serving\nall special populations conform to dietary recommendations._\nSeveral food assistance programs serve many special populations, including\nNative Americans and those of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. As an\nexample, the two largest programs serving Indians are the Food Stamp Program\n(FSP) and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). As an\nalternative to food stamps, FDPIR provides commodity foods to eligible\nhouseholds located on reservations. Because of high unemployment rates and low\nincomes, the federal programs are the major source of food in many of these\nhouseholds. Reservations are often located in remote areas of the country\nwhere lands are not suitable for farming. As a result, many tribes cannot\nprovide all their own food, especially when economic resources are limited.\nFrom 1988 through 1990, the GAO investigated the effectiveness of public and\nprivate programs in alleviating hunger and promoting the nutritional welfare\nof residents on Indian reservations. In their two reports to Congress on this\nmatter (GAO, 1989, 1990), GAO stated that four major diet-related health\nconditions existed on the reservations studied: obesity, diabetes, heart\ndisease, and hypertension. It also noted that \"Although USDA improved the\nnutritional content of the FDPIR food package in 1986, tribal and . . . Indian\nHealth Service . . . officials believe that the fat and sodium content of many\nof the available food items should be reduced further\" (GAO, 1989, p. 4).\nFurthermore, it stated, \"Food assistance programs can improve diets on Indian\nreservations by making available more nutritious foods and nutrition\neducation\" (p. 6).\nThe important role of nutrition education to ensure that FDPIR and FSP\nrecipients get help with their dietary needs also was mentioned in the GAO\nreports. The committee urges the federal government to keep this in mind when\nestablishing priorities and time frames for upgrading the nutritional quality\nof commodities to meet dietary recommendations. The importance of the cultural\nrelevance and compatibility with the concept of gradual change cannot be\noveremphasized in the implementation of this action. The committee also\nsupports the provision of greater resources to the Indian Health Services in\nits work to decrease morbidity in the Native American population.\n _ACTION 4: Ensure that the education and information components of the\nforegoing federal food assistance and nutrition programs are consistent with\ndietary recommendations._\nEach of the previously mentioned food assistance and nutrition programs does\nor should have a nutrition education component. The committee recommends that\nhigher priority be given to implementing dietary recommendations in education\nprograms throughout the United States. Suggestions for improving nutrition\neducation are found in Chapters 7 and 8.\nThe USDA's Nutrition Education and Training (NET) Program, if adequately\nfunded (see Chapter 8), could provide ample opportunity to accomplish this\naction for schoolchildren. Each fiscal year, the state education agencies must\nsubmit a plan for their NET programs for approval by the USDA. They base their\nplans on an ongoing assessment and evaluation of the plans from previous\nyears. Some of the activities that should be built into the NET Program plan\nof each state include reaching all children in the state with information on\ndiet and health, providing in-service training for school food-service\nmanagement personnel, offering teacher training in nutrition, and\ndisseminating information to school officials and parents. Some states, such\nas Texas, have evaluated the effectiveness of their NET Program (Roberts-Gray,\n1987). The committee encourages such action, especially after dietary\nrecommendations have been integrated into state plans and programs.\nA spring 1989 survey among a nationally representative, randomly selected\nsample of district school food-service directors revealed a great deal of\nuncertainty concerning the scientific consensus on daily fat intake levels.\nRespondents reported having limited access to written materials or training\nprograms explaining how to purchase (e.g., preparing specifications for\nsupplies) or modify recipes to reduce fat content. They also frequently\nmentioned the need for improved education and training to help lower the fat\ncontent of school meals (Shotland, 1989).\nAnother important government education program is the Expanded\nFood and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) of USDA's Cooperative Extension\nService, which was started in 1968 to help low-income families in all states,\nespecially those with young children, acquire the knowledge, skills,\nattitudes, and behavior changes necessary to improve their diets (Chipman and\nKendall, 1989). In 1970, the program was extended to serve low-income youths\nin the 4-H Program. These youths are taught nutrition-related skills, enabling\nthem to improve the adequacy of their diets. EFNEP home economists provide on-\nthe-job training and supervise paraprofessionals and volunteers who teach the\nlow-income homemakers and youths. The paraprofessionals often live in the\ncommunities where they work and enroll homemakers in individual or group\nteaching sessions (USDA, 1984).\nEthnically appropriate materials (e.g., food and nutrition information\ntailored to cultural subgroups) should be made more available to guide food\nselection in accord with the principles of dietary recommendations. The\ncommittee recognizes that money and other resources must be provided and that\ncreative ways need to be devised to make these materials available to\nconsumers.\nOutreach efforts for many public assistance programs can assist in the\ndissemination of information on diet and health to low-income families in\nevery county of the nation. Full funding on a continuing basis plus a high-\npriority status conferred at the departmental level is needed if these\nprograms are to fulfill their mandate and keep the country's citizenry\ninformed of new knowledge about diet and health.\n _ACTION 5: Incorporate dietary recommendations into current rules and\nregulations governing commodity purchases._\nTo stabilize the prices that farmers and ranchers receive for many of the\nfoods they produce, the federal government purchases the surplus production\nand distributes such commodities at no or low cost to several food assistance\nprograms. About 30% of the value of all foods purchased for school meals comes\nfrom surplus food commodities donated to schools by USDA or purchased by them\nat reduced prices (USDA, 1989b). Because many food-service directors rely\nheavily on government commodities to help them stretch their food budgets, the\nnutritional quality of school meals can depend greatly on the types of\ncommodities received. In addition, numerous emergency food programs across the\nUnited States depend on government surplus food commodities provided through\nthe Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program.\nUSDA has already taken a number of steps to make commodity foods more\ncompatible with the principles of dietary recommendations. Efforts have been\nmade to lower fat content, restrict the use of highly saturated fat, provide\nwhole grains and fresh fruit, and to purchase lower-fat foods and commodities\nwith reduced levels of salt and sugar (USDA, 1989b). Despite these efforts, a\nnational survey by the advocacy group Public Voice for Food and Health Policy\nrevealed that school food-service directors view commodity foods as a real\nbarrier to implementing dietary recommendations (Shotland, 1989). Two-thirds\nof the directors identified USDA's Commodity Donation Programs as major\nobstacles to reducing fat in menus. Subsequently, Public Voice evaluated\nschool lunch programs in schools across the country to assess the availability\nof low-fat options (Morris, 1990). It concluded that \"too much fat is being\noffered our children in school lunches\" (p. 2) and made recommendations for\nimprovement. The Citizens Commission on School Nutrition (1990) recently\nissued a report with recommendations for improving the nutritional quality of\nthe school lunch program.\nThe committee recommends that USDA continue its efforts to bring the nation's\ndonated and surplus foods programs into closer compliance with the principles\nof dietary recommendations whenever possible. For example, the programs might\ntry to include more whole-grain products, fruits and vegetables, low-fat\nrather than high-fat cheeses, lean rather than high-fat meat, poultry,\nlegumes, and low-sodium products. Health-care professionals in communities\ncould advise local food-service directors about foods to purchase that would\nnutritionally complement the commodities received, enabling the preparation of\nmenus that help people to meet dietary recommendations.\nDietary recommendations should be a consideration in specifying and awarding\nprocessing contracts between the agencies distributing or receiving donated\nand surplus foods and processors, who convert the donated foods into finished\nitems such as pastas and bread. Contracts should specify the nutritional\nprofile of the end product and the amount and proportion of its ingredients.\nThe committee believes that dietary recommendations should serve as an\nimportant specification in these contracts.\n **STRATEGY 3: Change laws, regulations, and agency practices that have an\nappreciable but indirect impact on consumer dietary choices so that they make\nmore foods to support nutritionally desirable diets available. Examples are\nfood grading and labeling laws and standards of identity for a number of food\nproducts.**\n _ACTION 1: Improve food labeling and food description, production, and\nprocessing regulations to permit consumers to make better informed choices._\nConsumers cannot make informed food choices unless they know how their dietary\npatterns contribute to health and risk of disease and how to improve their\ndiets. Without this knowledge, consumers cannot know whether they are meeting\ndietary recommendations or what kinds of dietary trade-offs they may need to\nmake so they can keep eating some favorite high-fat foods. Nutrition\ninformation provided on food labels is perhaps the most important and direct\nmeans of conveying such information.\nThe current framework for the nutrition labeling of foods in the United States\nwas established in 1973. Under current regulations, nutrition labeling is\nvoluntary for manufacturers, unless a nutrient is added or a nutritional claim\nis made for a product. Regulation of food labeling is currently shared by two\nfederal agencies: USDA for meat, poultry, and egg products and the FDA for all\nother foods. The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for food advertising\n(IOM, 1990). Among current concerns about food labeling are the proliferation\nof health claims, the lack of full nutrition labeling for macronutrients, the\nlimited extent to which foods are covered by labeling, and its complexity for\nmany consumers (see Chapter 8).\nThere is general consensus that food labels should be updated and modified to\nprovide consumers with important information to assist them in choosing\nhealthful diets. FDA and USDA have devoted considerable effort to studying the\nissues, drafting proposed modifications for the content and format of labels,\nand planning for reform. On July 19, 1990, for example, FDA proposed standard\nserving sizes for foods according to product category (Benton and Sullivan,\n1990), an action the committee applauds. Congress has also shown considerable\ninterest in food labeling by holding hearings, drafting legislation, and\npublicly calling for label improvements; it culminated in the passage of the\nNutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which was signed into law by the\nPresident in November 1990. The private sector and health-care professionals\nhave also contributed importantly to the debate and process of reform. A\nrecent report of the Food and Nutrition Board (IOM, 1990) provides a detailed\noverview of the U.S. system of food labeling and many recommendations to\nimprove it. This committee urges implementation of the recommendations in that\nreport as well as continued study of ways in which food labels can be used to\nimprove dietary patterns.\n _ACTION 2: Develop and adopt regulations governing food descriptions,\ngrading, and nomenclatural practices._\nThese regulations would relate to standards of identity and quality grades for\nproducts such as meat and milk. Appropriate federal agencies should support\nthe following three specific components of this action item:\n _A. Review standards of identity, changing or discontinuing them as\nappropriate. These standards should be consistent with and promote the\nprinciples of dietary recommendations._\nWith the intent to prevent economic fraud, the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic (FD&C) Act requires FDA to establish standards of identity that\ndefine the composition of certain foods. Under current provisions of the FD&C\nAct, it is very difficult to change a standard once it has been adopted (IOM,\n1990). Therefore, some standards have not kept up to date with advances in\nfood technology and nutrition. For example, fat was considered to be a\nvaluable component of food at the time that most standards were adopted, so\nstandards of identity for cheese are based largely on its fat content. A\ncheese product with lower fat than required by the standard must be named\nsomething other than cheese (although it need not be labeled \"imitation\" if it\nis not nutritionally inferior to the standardized food). Consumers may be less\nwilling to try products that do not have standardized names, even though some\nof them may fit more easily into diets meeting dietary recommendations. FDA\nhas sought comments on possible approaches to addressing problems with current\nfood standards and will address this area under its current food labeling\ninitiatives (Food Chemical News, 1990).\n _B. Review price supports for milk and examine the implications of increasing\nthe dollar value of the nonfat portion and reducing the dollar value of the\nbutterfat portion while keeping milk price constant._\nDairy products are a major food item in the U.S. diet, and there has been a\ngradual increase in the purchase of low-fat milk. If the population is to\nlower its fat intake to 30% or less of total caloric intake, more low-fat\ndairy products need to be made available. At present, however, the price for\nmilk paid to producers is based on the butterfat content. As an initial step\ntoward decreasing the butterfat content of milk, the committee recommends that\nUSDA study the economic implications to consumers and the dairy industry of\nincreasing the dollar value of the milk solids component and decreasing the\ndollar value of the fat component. Adjustments in the milk pricing system\nshould provide an impetus to dairy producers to start breeding, feeding, and\nmanaging their herds for decreased fat production (NDC, 1989).\n _C. Review and, if necessary, change quality grades of meat and develop\nuniform nomenclature for ground beef to make these products more compatible\nwith dietary recommendations._\nThe grading system for beef and lamb has rewarded fatty meat with appealing\ngrade names that encourages producers to fatten animals and deters them from\nproducing lean meat. The grades are a vestige of the time when well-marbled\nmeat meant better meat to consumers. The grading system needs to be reviewed\nin light of modern knowledge of diet and disease relationships. In 1987, a\npositive change in the U.S. grading system was the renaming of U.S. Good grade\nto U.S. Select (Clarke and Wise, 1988). By establishing a more positive grade\nname, the meat industry was given an opportunity to improve marketing of beef\nwith less marbling than that in the Prime or Choice grade. A similar\nbeneficial change is the action by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service\nto alter the Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS) for fresh beef\n(USDA, 1988b). IMPS are voluntary guidelines for cut definitions and trimming\npractices used by the meat industry to help standardize quality control\nprocedures. The IMPS now call for more fat to be trimmed from various cuts of\nbeef than was designated in the past. The external fat on cuts of beef such as\nsteak was reduced from one-half to one-quarter inch, and for the first time,\nthe term _practically free offat_ was quantified as meaning that at least 75%\nof lean meat is exposed on the surface of the cut.\nA national standard for grading and labeling lean ground beef should be\nadopted. Currently, individual states and supermarkets set their own standard\nfor _lean, very lean,_ and other terms to describe ground beef, and the actual\nfat content can vary considerably. This confuses consumers who are trying to\ndecrease the fat in their diets. National uniform standards for the fat\ncontent in ground beef should be developed.\n _ACTION 3: Improve the nutritional attributes of animal products._\n _In 1988, a committee of the National Research Council's Board on Agriculture\nreleased its report Designing Foods_ (NRC, 1988). Many of the policy and\nresearch recommendations to improve the nutritional attributes of animal foods\nare supportive of dietary recommendations (see Chapter 6). This committee\ntherefore suggests that governments review the report and adopt those\nrecommendations that have a direct impact on the implementation of dietary\nrecommendations.\n **STRATEGY 4: Enable government feeding facilities to serve as models to\nprivate food services and help people meet dietary recommendations.**\nIn their roles as major food-service providers, governments (especially the\nfederal government) have responsibilities to set a good example by offering\nmeals that help people to meet dietary recommendations. In addition to\ndeveloping implementation and demonstration projects, governments can exercise\ntheir leadership and educational roles by serving as models for the voluntary,\nprivate, and public sectors. Such projects can be instructive to key\ninstitutions in the country, including corporations, colleges and\nuniversities, correctional facilities, and hospitals. Through the efforts of\nthe secretary of DHHS, several federal government facilities might serve as\nmodel programs. The NIH Clinical Center, a ''showcase\" hospital, could make\nchanges in all nontherapeutic diets. The cafeteria in Building 31 on the NIH\ncampus in Bethesda, Maryland, serves the visiting biomedical community and\nhospital and would be an excellent locus for a model program that implements\ndietary recommendations. It is unrealistic to expect others to change when\ngovernment agencies (and private institutions that depend largely on federal\nfunding) do not do so themselves. The cafeteria in the Hubert H. Humphrey\nBuilding in downtown Washington, D.C., which serves high-ranking federal and\nother healthcare personnel, and the cafeterias of USDA have recently\nimplemented changes that are in accord with dietary recommendations and might\nserve as models to other government-managed eating places.\nSeveral issues associated with the implementation of dietary recommendations\nrequire further study. It is crucial to have information on technical problems\nthat might be experienced in demonstration projects (e.g., in private-,\nvoluntary-, and public-sector settings) in order to develop more effective\nimplementation strategies.\nIn the committee's judgment, two barriers confront the implementation of\nStrategy 4. Perhaps the most fundamental barrier is the lack of political\nwill. In the case of smoking, governments acknowledged the scientific evidence\nlinking the habit to heart disease, lung cancer, and other diseases and took\nactions to restrict or eliminate smoking in their facilities. The committee\nhopes that as governments become more convinced of the connections between\ndiet and health, they will become more active in implementing the principles\nof dietary recommendations in their own feeding facilities. The second barrier\nto implementation is the possibility that the civil liberties of the less\nfortunate are being infringed, e.g., by limiting the choice of foods available\nto those who are dependent on governments for subsistence, such as patients in\nhospitals, the very poor, and prisoners. Ways of protecting the rights of\nthese people while encouraging them to adopt healthful dietary practices must\nbe found. One way to avoid even the appearance of taking advantage of the less\nfortunate is to start implementation programs among independent groups rather\nthan the indigent and dependent. For example, employee dining rooms in\ngovernment facilities should be tackled before attempts to implement dietary\nrecommendations are made with the hospitalized or the poor.\n _ACTION 1: The Office of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs (DVA) should direct its health-care personnel to follow dietary\nrecommendations in all of its food and health care systems._\nDuring fiscal year 1988, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the\nVeterans Administration) maintained a total of 172 medical centers\n(hospitals), 119 nursing homes, and 26 domiciles for veterans and treated more\nthan 1 million patients in these facilities (DVA, 1989). The DVA should\nincorporate dietary recommendations into all aspects of their food\noperations\u2014menu planning, food purchasing, preparation, and service. The\npresent clinical nutrition and dietetic personnel should be retained in the\nDVA system to provide the technical assistance needed to implement dietary\nrecommendations.\nFederal agencies, such as NIH through its National Cancer Institute or\nNational Institute on Aging, should collaborate with the DVA medical system to\ndevelop grant mechanisms to establish demonstration projects for implementing\ndietary recommendations and other activities directed toward achieving the\nnational health promotion and disease prevention objectives of DHHS by the\nyear 2000 (DHHS, 1990a). Likewise, DVA and private hospitals should work\ncooperatively as often as possible to develop and coordinate research and\ntraining initiatives to accomplish this particular action. More\nrecommendations about the training of healthcare professionals are discussed\nin Chapter 7.\nSeveral specific steps can be taken to further strengthen the use of diet and\nhealth principles in the DVA system. The first priority should be\nimplementation of dietary recommendations in the food environment for the well\npatients and visitors in the DVA system; sufficient choice of foods should be\navailable so that those who want to eat in a manner consonant with dietary\nrecommendations are able to do so. Changes in the diets of sick patients need\nto be made on a case-by-case basis, since other therapeutic considerations may\ntake precedence. In addition, the following actions should be considered:\n _ACTION 2: The surgeons general of the Army, Navy, and Air Force within the\nDepartment of Defense (DOD) should develop a plan for implementing dietary\nrecommendations in all aspects of the DOD food and health-care systems._\nThe DOD feeds thousands of people each day. It offers meals in dining halls,\nin other eating facilities, and in the hospitals and clinics it operates\naround the world. Because of these huge feeding operations, DOD purchases\nimmense quantities of food and thus has a large influence on the country's\nfood supply. The DOD assistant secretaries for health and the surgeon general\nof each service are charged with maintaining the health and fitness of\nenlisted personnel and their families. Thus, DOD has many opportunities to\nprovide good examples of implementing dietary recommendations. The committee\ncommends the DOD for making substantial advances in addressing nutritional\nconcerns of military personnel over the past two decades. Since 1985, there\nhas been an evaluation of the systems of feeding military populations to\ndetermine the nutritional adequacy of the diets consumed (DHHS, 1989). Results\nof this assessment serve as the basis for modifying menus, standardizing\nrecipes, designing cook training programs, and developing specifications for\nthe purchase of food and combat rations. In a recent assessment of basic Army\ntrainees at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, mean dietary fat intakes by both the\nmen and women for 7 days were less than 35% of total calories. The \"absence of\na short-order line and limitation on high-fat, high-calorie bakery items\n(donuts, pastries, etc.) may have assisted in the attainment of this goal\"\n(U.S. Army, 1989). This assessment represents a single evaluation in a highly\ncontrolled environment. More attention needs to be paid to continuing\nevaluation, surveillance, and implementation of all aspects of dietary\nrecommendations rather than on fat consumption alone.\nNutrition-related regulations for the nation's active and reserve military\nservices have been in existence for decades. These regulations have three\nmajor purposes: (1) to establish dietary allowances for military feeding, (2)\nto prescribe nutrient standards for packaged rations, and (3) to provide basic\nguidelines for nutrition education. They were last revised in 1985 and will be\nreviewed again now that the 3rd edition of the federal government's _Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans_ report (USDA/DHHS, 1990) has been released. Because\nthese regulations are used by cooks in the military as well as by the vendors\nwho supply packaged rations, the committee recommends that the manual of\nregulations provide more emphasis on practical ways to meet dietary\nrecommendations. Special efforts must be made to motivate cooks and vendors to\nalter their products and make them more compatible with the principles of\ndietary recommendations.\n _ACTION 3: The DOD's food and beverage services and practices should be\nrevised to conform to dietary recommendations._\nMess halls, officers' clubs, clubs for enlisted personnel, and other private\nfood services on military facilities should be encouraged to serve at least\none identified meal choice, among the several offered, that conforms to the\nprinciples of dietary recommendations. The committee believes that the DOD\nshould also develop a plan to implement dietary recommendations in its food\nand health services, including canteens and officers' clubs. The emphasis\nshould not be placed upon changing combat rations or other special feeding\nsituations. The enormous complexity of the implementation process within the\nDOD is recognized. Yet at the very least, efforts in DOD facilities should\nmatch those of other federal facilities.\n _ACTION 4: Urge the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to examine the\nfeasibility of providing diets in line with dietary recommendations,\nrecognizing the complexity of the correctional system and the special role of\nfood in correctional facilities._\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons is responsible for ensuring the adequacy and\nhealthfulness of diets served in the large network of federal correctional\nfacilities under its jurisdiction. The social milieu of correctional\ninstitutions is complex, and changes in prison life are difficult to\nadminister. Food has a great deal of symbolism in correctional institutions,\nand the mess hall is a place where violence occurs. Occasionally, correctional\nofficials have instituted diets limiting sugary and sweet foods in the hope\nthat they will prevent or treat violent and disruptive behavior, but this has\nbeen to no avail (Gray, 1986). The American Correctional Association, which\nreviews correctional facilities, suggests that menus meet the RDAs. These\nmenus should also help prisoners to meet dietary recommendations. Groups\nincluding registered dietitians, nutrition educators, health educators,\ncorrectional officials, and inmates should convene to discuss and take action\non designing acceptable prison diets that meet dietary recommendations.\n _ACTION 5: The General Services Administration (GSA) should ensure that food\ncontracts and monitoring systems are made to conform to the principles of\ndietary recommendations._\nThose who work in or visit government offices often dine in federal\nfacilities. Others attend catered functions sponsored by government agencies.\nMany government cafeterias are operated by the GSA, which in turn contracts\nwith providers of food, catering, and vending services. Technical assistance\nto food producers and preparers should be provided or built into GSA contracts\nso that these people will be able to provide appealing products and menus that\nhelp employees and other consumers meet dietary recommendations. Voluntary,\nshort term technical assistance will not be sufficient. Rather, long-term\ninnovations in service, education, and surveillance are likely to be required.\nQuality assurance programs for foods purchased by governments should be\nadapted whenever possible to include standards consistent with the principles\nof dietary recommendations.\n _ACTION 6: Department secretaries should encourage government employees to\nconsume diets that meet dietary recommendations._\nDepartment secretaries have initiated programs to promote fitness and\ndiscourage smoking in their departments. It is entirely fitting that similar\nprograms encouraging employees to eat in accord with dietary recommendations\nbe initiated together with educational programs to assist them in learning how\nto accomplish this goal.\n _ACTION 7: The U.S. government personnel ultimately responsible for funding\nofficial meal functions should offer meals that are consistent with the\nprinciples of dietary recommendations._\nThis recommendation is applicable to all branches of governments (executive,\nlegislative, and judicial) at all levels (federal, state, and local).\n **STRATEGY 5: Develop a comprehensive research, monitoring, and evaluation\nplan to achieve a better understanding of the factors that motivate people to\nmodify their eating habits and to monitor the progress toward implementation\nof dietary recommendations.**\n _ACTION 1: The secretaries of USDA and DHHS should mandate increased amounts\nof intramural research that relate to implementation of dietary\nrecommendations and give high priority to the funding of extramural research\nin this area._\nGovernments as well as the private sector, foundations, and voluntary\norganizations can perform or fund research that will expedite the\nimplementation of dietary recommendations and surveys that will monitor the\nprogress of implementation and evaluate its impact. Such research would\ninclude intervention studies to further understanding of the potential for\nchronic disease reduction (DHHS, 1988a; NRC, 1989a), social and behavioral\nstudies to elucidate factors that motivate people to modify their food habits\nover the long term, and techniques to enhance the availability of foods that\nhelp people to meet dietary recommendations. A discussion of directions for\nfuture research is provided in Chapter 9.\n _ACTION 2: Improve the National Nutrition Monitoring System and provide it\nwith adequate resources._\nThe National Nutrition Monitoring System consists of a diverse set of surveys\nand surveillance activities conducted by 12 agencies within six federal\ndepartments\u2014DHHS, USDA, DVA, DOD, Commerce, and Labor (DHHS/USDA, 1986, 1989).\nIt provides data on the per-capita availability of foods and nutrients;\nhousehold and individual food intakes; prevalence of under-and overnutrition\nusing anthropometric, biochemical, and hematological indicators of nutritional\nstatus; prevalence of chronic diseases and risk factors for those diseases;\nand mortality. However, different program obligations and logistical\nrequirements have led to differences in the methods used to collect and\npresent the information (DHHS/USDA, 1989). Budget constraints have led to\ndelays in the start of some surveys and to cuts in the sample sizes. Some\ngroups are frequently excluded from surveys of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population, including active-duty military, Native\nAmericans, and people without fixed addresses (including the homeless and\nmigrant families who might have limited access to food [Nestle, 1990]). Other\ngroups, such as racial minorities, are not included in sufficient numbers to\npermit valid estimates of their nutritional status or health (DHHS/USDA, 1986,\n1989). Little information is collected about the population's knowledge of and\nattitudes toward food and its relationship to health. Better information on\nthe status of the population with respect to recommended dietary patterns will\nhelp to plan and target interventions, thus maximizing the budget that will be\nallocated.\nYour browsing activity is empty.\nActivity recording is turned off.\nTurn recording back on\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information,  U.S. National Library of\nMedicine 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD, 20894 USA\n\n"}, {"source": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310741/", "content": "**Warning:** The NCBI web site requires JavaScript to function. more...\nNCBI Bookshelf. A service of the National Library of Medicine, National\nInstitutes of Health.\nImplementing the WHO Stop TB Strategy: A Handbook for National Tuberculosis\nControl Programmes. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2008.\nMeasures to control TB should be carried out in compliance with international\nand national legislation and regulations pertaining to communicable diseases,\nand specific provisions concerning TB. NTPs should be aware of the provisions\napplicable to TB. The following sections outline the main categories of legal\nand regulatory measures that are relevant to TB control.\nThe purpose of the IHR (2005), which entered into force in June 2007, is \u201cto\nprevent, protect against, control and provide public health response to the\ninternational spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and\nrestricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference\nwith international traffic and trade\u201d. The mandate is much broader than that\nof the previous IHR (1969) in which the provisions applied primarily to\nplague, cholera and yellow fever. The IHR (2005) provide generally for any\nevent with the potential to cause a public health emergency of international\nconcern, which may be of biological, chemical or radionuclear origin, and\nwhether or not the etiology is known at the time. Provisions include (i)\nroutine public health measures at ports, airports and ground crossings and\n(ii) identification of and response to public health emergencies.\nNotification of TB to WHO is not required under the IHR (2005) unless a\npotential international emergency is involved. Situations in which TB may\npotentially fall within the scope of the IHR might arise in connection with\ninternational travel by infectious TB patients, particularly those with MDR-TB\nor XDR-TB. The IHR (2005) include a Decision Instrument, with criteria to\nidentify events that are to be notified (Article 6; Annex 2).\nWhen WHO is informed of an event that might potentially represent an\ninternational public health emergency, a consultative process of risk\nassessment take place with the national health authority on the risks posed\nand any further measures to be taken (Articles 6\u201313). Subject to various\nprotections, States Parties may require: (i) international travellers to\nprovide information on the itinerary and review of travel documents; (ii) non-\ninvasive medical examinations (that could include sputum examination) to\ndetermine whether or not a public health risk is involved; and (iii)\nadditional procedures, depending on evidence and circumstances (Article 23).\nProvisions are included in the IHR (2005) to protect international travellers\nagainst unjustified health measures and to respect their human rights; these\ncover informed consent for medical examination and health measures,\nconfidentiality of personal data, and protection against charges for health\nmeasures applied for public health protection.\nStates Parties have, as a requirement, a national IHR focal point at central\nlevel (usually in the ministry of health). In the case of a TB event involving\nthe IHR, the WHO country and regional advisers for TB and the NTP manager will\nbe the points of contact for the national IHR focal point during investigation\nand follow-up.\nLegislation on communicable disease control is an essential expression of\nnational political commitment. Regulations based on that legislation are\nadopted to apply its principles and provisions, including those concerning TB.\nThe NTP manager is required to be informed about and comply with the pertinent\nnational legislation and regulations. National communicable disease\nlegislation is being revised in many countries to align it with obligations\nunder the IHR (2005).\nIn countries where adequate health legislation does not exist, the NTP should\nadvocate for its adoption. Legislation, through general provisions, should\nempower the ministry of health to produce health regulations, including\nregulations for TB control. Such regulations may be modified and updated\naccording to changes in epidemiology or technical resources (whereas national\nlegislation is less readily revised).\nThe purpose of legislation is to support the prevention and control of TB\nwhile protecting public health and the legal rights of individuals. A WHO\n\u201cgood practice\u201d model for communicable disease legislation and TB regulation\nis available. It is recommended that national TB control regulations should\ninclude measures for:\nLegislation should respect human dignity and rights as well as public health.\nHowever, legislation should make provision for certain extraordinary\nsituations where involuntary compliance with key measures is required to\nprotect public health, subject to appropriate safeguards (e.g. mandatory\nmedical examinations, isolation, quarantine) or where other measures such as\ncontact tracing may be necessary.\nWhere voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, compulsion should always be\nregarded as the action of last resort and applied with safeguards to ensure\nthat it is fully justified strictly provided by the law, non-discriminatory,\nwith possibility of appeal, of limited duration, subject to review and that\nthe least restrictive option is applied. Compulsory measures should be\ncommensurate with the resulting benefit and applied in the expectation that\neffective action will result.\nMeasures applied to international travellers will also need to accord with the\ncountry's obligations under the IHR (2005).\nA legislative framework is in place in most countries to implement and enforce\na national drug policy and to regulate the activities of both the public and\nprivate sectors. However, the framework for drug regulation varies from\ncountry to country, and in some it is very limited in scope and application.\nNTP managers should be aware of the existing national legal provisions\nconcerning anti-TB medicines and how they are applied.\nThe national drug regulatory authority develops and implements most of the\nlegislation and regulations on pharmaceutical products. Its responsibilities\ninclude registration of drugs; controls on imports and marketing; licensing;\ninspection and enforcement; monitoring of adverse drug reactions; and quality\ncontrol.\nAn important task of the drug regulatory authority is to institute a system\nthat subjects all pharmaceutical products to premarketing evaluation and\nmarketing authorization, also known as _drug registration,_ to ensure that\nproducts conform to required standards of quality, safety and efficacy. Drug\nevaluation and registration include the review and approval of the product\ndata sheets and labels. This information is usually disseminated through drug\ninserts or drug formularies.\nThe marketing surveillance activities of the drug regulatory authority\nintegrate administrative procedures to ensure that pharmaceutical products are\nimported only if they have received an import licence before reaching the\ncountry. The entity responsible for importation of pharmaceutical products\nshould comply with all specifications on the relevant import licence. All\nimported products should have been registered by the national drug regulatory\nauthority or should have received a marketing authorization. Exceptionally, a\nwaiver may be granted based on public health considerations.\nA mandatory system of licensing manufacturers, importing and exporting agents,\ndistributors and retail pharmacies is usually in place to ensure that all\nproducts conform to acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy. In\naddition, all premises and practices used to manufacture, store, distribute\nand dispense these products should comply with requirements to ensure\ncontinued conformity to standards until products are delivered to the end-\nuser. Overall quality assurance of drug manufacture is essential to ensure\ngood quality. These practices are defined in good manufacturing practice (GMP)\nguidelines. The entity involved in the importation, exportation and\ndistribution chain should ensure the proper storage of products, and their\nappropriate handling, packaging and distribution. These practices are defined\nin good distribution practice (GDP) guidelines.\nInspection is an important strategy for safeguarding drug quality. It is\nintended to ensure that all activities in drug manufacture, import, export,\ndistribution, etc. comply with regulatory and quality assurance requirements,\nas well as with regulations. The drug regulatory authority usually establishes\nits own enforcement strategies to promote compliance with drug regulations.\nThe strategy should be based on a pyramid of sanctions to be applied in a\nproportionate manner in cases of non-compliance.\nNational pharmacovigilance systems collect and evaluate information on adverse\ndrug reactions. Some countries have established their own adverse reaction\nreporting mechanism, and the regulatory capacity to use the information\ngathered. Examples of possible actions include suspension of a drug's market\napproval, the recall of certain batches, a warning in a national drug bulletin\nor a separate warning sent out to a list of institutions and main prescribes.\nDrug quality control laboratories are responsible for checking, by appropriate\ntesting, whether drugs are of the required quality. Each drug regulatory\nauthority should have access to a quality control laboratory, which will also\nplay an important role in the registration process and in the surveillance of\nthe quality of marketed products. For relatively small countries, quality\ncontrol may be coordinated at a regional centre.\nThe WHO _Declaration on occupational health for all_ (1994) calls upon\ngovernments to prepare a special national policy and programme for\noccupational health, including provision of competent occupational health\nservices for all people at work. Such a programme should include the\ndevelopment of appropriate legal provisions, and systems for enforcement, with\ninspection by competent occupational health authorities. The Declaration\nspecifies the characteristics of a well-organized and competent occupational\nhealth service.\nThe NTP should be aware of the existing national legislation and regulations\nconcerning occupational health. In health-care settings, medical and other\nstaff may be at significant risk of exposure to _M. tuberculosis_ infection\n(see Chapter 6). In the event of infection occurring among staff, legal action\nmay be envisaged by the infected staff if adequate measures to prevent\ntransmission of _M. tuberculosis_ have not been implemented. Staff should be\nfully informed of the national occupational regulations and any possibilities\nthat exist for compensation in the event of infection acquired in the\nworkplace.\nRecommendations on the transport of infectious substances are included in the\nModel Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, developed by the United\nNations Economic and Social Council's Committee of Experts on the Transport of\nDangerous Goods and updated every two years. These recommendations form the\nbasis of national and international transport regulations. Packing\nrequirements, labelling and documentation are subject to regulation for the\nnational (where applicable) and international transport of infectious\nsubstances.\nFor the international transport of TB samples, cultures of _M. tuberculosis_\nshould be shipped according to United Nations packaging instruction P620 and\naccompanied by the appropriate dangerous goods documentation (shipping\ndeclaration UN2814).\nOther TB-containing specimens should be shipped according to United Nations\npackaging instruction P650. No accompanying dangerous goods documentation is\nrequired in these cases (shipping declaration UN3373).\nLaboratories that send TB samples should be aware of all applicable\nregulations and have the necessary materials available. It is advisable to\nidentify locally available services and have supplies and local arrangements\nin place in advance.\nAll rights reserved.

Cohen, declaring Friday\nthey would try to bar the hedge fund mogul from managing other people\u2019s money.\nLegal experts said the charges represented a strategic calculation by the SEC\nthat some action had to be taken, but that the agency could end up struggling\nto prove its case.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cohen, 57, with failing to\nsupervise former SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager Mathew Martoma and SAC\nexecutive Michael Steinberg, both of whom face criminal and civil insider\ntrading charges.\nThe civil administrative proceeding is the most serious challenge yet to Cohen\nand his standing in the industry he helped build and which made him billions.\nSeveral lawyers said that unlike federal prosecutors who have additional time\nto file criminal charges against Cohen, the SEC is bumping up against a five-\nyear statute of limitations to bring civil charges stemming from its\ninvestigation.\n\u201cIt would appear the commission, rather than doing nothing, feels it has to do\nsomething. This constitutes something,\u201d said C. Evan Stewart, a partner at\nZuckerman Spaeder in New York who is not involved in the case.\nA spokesman for SAC Capital said the SEC\u2019s administrative proceeding had no\nmerit.\n\u201cSteve Cohen acted appropriately at all times and will fight this charge\nvigorously,\u201d said SAC\u2019s Jonathan Gasthalter.\nThe timing of the five-member commission\u2019s vote adds credence to the idea that\nthe SEC was scrambling.\nThe SEC did not vote on Cohen in a previously scheduled closed-door session it\nheld on Thursday. Instead, the commissioners discussed charging Cohen at 9\na.m. Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the commission\u2019s\nactivities.\nA vote outside of the normal meeting time can come up if the SEC is racing to\nbeat the statute of limitations on filing a charge, the source said.\nCommissioner Troy Paredes was on a plane when the rest of the group met. He\ncast his vote when he landed in Texas.\nThe SEC charges stem from a six-year probe of Cohen and his $15 billion hedge\nfund by regulators and federal investigators in which nine one-time SAC\nemployees have been charged or implicated.\nCohen, reputed to be one of the best traders of his generation, has emerged as\nthe primary focus of the federal government\u2019s crackdown on insider trading in\nthe $2.4 trillion hedge fund industry.\n\u201cCohen ignored the red flags and allowed Martoma and Steinberg to execute the\ntrades\u201d in several stocks where the SEC found evidence of insider trading, the\nagency said.\nThe charges are not part of a civil lawsuit filed in court; rather, they are\ncontained in an administrative proceeding. In a statement announcing the\nproceeding, the SEC said it would determine a penalty during the proceeding.\nIt is seeking to bar Cohen from the financial industry and from managing other\npeople\u2019s money.\nIn March, SAC agreed to pay a record $616 million penalty to settle a lawsuit\narising from an investigation of trading on illegal information.\nSome observers had thought the settlement would end much of SAC and Cohen\u2019s\ntroubles, but it did not. Soon afterward, federal prosecutors served grand\njury subpoenas on Cohen and others at the firm seeking their testimony. Cohen\nasserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and did not\ntestify.\nIn June, outside investors moved to pull at least $3 billion from the fund\nbecause of the ongoing investigation.\nIt is too early to tell whether the latest charges will put pressure on some\nof SAC\u2019s 900 employees to look for other jobs. That has not happened so far.\n\u201cThey are obviously trying to shut him down,\u201d said one investor with SAC\nCapital who declined to be identified. The investor said it would appear there\nwill be no criminal charge against Cohen, but regulators have decided to use\nwhat they can to force him out of business.\n\u201cI think this is certainly, at this stage, a victory for Cohen to avoid far\nmore serious charges,\u201d said Mark Kornfeld, a partner at Baker & Hostetler who\nis not connected to the case.\nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New York declined to comment.\nThe 17-page administrative order charges that in the matters involving\nSteinberg and Martoma, Cohen \u201creceived highly suspicious information that\nshould have caused any reasonable hedge fund manager in Cohen\u2019s position\u201d to\ndetermine whether the employees had acted appropriately.\nThe order also charges that Cohen \u201ctagged,\u201d or made specific notation of, some\nof the positions undertaken by the two men in his own portfolio, which\nentitled them to additional compensation.\nCohen personally oversees about $4 billion, along with a small group of\ntraders, in a portfolio called \u201cthe Cohen account,\u201d which represents a good\nchunk of the estimated $6 billion he has invested with his 21-year-old hedge\nfund, Reuters has previously reported.\nAn administrative proceeding can be a less favorable environment than a\nfederal court for a civil defendant in an SEC case.\nThere is no right to a jury trial, for example, and a defendant has fewer\nprotections against the admission of unfavorable evidence. The ability to take\ndepositions is also more limited.\nLawyers said that in a civil proceeding, Cohen could assert his Fifth\nAmendment right against self incrimination as he did in the criminal\ninvestigation. But the judge in the proceeding would be entitled to draw a\n\u201cnegative inference\u201d from Cohen\u2019s refusal to answer specific questions.\n\u201cI think they don\u2019t have the evidence for insider trading so they brought\nthis,\u201d Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney who is not connected to\nthe case, said of the SEC charges against Cohen. \u201cBringing a case like this\nunder circumstances here is going to be a difficult proof problem for them.\n\u201cThey are going to have to show that Mr. Cohen was not only in charge but that\nbasically he didn\u2019t act in good faith,\u201d Gorman added. \u201cIf he acted in good\nfaith and did not induce these acts directly or indirectly, then he\u2019s not\nliable.\u201d\nSeveral lawyers said since the SEC is not able to bring a conspiracy charge,\nit has fewer options than federal prosecutors to continue the investigation of\nCohen.\nJust this week, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a CNBC\nconference: \u201cPeople should be afraid that bad actions they have committed in\nthe past\u201d will catch up with them.\nReporting by Emily Flitter; Additional reporting by Katya Wachtel, Jonathan\nStempel, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Sarah N.

of another,\nthen any law under which special personal attributes, relationships or\ncircumstances (special personal characteristics) give rise to criminal\nliability also applies to the representative if these characteristics do not\nexist in the person of that representative but in the entity, partnership or\nperson represented.\n(2) If a person, whether by the owner of a business or somebody delegated by\nthe owner to do so,\n1\\. has been commissioned to manage the business in whole or in part or\n2\\. has been expressly commissioned to perform autonomous duties which are\nincumbent upon the owner of the business\nand that person acts on the basis of this commission, then any law under which\nspecial personal characteristics give rise to criminal liability also applies\nto the person commissioned if these characteristics do not exist in the person\ncommissioned but in the person of the owner of the business. An enterprise is\nequal to a business within the meaning of sentence 1. If a person acts on the\nbasis of a similar commission for an agency performing public administrative\nservices, sentence 1 applies analogously.\n(3) Subsections (1) and (2) apply even if the act of commission intended to\ncreate the power of representation or the agency is void.\ntable of contents\nSection 15  \nIntentional and negligent conduct\nUnless the law expressly provides for criminal liability for negligent\nconduct, only intentional conduct attracts criminal liability.\ntable of contents\nSection 16  \nMistake of fact\n(1) Whoever, at the time of the commission of the offence, is unaware of a\nfact which is a statutory element of the offence is deemed to lack intention.\nAny criminal liability for negligence remains unaffected.\n(2) Whoever, at the time of commission of the offence, mistakenly assumes the\nexistence of facts which would satisfy the elements of a more lenient\nprovision may only be punished for the intentional commission of the offence\nunder the more lenient provision.\ntable of contents\nSection 17  \nMistake of law\nIf, at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender lacks the\nawareness of acting unlawfully, then the offender is deemed to have acted\nwithout guilt if the mistake was unavoidable.

If the offence is not\ncompleted without any action on the part of the person abandoning the attempt,\nno penalty is incurred if that person has made voluntary and earnest efforts\nto prevent the completion of the offence.\n(2) If more than one person participates in the offence, then whoever\nvoluntarily prevents its completion incurs no penalty for attempt. That\nperson\u2019s voluntary and earnest efforts to prevent the completion of the\noffence suffice for exemption from punishment if the offence is not completed\nwithout any action on that person\u2019s part or it is committed independently of\nthat person\u2019s earlier contribution to the offence.\ntable of contents\nTitle 3  \nCommission and participation\ntable of contents\nSection 25  \nCommission of offence\n(1) Whoever commits an offence themselves or through another incurs a penalty\nas an offender.\n(2) If several persons commit an offence jointly, each person incurs a penalty\nas an offender (joint offenders).\ntable of contents\nSection 26  \nAbetting\nWhoever intentionally induces another to intentionally commit an unlawful act\n(abettor) incurs the same penalty as an offender.\ntable of contents\nSection 27  \nAiding\n(1) Whoever intentionally assists another in the intentional commission of an\nunlawful act incurs a penalty as an aider.\n(2) The penalty for the aider is determined in accordance with the penalty\nthreatened for the offender.

The penalty must, however, be mitigated pursuant to\nsection 49 (1). Section 23 (3) applies accordingly.\n(2) Whoever declares their willingness or accepts the offer of another or\nagrees with another to commit or incite to the commission of a serious\ncriminal offence incurs the same penalty.\ntable of contents\nSection 31  \nWithdrawal from attempted participation\n(1) Whoever voluntarily\n1\\. abandons the attempt to induce another to commit a serious criminal\noffence and averts any existing danger that the other may commit the offence,\n2\\. abandons their plans after previously having declared their willingness to\ncommit a serious criminal offence or\n3\\. prevents the commission of an offence after previously having agreed to\ncommit a serious criminal offence or having accepted the offer of another to\ncommit a serious criminal offence\ndoes not incur the penalty under section 30.\n(2) If the offence is not completed without any action on the offender\u2019s part\nor if it is committed independently of his or her previous conduct, the\noffender\u2019s voluntary and earnest efforts to prevent the completion of the\noffence suffices for exemption from punishment.\ntable of contents\nTitle 4  \nSelf-defence and necessity\ntable of contents\nSection 32  \nSelf-defence\n(1) Whoever commits an act in self-defence does not act unlawfully.\n(2) \u2018Self-defence\u2019 means any defensive action which is necessary to avert a\npresent unlawful attack on oneself or another.\ntable of contents\nSection 33  \nExcessive self-defence\nWhoever exceeds the limits of self-defence due to confusion, fear or fright\nincurs no penalty.\ntable of contents\nSection 34  \nNecessity as justification\nWhoever, when faced with a present danger to life, limb, liberty, honour,\nproperty or another legal interest which cannot otherwise be averted, commits\nan act to avert the danger from themselves or another is not deemed to act\nunlawfully if, upon weighing the conflicting interests, in particular the\naffected legal interests and the degree of the danger facing them, the\nprotected interest substantially outweighs the one interfered with. However,\nthis only applies to the extent that the act committed is an adequate means to\navert the danger.\ntable of contents\nSection 35  \nNecessity as defence\n(1) Whoever, when faced with a present danger to life, limb or liberty which\ncannot otherwise be averted, commits an unlawful act to avert the danger from\nthemselves, a relative or close person acts without guilt. This does not apply\nto the extent that the offender could be expected, under the circumstances, to\naccept the danger, in particular because said offender caused the danger or\nbecause of the existence of a special legal relationship; the penalty may,\nhowever, be mitigated pursuant to section 49 (1), unless the offender was\nrequired to accept the danger on account of the existence of a special legal\nrelationship.\n(2) If, at the time of the commission of the act, a person mistakenly assumes\nthat circumstances exist which would provide an excuse under the terms of\nsubsection (1), that person incurs a penalty only if the mistake was\navoidable.

The minimum fine is five and, unless\notherwise provided by law, the maximum is 360 full daily rates.\n(2) The court determines the amount of the daily rate having regard to the\noffender\u2019s personal and financial circumstances. In doing so, it typically\nbases its assessment on the average net income which the offender earns or\ncould earn in one day. A daily rate is set at no less than 1 euro and no more\nthan 30,000 euros.\n(3) The offender\u2019s income and assets and other relevant assessment factors may\nbe estimated when setting the amount of the daily rate.\n(4) The number and amount of the daily rates are indicated in the decision.\ntable of contents\nSection 41  \nFine in addition to imprisonment\nIf the offence has led to the actual or attempted enrichment of the offender,\nthen, in addition to a term of imprisonment, a fine which would not otherwise\nhave been provided for, or only in the alternative, may be imposed if, having\nregard to the offender\u2019s personal and financial circumstances, this appears\nappropriate.\ntable of contents\nSection 42  \nRelaxation of payment conditions\nIf a convicted person cannot, due to personal or financial circumstances, be\nexpected to pay the full fine immediately, the court is to allow a certain\ntime for payment or is to allow payment in specified instalments. The court\nmay order that the privilege of paying the fine in specified instalments is to\nbe revoked if the convicted person fails to pay an instalment in time. The\ncourt is also, as a rule, to relax payment conditions if otherwise the\noffender\u2019s restitution of any damage caused by the offence would be\nsubstantially impaired; the court may require the convicted person to present\nproof of restitution having been made.\ntable of contents\nSection 43  \nDefault imprisonment\nIf a fine cannot be recovered, it is to be substituted by imprisonment. One\ndaily rate corresponds to one day of imprisonment. The minimum term of default\nimprisonment for failure to pay a fine is one day.\ntable of contents\nAdditional penalty\ntable of contents\nSection 44  \nDriving ban\n(1) If a person has been sentenced to imprisonment or to a fine for an\noffence, the court may ban the offender from driving all classes of motor\nvehicle or a specific class of motor vehicle on public roads for a period of\nbetween one month and six months. Imposition of a driving ban may in\nparticular be considered in cases where the offence was not committed whilst\nor in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle or in breach of the\nduties of a driver of a motor vehicle if this appears necessary either to have\nan influence on the offender or to defend the legal order or if it means\nimposition of a sentence of imprisonment or its enforcement can thereby be\navoided. A driving ban is typically to be imposed in the cases of conviction\npursuant to section 315c (1) no. 1 (a), (3) or section 316 if disqualification\nfrom driving pursuant to section 69 is not ordered.\n(2) The driving ban takes effect when the driving licence is confiscated upon\nthe judgment having become final, but no later than one month after the\njudgment has become final. National and international driving licences issued\nby a German authority are to be confiscated for the duration of the ban. This\nalso applies if the driving licence was issued by an authority of a Member\nState of the European Union or another Contracting Party to the Agreement on\nthe European Economic Area if the holder is ordinarily resident in Germany.\nThe driving ban is endorsed on any other foreign driving licences.\n(3) If a driving licence is to be confiscated or the driving ban to be\nendorsed on a foreign driving licence, the duration of the ban is calculated\nfrom the day on which those conditions are met. Any period during which the\noffender was detained in an institution by official order does not count\ntowards the duration.\n(4) If the court has imposed several driving bans against an offender which\nhave become final, the durations of these bans are to be calculated\nconsecutively. The duration of the ban which has become final first runs\nfirst.

If a measure of reform and prevention\ninvolving deprivation of liberty was ordered in addition to imprisonment, the\nduration begins on the day on which that measure was disposed of.\n(3) If enforcement of the sentence, the remainder of the sentence or the\nmeasure was suspended on probation or by an act of clemency, any probation\nperiod is included when calculating the duration if, after its expiry, the\nsentence or the remainder thereof was remitted or the measure was disposed of.\ntable of contents\nSection 45b  \nReinstatement of abilities and rights\n(1) The court may reinstate any abilities and rights lost pursuant to section\n45 (1) and (2) and any rights lost pursuant to section 45 (5) if\n1\\. the loss has been in effect for half of its intended duration and\n2\\. it is to be expected that the convicted person will commit no further\nintentional offences.\n(2) Any period during which the convicted person was detained in an\ninstitution by official order is not taken into account.\ntable of contents\nTitle 2  \nFixing of penalties\ntable of contents\nSection 46  \nGeneral principles\n(1) The offender\u2019s guilt provides the basis on which the penalty is fixed. The\neffects which the penalty can be expected to have on the offender\u2019s future\nlife in society are to be taken into account.\n(2) When fixing the penalty the court weighs the circumstances which speak in\nfavour of and those which speak against the offender. The following, in\nparticular, may be taken into consideration:\nthe offender\u2019s motives and objectives, in particular including racist,\nxenophobic or other motives evidencing contempt for humanity,\nthe attitude reflected in the offence and the degree of force of will involved\nin its commission,\nthe degree of the breach of the offender\u2019s duties,\nthe modus operandi and the consequences caused by the offence to the extent\nthat the offender is to blame for them,\nthe offender\u2019s prior history, personal and financial circumstances, and\nthe offender\u2019s conduct in the period following the offence, in particular\nefforts to make restitution for the harm caused as well as efforts at\nreconciliation with the victim.\n\n\n(3) No consideration may be given to circumstances which are already statutory\nelements of the offence.\ntable of contents\nSection 46a  \nVictim\u2013offender mediation, restitution\nIf the offender,\n1\\. in an effort to achieve reconciliation with the victim (victim\u2013offender\nmediation), has made restitution for the act committed in full or to a\nsubstantial degree or has earnestly striven to make restitution or\n2\\. in a case in which making restitution for the harm caused required\nsubstantial personal effort or personal sacrifice on the offender\u2019s part, has\nmade compensation to the victim in full or to a substantial degree,\nthen the court may mitigate the penalty pursuant to section 49 (1) or, if the\nsentence to be imposed on the offender is no more than imprisonment for a term\nnot exceeding one year or a fine not exceeding 360 daily rates, it may\ndispense with imposing a penalty.\ntable of contents\nSection 46b  \nContributing to discovery or prevention of serious crimes\n(1) If the perpetrator of a criminal offence which is punishable by an\nincreased minimum sentence of imprisonment or imprisonment for life\n1\\. has, by voluntarily disclosing what he or she knows, contributed\nsubstantially to the detection of one of the offences under section 100a (2)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure ( _Strafproze\u00dfordnung_ ) which is related to\nhis or her own offence or\n2\\. voluntarily discloses what he or she knows to an authority in time to\nprevent the completion of one of the offences under section 100a (2) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure which is related to his or her own offence, the\nplanning of which the perpetrator is aware of,\nthen the court may mitigate the penalty pursuant to section 49 (1), whereby\nthe threatened penalty of imprisonment for life is substituted by imprisonment\nfor a term of at least 10 years. In order to determine whether an offence is\npunishable by an increased minimum sentence of imprisonment, only aggravations\nfor especially serious cases are taken into account but no mitigations. If the\noffender participated in the act, the contribution made to its detection in\naccordance with sentence 1 no. 1 must exceed the offender\u2019s own contribution\nto the act. Instead of reducing the sentence, the court may dispense with\nimposing a penalty if the threatened penalty for the offence is only a\ndeterminate sentence of imprisonment and the offender would not be sentenced\nto a term exceeding three years.\n(2) In arriving at its decision under subsection (1), the court must have\nparticular regard to:\n1\\. the nature and scope of the disclosed facts and their relevance to the\ndiscovery or prevention of the offence, the time of disclosure, the degree of\nsupport which the offender gave to the prosecuting authorities and the\nseverity of the offence to which the offender\u2019s disclosure relates as well as\n2\\. the relationship between the circumstances referred to in no. 1 and the\nseverity of the offence committed and the degree of the offender\u2019s guilt.\n(3) Mitigation of penalty or dispensing with imposing a penalty in accordance\nwith subsection (1) is ruled out if the offender does not disclose what he or\nshe knows until after main proceedings have been opened against him or her\n(section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\ntable of contents\nSection 47  \nShort terms of imprisonment only as exception\n(1) The court only imposes a term of imprisonment of less than six months\nwhere special circumstances exist, either in the offence or the offender\u2019s\ncharacter, which strictly require the imposition of imprisonment either to\nhave an influence on the offender or to defend the legal order.\n(2) If the law does not provide for a fine and a term of imprisonment of six\nmonths or more is ruled out, the court imposes a fine, unless the imposition\nof a sentence of imprisonment is strictly required under subsection (1). If\nthe law provides for an increased minimum sentence of imprisonment, the\nminimum fine in the cases under sentence 1 is determined by the minimum\nsentence of imprisonment; 30 daily rates correspond to one month\u2019s\nimprisonment.\ntable of contents\nSection 48  \n(repealed)\ntable of contents\nSection 49  \nSpecial mitigating circumstances established by law\n(1) If the law requires or allows for mitigation under this provision, the\nfollowing applies:\n1\\. Imprisonment for life is substituted by imprisonment for a term of at\nleast three years.\n2\\. In cases of imprisonment for a fixed term, no more than three quarters of\nthe statutory maximum sentence may be imposed. In case of a fine, the same\napplies to the maximum number of daily rates.\n3\\. Any increased minimum statutory term of imprisonment is reduced as\nfollows:\nin the case of a minimum term of ten or five years, to two years,\nin the case of a minimum term of three or two years, to six months,\nin the case of a minimum term of one year, to three months,\nin all other cases to the statutory minimum.\n(2) If the court may, at its discretion, mitigate the penalty pursuant to a\nlaw which refers to this provision, it may reduce the penalty to the statutory\nminimum or impose a fine instead of imprisonment.\ntable of contents\nSection 50  \nMultiple mitigating circumstances\nA circumstance which, alone or together with other circumstances, justifies\nthe assumption that the case is a less serious one and which simultaneously\nrepresents a special statutory mitigating circumstance as referred to in\nsection 49 may only be considered once.\ntable of contents\nSection 51  \nCrediting of time spent in remand detention\n(1) If a convicted person was remanded in detention or otherwise subjected to\ndeprivation of liberty because of an offence which is or was the subject of\nthe proceedings, that time is credited against a determinate sentence of\nimprisonment or a fine. The court may, however, order that such time not be\ncredited in whole or in part if, in the light of the convicted person\u2019s\nconduct after the offence, this is not justified.\n(2) If, in subsequent proceedings, another sentence is substituted for a\npreviously imposed sentence after that sentence becomes final, time served\nunder or credited against the earlier sentence is credited against the new\nsentence.\n(3) If a convicted person has already been sentenced abroad for the same\noffence, the foreign sentence, to the extent it has been enforced, is credited\nagainst the new sentence. Subsection (1) applies accordingly to any other\ndeprivation of liberty suffered abroad.\n(4) When crediting a fine against time spent in remand detention or vice\nversa, one day in which a person is deprived of their liberty corresponds to\none daily rate. Where a foreign penalty or deprivation of liberty is to be\ncredited, the court determines the rate at its discretion.\n(5) When crediting a period of provisional disqualification from driving\n(section 111a of the Code of Criminal Procedure) against a driving ban in\naccordance with section 44, subsection (1) applies accordingly. To that end,\nthe taking into custody, securing or seizure of the driving licence (section\n94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) is equivalent to provisional\ndisqualification from driving.\ntable of contents\nTitle 3  \nFixing of penalties for multiple offences\ntable of contents\nSection 52  \nSeveral offences committed by one act\n(1) If the same act violates more than one criminal statute or the same\ncriminal statute more than once, only one penalty is imposed.\n(2) If more than one criminal statute has been violated, the penalty is\ndetermined according to the statute which provides for the most severe\npenalty. The penalty may not be more lenient than the other applicable\nstatutes permit.\n(3) Under the conditions of section 41, the court may separately impose a fine\nin addition to a sentence of imprisonment.\n(4) Additional penalties, incidental legal consequences and measures (section\n11 (1) no. 8) must or may be imposed if one of the applicable statutes so\nrequires or allows.\ntable of contents\nSection 53  \nJoinder of offences\n(1) If a person has committed several offences, all of which are to be\nadjudicated at the same time, and that person has incurred more than one\nsentence of imprisonment or more than one fine, an aggregate sentence is\nimposed.\n(2) If a sentence of imprisonment concurs with a fine, an aggregate sentence\nis imposed. The court may, however, impose a separate fine; where a fine is to\nbe imposed in such cases for more than one offence, an aggregate fine is\nimposed.\n(3) Section 52 (3) and (4) applies analogously.\ntable of contents\nSection 54  \nFixing of aggregate sentence\n(1) If one of the penalties for the individual offences is imprisonment for\nlife, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed. In all other\ncases, the aggregate sentence is fixed by increasing the most severe\nindividual sentence incurred and, in the case of different kinds of penalties,\nby increasing the sentence which is most severe in nature. The person of the\noffender and the individual offences are considered in their totality.\n(2) The aggregate sentence may not exceed the sum of the individual sentences.\nIn the case of determinate sentences of imprisonment, it may not exceed 15\nyears and in the case of a fine 720 daily rates.\n(3) Where an aggregate sentence is to be formed of a sentence of imprisonment\nand a fine, one daily rate corresponds to one day\u2019s imprisonment for the\npurpose of calculating the sum of the individual sentences.\ntable of contents\nSection 55  \nSubsequent fixing of aggregate sentence\n(1) Sections 53 and 54 also apply to a convicted person who has had a sentence\nimposed by final judgment if that person is convicted of another offence\ncommitted prior to the earlier conviction before the original sentence is\nenforced, barred by the statute of limitations or remitted. The earlier\nconviction is the judgment in those proceedings in which the underlying\nfindings of fact were last examined.\n(2) Additional penalties, incidental legal consequences and measures (section\n11 (1) no. 8) imposed in the earlier decision are to be upheld to the extent\nthey have not been rendered moot by the new decision.\ntable of contents\nTitle 4  \nSuspension of sentence on probation\ntable of contents\nSection 56  \nSuspension of sentence\n(1) If a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one\nyear, the court suspends enforcement of the sentence on probation if there are\nreasons to believe that the sentence itself will serve as sufficient warning\nto the convicted person and that the convicted person will commit no further\noffences even without having to serve the sentence. The court is, in\nparticular, to take account of the convicted person\u2019s character and previous\nhistory, the circumstances of the offence committed, the convicted person\u2019s\ncircumstances and conduct in the period following the offence, and the effects\nto be expected from the suspension.\n(2) Under the conditions of subsection (1), the court may also suspend\nenforcement of a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding two years on probation\nif, after an overall evaluation of the offence and of the convicted person\u2019s\ncharacter, special circumstances are deemed to exist. In making its decision,\nthe court is, in particular, to take account of any efforts on the convicted\nperson\u2019s part to make restitution for the harm caused by the offence.\n(3) Enforcement of imprisonment for a term of at least six months is not\nsuspended if the defence of the legal order so requires.\n(4) The suspension may not be limited to a part of the sentence. It is not\nruled out by any crediting of time spent in remand detention or another form\nof deprivation of liberty.\ntable of contents\nSection 56a  \nProbation period\n(1) The court determines the length of the period of probation.

In consultation with the court, the probation officer monitors\ncompliance with conditions and directions as well as with offers and\nassurances made and, at intervals determined by the court, reports on the\nconvicted person\u2019s conduct. The probation officer must inform the court about\nserious or persistent breaches of the conditions, directions, offers or\nassurances.\n(4) The probation officer is appointed by the court.

If the suspension\non probation is revoked, the court may, however, credit services towards the\nsentence which the convicted person has rendered to comply with conditions\nissued under section 56b (2) sentence 1 nos. 2 to 4 or related offers in\naccordance with section 56b (3).\ntable of contents\nSection 56g  \nRemission of sentence\n(1) If the court does not revoke the suspension of the sentence, the sentence\nis to be remitted after expiry of the probation period.

If\nthe convicted person has served at least one year of the sentence imposed\nbefore the remainder is suspended on probation, the court typically places the\nconvicted person under the supervision and guidance of a probation officer for\nall or a part of the probation period.\n(4) Where a sentence of imprisonment has been reduced by crediting time\nserved, it is deemed to have been served within the meaning of subsections (1)\nto (3).\n(5) Sections 56f and 56g apply accordingly.

If the\nunlawful act which has been committed is not an offence as referred to in\nsentence 1, the court only makes such an order if special circumstances\njustify the expectation that, due to the offender\u2019s condition, the offender\nwill in future commit such serious offences.\ntable of contents\nSection 64  \nPlacement in addiction treatment facility\nIf a person has an addiction to alcoholic drinks or other intoxicating\nsubstances and is convicted of an unlawful act which was committed in a state\nof intoxication or as a result of an addiction, or the person is not convicted\nonly on account of the finding of a lack criminal responsibility or the lack\nof criminal responsibility cannot be ruled out on the evidence, the court is,\nas a rule, to order placement in an addiction treatment facility if there is a\ndanger that said person will in future commit serious unlawful acts as a\nconsequence of this proclivity. Such order is only to be made if there is a\nsufficiently reasonable prospect that the person can be cured within the\nperiod referred to in section 67d (1) sentence 1 or 3 by way of placement in\nan addiction treatment facility or that a relapse into addictive behaviour and\nthe commission of serious unlawful acts caused by that proclivity can be\nprevented for a substantial period of time.\ntable of contents\nSection 65  \n(repealed)\ntable of contents\nSection 66  \nPlacement in preventive detention\n(1) The court orders preventive detention in addition to a sentence of\nimprisonment where\n1\\. a person has been sentenced for an intentional offence to imprisonment for\na term of at least two years and\na) the offence was directed against life, physical integrity, personal liberty\nor sexual self-determination,\nb) the offence falls under Chapter 1, 7, 20 or 28 of the Special Part or under\nthe Code of Crimes against International Law ( _V\u00f6lkerstrafgesetzbuch_ ) or\nthe Narcotics Act ( _Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz_ ) and the maximum possible\nsentence is imprisonment for a term of at least 10 years or\nc) the conditions of section 145a are met insofar as an order was made for the\nsupervision of conduct on the basis of an offence under letter (a) or (b), or\nif the conditions of section 323a are met insofar as the offence committed in\na state of intoxication was one of those referred to in letter (a) or (b),\n2\\. the offender has twice been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at\nleast one year in each case for offences under no. 1 which were committed\nprior to the present offence,\n3\\. the offender has served at least a two-year sentence of imprisonment or\nwas under a measure of reform and prevention involving deprivation of liberty\nfor at least one of these offences prior to the present offence and\n4\\. an overall evaluation of the offender and the offences committed leads to\nthe conclusion that, on account of the propensity to commit serious crimes, in\nparticular of a type which results in severe emotional trauma or physical\ninjury to the victim, the offender poses a danger to the general public at the\ntime of the conviction.\nSection 12 (3) applies accordingly in respect of the classification of an\noffence under sentence 1 no. 1 (b) and section 68 (1) sentence 4 for the\ntermination of the supervision of conduct referred to in sentence 1 no. 1 (c).\n(2) If a person has committed three offences of the type referred to in\nsubsection (1) sentence 1 no. 1, for each of which a penalty of imprisonment\nfor a term of at least one year was incurred and a sentence of imprisonment\nfor a term of at least three years for one or more of these offences was\nimposed, the court may, under the conditions of subsection (1) sentence 1 no.\n4, order preventive detention in addition to the sentence of imprisonment even\nif there was no prior deprivation of liberty (subsection (1) sentence 1 nos. 2\nand 3).\n(3) If a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at least two years\nfor a serious criminal offence which fulfils the conditions of subsection (1)\nsentence 1 no. 1 (a) or (b), or for an offence under section 89a (1) to (3),\nsection 89c (1) to (3), section 129a (5) sentence 1 alternative 1, also in\nconjunction with section 129b (1), sections 174 to 174c, section 176, section\n177 (2) no. 1, (3) and (6), sections 180, 182 and 224 and section 225 (1) or\n(2), or for an intentional offence under section 323a, insofar as the offence\ncommitted in a state of intoxication is one of the aforementioned unlawful\nacts, then the court may order preventive detention in addition to the\nsentence if the offender was already sentenced to imprisonment for a term of\nat least three years for one or more such offences committed prior to the new\noffence and if the conditions of subsection (1) sentence 1 nos. 3 and 4 are\nmet. If a person has committed two of the offences referred to in sentence 1\nfor each of which they have incurred a penalty of imprisonment for a term of\nat least two years, and if they are sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at\nleast three years for one or more such offences, then the court may, under the\nconditions of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 4, order preventive detention in\naddition to the sentence even in the absence of a prior conviction or\ndeprivation of liberty (subsection (1) sentence 1 nos. 2 and 3). Subsections\n(1) and (2) remain unaffected.\n(4) Within the meaning of subsection (1) sentence 1 no. 2, an aggregate\nsentence is deemed to be a single sentence. If time spent in remand detention\nor other deprivation of liberty is credited against a sentence of\nimprisonment, it is deemed to be time served for the purposes of subsection\n(1) sentence 1 no. 3. A previous offence is not considered if more than five\nyears have elapsed between its commission and the subsequent offence; in the\ncase of offences against sexual self-determination, this period is 15 years.\nAny period during which the offender was detained in an institution by\nofficial order is not included is not taken into account. An offence\nadjudicated outside the territorial scope of this statute is deemed to be\nequivalent to an offence adjudicated within the territorial scope of this\nstatute if it would represent an offence of the type referred to in subsection\n(1) sentence 1 no. 1, under German criminal law or, in the cases under\nsubsection (3), it would be a criminal offence of the type referred to in\nsubsection (3) sentence 1.\ntable of contents\nSection 66a  \nPreventive detention reserved\n(1) The court may reserve preventive detention if\n1\\. a person is convicted of one of the offences under section 66 (3) sentence\n1,\n2\\. the remaining conditions of section 66 (3) are met, unless that provision\nmakes reference to section 66 (1) sentence 1 no. 4 and\n3\\. it is not possible to determine with sufficient certainty but it is\nprobable that the conditions of section 66 (1) sentence 1 no. 4 are met.\n(2) The court may also reserve preventive detention if\n1\\. a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of at least five years\nfor one or more serious criminal offences directed against life, physical\nintegrity, personal liberty, sexual self-determination, under Chapter 28 or\nunder sections 250 and 251, also in conjunction with section 252 or 255,\n2\\. the conditions of section 66b are not met and\n3\\. it is possible to determine with sufficient certainty or it is at least\nprobable that the conditions of section 66 (1) sentence 1 no. 4 are met.\n(3) The court of first instance may take a decision in regard to preventive\ndetention reserved in accordance with subsections (1) or (2) no later than the\ndate on which the prisoner will have served the sentence imposed in full; this\nalso applies where enforcement of the remainder of the sentence was suspended\non probation and the remainder of the sentence is being enforced. The court\nmakes the order if an overall evaluation of the convicted person, the offence\nor offences committed and also the convicted person\u2019s development up until the\ndate of the decision indicate that there is less likelihood of any further\nserious offences being committed by that person resulting in severe emotional\ntrauma or physical injury to the victims.\ntable of contents\nSection 66b  \nSubsequent order of preventive detention\nIf placement in a psychiatric hospital has been declared disposed of in\naccordance with section 67d (6) on account of the condition leading to a lack\nof criminal responsibility or diminished responsibility on which the order was\nbased not existing at the time of that declaration, the court may subsequently\norder preventive detention where\n1\\. placement in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with section 63 was\nordered based on more than one of the offences set forth in section 66 (3)\nsentence 1 or if the person had either previously been sentenced to\nimprisonment for a term of at least three years or was placed in a psychiatric\nhospital on account of having committed one or more such offences prior to the\noffence leading to placement in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with\nsection 63 and\n2\\. an overall evaluation of the person concerned, the offences committed and\nthat person\u2019s development up until the date of the decision indicate that it\nis highly likely that said person will commit serious crimes resulting in\nsevere emotional trauma or physical injury to the victims.\nThis also applies where, following a period of placement pursuant to section\n63, a sentence of imprisonment imposed at the same time is to be enforced in\nfull or in part.\ntable of contents\nSection 66c  \nOrganisation of preventive detention and preceding imprisonment\n(1) Preventive detention is carried out in institutions which\n1\\. offer a level of support to the detainee, based on a comprehensive\ntreatment examination and of a regularly updated detention plan,\na) which is individualised and intensive and suitable for incentivising and\nfostering the detainee\u2019s cooperation, in particular psychiatric,\npsychotherapeutic or socio-therapeutic treatment which is tailored to the\ndetainee\u2019s needs, insofar as standardised offers do not appear promising and\nb) whose aim is to minimise the detainee\u2019s dangerousness to the public to a\ndegree that the measure may be suspended on probation or declared disposed of\nas soon as possible,\n2\\. guarantee that the placement\na) burdens the detainee as little as possible, matches the requirements of\nsupport under no. 1 and, security interests notwithstanding, is adapted to\ngeneral conditions of life and\nb) is carried out in special buildings or wings which are separate from the\nprison regime, unless the treatment under no. 1 exceptionally requires\notherwise and\n3\\. in order to achieve the goal referred to in no. 1 (b),\na) offer measures for an open detention regime and preparations for the\ndetainee\u2019s release, unless compelling objections exist, in particular specific\nfactors indicating a danger that the detainee might abscond or use the\nmeasures to commit serious offences and\nb) provide follow-up support, in close cooperation with state or private\nproviders, once the detainee is at liberty.\n(2) If the court has, in its judgment, ordered preventive detention (section\n66), either reserved (section 66a (3)) or subsequently (section 66b), or has\nreserved such an order for preventive detention (section 66a (1) and (2)), the\noffender must, during the term of imprisonment imposed, be offered support\nwithin the meaning of subsection (1) no. 1, in particular socio-therapeutic\ntreatment, with the aim of making enforcement of the placement (section 67c\n(1) sentence 1 no. 1) or its order (section 66a (3)) unnecessary wherever\npossible.\ntable of contents\nSection 67  \nSequence of enforcement\n(1) If placement in an institution in accordance with section 63 and section\n64 is ordered in addition to a sentence of imprisonment, the measure is\nenforced before the sentence of imprisonment.\n(2) However, the court is to order that all or part of the sentence be\nenforced before the measure if the purpose of the measure will thereby be more\nreadily achieved. When making the order for placement in an addiction\ntreatment facility in addition to imprisonment for a term of at least three\nyears, the court is, as a rule, to order that a part of the sentence be\nenforced before the measure. That part of the sentence is to be calculated in\na manner which enables a decision under subsection (5) sentence 1 to be made\nafter the part of the sentence and the measure have been enforced. The court\nis, as a rule, to further determine that the sentence is to be enforced before\nthe measure if the convicted person is required to leave the country and may\nbe deported from the Federal Republic of Germany and if there is reason to\nbelieve that the convicted person\u2019s residence within the territorial scope of\nthis statute will be terminated whilst serving the sentence or immediately\nafter the sentence has been served.\n(3) The court may subsequently make, modify or set aside an order under\nsubsection (2) sentence 1 or 2 if that is deemed appropriate based on the\nconvicted person\u2019s circumstances. The court may also subsequently make the\norder under subsection (2) sentence 4. If it has made an order in accordance\nwith subsection (2) sentence 4, it then revokes such order if there is reason\nto believe that the convicted person\u2019s residence within the territorial scope\nof this statute will no longer be terminated whilst serving the sentence or\nimmediately after the sentence has been served.\n(4) If the measure is enforced in full or in part before the sentence, the\nperiod of enforcement is credited against the sentence up to a maximum of two\nthirds of the penalty.\n(5) If the measure is enforced before the sentence or a remainder of the\nsentence, the court may suspend enforcement of the remainder of the sentence\nunder the conditions of section 57 (1) sentences 1 and 2 if half of the\nsentence has been served. If the remainder of the sentence is not suspended,\nenforcement of the measure continues; the court may, however, order that the\nsentence be served if this is deemed appropriate based on the convicted\nperson\u2019s circumstances.\n(6) The court orders that any crediting in accordance with subsection (4) is\nalso to be made in regard to a sentence arising from a separate criminal\nconviction if its enforcement would mean undue hardship for the convicted\nperson. In particular, consideration is to be given, when taking this\ndecision, to the relationship between the length of the previous deprivation\nof liberty and the length of the newly imposed sentence, the therapeutic\nsuccess achieved thus far and the concrete danger the person poses, as well as\nthat person\u2019s conduct during enforcement. A measure is, as a rule, not\ncredited against a sentence of the separate criminal conviction where the\nunderlying offence has been committed after the measure was ordered.\nSubsection (5) sentence 2 applies accordingly.\ntable of contents\nSection 67a  \nTransfer to another measure\n(1) If placement in a psychiatric hospital or in an addiction treatment\nfacility has been ordered, the court may subsequently transfer the detained\nperson to the other of those two measures if this would improve the chances of\nthat person\u2019s successful social rehabilitation.\n(2) Under the conditions of subsection (1), the court may also subsequently\ntransfer a person subject to preventive detention to one of the measures\nreferred to in subsection (1). Subsequent transfer may be ordered where the\nconditions of subsection (1) are met and the transfer is indicated for the\npurposes of carrying out medical or addiction treatment, including for those\npersons who are still serving a sentence of imprisonment and whose preventive\ndetention has been ordered or reserved.\n(3) The court may modify or set aside a decision taken in accordance with\nsubsections (1) and (2) if it subsequently transpires that this would improve\nthe chances of the detained person\u2019s successful social rehabilitation.\nFurther, the court may set aside a decision made in accordance with subsection\n(2) if it subsequently transpires that enforcing the measures referred to in\nsubsection (1) will not lead to the desired result.\n(4) The length of the terms of placement and the periods of review are\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions which apply to an order made in a\njudgment. In the case under subsection (2) sentence 2, up until enforcement of\nthe measure commences the court is required to carry out a review at regular\nintervals of no more than one year as to whether the conditions for a decision\nunder subsection (3) sentence 2 are met.\ntable of contents\nSection 67b  \nSimultaneous suspension of measure\n(1) If the court orders placement in a psychiatric hospital or in an addiction\ntreatment facility, it simultaneously suspends the measure on probation if\nspecial circumstances justify the expectation that the purpose of the measure\ncan also be achieved in this manner. Suspension is not to be ordered if the\nperson still has to serve a sentence of imprisonment which was imposed at the\nsame time as the measure and which has not been suspended on probation.\n(2) The order for suspension automatically leads to the supervision of\nconduct.\ntable of contents\nSection 67c  \nDeferred start of placement\n(1) If a sentence of imprisonment is served prior to a period of placement\nwhich has been ordered for the same offence or offences and the review\nrequired before the end of the term of imprisonment shows that\n1\\. the purpose of the placement no longer requires its enforcement or\n2\\. placement in preventive detention would be disproportionate because the\noffender was not, in an overall evaluation of the course of the sentence of\nimprisonment served, offered sufficient support within the meaning of section\n66c (2) in conjunction with section 66c (1) no. 1,\nthen the court suspends the measure on probation; the order for suspension\nautomatically leads to the supervision of conduct. The review under sentence 1\nno. 1 is not required if the preventive detention was ordered by the court of\nfirst instance less than one year before the end of the term of imprisonment.\n(2) If enforcement of placement has not yet commenced within three years after\nits order becomes final and if a case under subsection (1) or section 67b does\nnot exist, then the measure may only be enforced if the court so orders. Any\nperiod during which the offender was detained in an institution by official\norder is not taken into account. The court orders enforcement if the purpose\nof the placement still so requires. If the purpose of the placement has not\nbeen achieved yet special circumstances justify the expectation that it may be\nachieved by suspending enforcement, the court suspends the measure on\nprobation; the order for suspension automatically leads to the supervision of\nconduct. If the purpose of the measure has been achieved, the court declares\nit disposed of.\ntable of contents\nSection 67d  \nPeriod of placement\n(1) The period of placement in an addiction treatment facility may not exceed\ntwo years. This term runs from the start of the measure. Where a measure\ninvolving deprivation of liberty is enforced before a sentence of imprisonment\nimposed at the same time, the maximum period is extended by the length of the\nterm of imprisonment to the extent that the time spent in the measure is\ncredited against the sentence.\n(2) If no maximum period is provided for or the period has not yet expired,\nthe court suspends the remainder of the measure on probation if it is to be\nexpected that the person subject to the measure will no longer commit any\nserious unlawful acts if released. The same applies if, after enforcement of\npreventive detention has begun, the court finds that its further enforcement\nwould be disproportionate because the preventive detainee was not offered\nsufficient support within the meaning of section 66c (1) no. 1 before a period\nset by the court not exceeding six months has elapsed; if sufficient support\nwas not offered, the court is to set such a period when reviewing the\nsuspension of enforcement, indicating the measures to be offered. Suspension\nunder sentence 1 or 2 automatically leads to the supervision of conduct.\n(3) Where 10 years of preventive detention have been served, the court\ndeclares the measure disposed of if there is no danger that the preventive\ndetainee will commit further serious crimes resulting in severe emotional\ntrauma or physical injury to the victims. The order for release automatically\nleads to the supervision of conduct.\n(4) Once the maximum period has expired, the detainee is released. The measure\nis thus disposed of. Release from detention automatically leads to the\nsupervision of conduct.\n(5) The court declares the placement in an addiction treatment facility\ndisposed of where the conditions of section 64 sentence 2 are no longer met.\nRelease from an addiction treatment facility automatically leads to the\nsupervision of conduct.\n(6) If, after enforcement of placement in a psychiatric hospital has begun,\nthe court finds that the conditions for the measure no longer exist or that\ncontinued enforcement of the measure would be disproportionate, the court\ndeclares it disposed of. Once the measure has lasted six years, its\ncontinuation is generally no longer proportionate, unless there is a danger\nthat the detainee will, as a result of his or her condition, commit serious\nunlawful acts causing severe emotional trauma or physical injury to the\nvictims or exposing the victims to the danger of severe physical injury or\nemotional trauma. After 10 years of detention, subsection (3) sentence 1\napplies accordingly. Release from the measure automatically leads to the\nsupervision of conduct. The court waives supervision of conduct if it is to be\nexpected that the person will no longer commit any further offences even\nwithout the measure.\ntable of contents\nSection 67e  \nReview\n(1) The court may at any time review whether further enforcement of the\nmeasure involving deprivation of liberty is to be suspended on probation or\nthe measure is to be declared disposed of. It is required to perform the\nreview within specified periods.\n(2) The specified periods are\nsix months in the case of placement in an addiction treatment facility,\none year in the case of placement in a psychiatric hospital,\none year in the case of preventive detention, nine months after 10 years of\npreventive detention.\n(3) The court may reduce these periods. It may also set dates within the\nstatutory limits for review before the expiry of which an application for\nreview is inadmissible.\n(4) The periods run from the commencement of the detention. If the court\ndenies suspension or disposal, the period commences anew with that decision.\ntable of contents\nSection 67f  \nMultiple orders\nIf the court orders placement in an addiction treatment facility, any previous\nsuch order is deemed to be disposed of.\ntable of contents\nSection 67g  \nRevocation of suspended measures\n(1) The court revokes the suspension of a measure involving deprivation of\nliberty if the convicted person\n1\\. commits an unlawful act during the period of supervision of conduct,\n2\\. grossly or persistently breaches directions as referred to in section 68b\nor\n3\\. persistently evades the supervision and guidance of the probation officer\nor of the supervisory authority,\nand as a result the purpose of the measure requires the convicted person\u2019s\ndetention. Sentence 1 no. 1 applies accordingly if the reason for revocation\narose in the period between the decision on suspension and the start of\nsupervision of conduct (section 68c (4)).\n(2) The court even revokes the suspension of a measure involving deprivation\nof liberty in accordance with sections 63 and 64 if evidence arises during the\nperiod of the supervision of conduct that the convicted person is expected to\ncommit unlawful acts as a result of his or her condition and the purpose of\nthe measure therefore requires the convicted person\u2019s detention.\n(3) The court further revokes the suspension if circumstances which have come\nto its attention during the period of the supervision of conduct and which\nwould have led to the suspension being denied show that the purpose of the\nmeasure requires the convicted person\u2019s detention.\n(4) The period of placement before and after the revocation may not, in its\ntotality, exceed the maximum statutory period for the measure.\n(5) If the court does not revoke suspension of the placement, it is deemed\ndisposed of upon conclusion of the period of supervision of conduct.\n(6) Payments which the convicted person has made in the fulfilment of\ndirections are not to be reimbursed.\ntable of contents\nSection 67h  \nLimited order for measure to take effect; crisis intervention\n(1) During the period of supervision of conduct the court may order that the\nsuspended placement under section 63 or 64 take effect for a duration not\nexceeding three months if there has been an acute deterioration in the\nreleased person\u2019s condition or a relapse into addictive behaviour and the\nmeasure is necessary in order to avoid a revocation under section 67g. Under\nthe conditions of sentence 1, it may order the renewal of the measure or\nextend its duration; the maximum duration of the measure may not exceed a\ntotal of six months. Section 67g (4) applies accordingly.\n(2) The court sets aside the measure before the expiry of the period set under\nsubsection (1) if its purpose has been achieved.\ntable of contents\nSupervision of conduct\ntable of contents\nSection 68  \nPreconditions\n(1) If a person has incurred a determinate sentence of imprisonment of at\nleast six months for an offence for which the law specifically provides for\nthe supervision of conduct, the court may order supervision of conduct in\naddition to the penalty if there is a danger that the person will commit\nfurther offences.\n(2) The statutory provisions providing for supervision of conduct (section\n67b, section 67c, section 67d (2) to (6) and section 68f) remain unaffected.\ntable of contents\nSection 68a  \nSupervisory authority, probation service, forensic outpatient service\n(1) The convicted person is assigned to a supervisory authority; the court\nappoints a probation officer to support the convicted person for the period of\nthe supervision of conduct.\n(2) The probation officer and the supervisory authority act together to offer\nthe convicted person assistance and support.\n(3) The supervisory authority, in consultation with the court and with the\nsupport of the probation officer, supervises the convicted person\u2019s conduct\nand compliance with directions issued.\n(4) Where there is any disagreement between the supervisory authority and the\nprobation officer as to questions which affect the assistance and support\ngiven to the convicted person, it is for the court to resolve the matter.\n(5) The court may issue instructions to the supervisory authority and the\nprobation officer in regard to their functions.\n(6) Before filing a request to prosecute under section 145a sentence 2, the\nsupervisory authority is to hear the probation officer; subsection (4) does\nnot apply.\n(7) Where a direction as referred to in section 68b (2) sentences 2 and 3 has\nbeen issued, the forensic outpatient service is to work together with the\nparties referred to in subsection (2). In all other cases, subsections (3) and\n(6) concerning the probation officer\u2019s status also apply to the forensic\noutpatient service.\n(8) The parties referred to in subsection (1) and the staff of the forensic\noutpatient service referred to in section 203 (1) nos. 1, 2 and 6 are to\ndisclose third-party secrets to each other which have come to their attention\nin the course of their activities within the relationship indicated in section\n203 or otherwise to the extent that this is necessary to support the convicted\nperson in avoiding the commission of further offences.

The court\nmay, in particular, direct the convicted person to receive psychiatric,\npsychotherapeutic or socio-therapeutic care and treatment (therapy direction).\nThe care or treatment may be provided by a forensic outpatient service.\nSection 56c (3) applies accordingly, including to the direction in respect of\ninvasive alcohol or drug tests.\n(3) The directions may not make unreasonable demands in respect of the\nconvicted person\u2019s lifestyle.\n(4) If, upon a period of supervision of conduct beginning, an existing\nsupervision of conduct is deemed ended under the terms of section 68e (1)\nsentence 1 no. 3, the court order must include the directions issued in the\ncontext of the previous supervision of conduct.\n(5) To the extent that the support given to a convicted person in the cases\nunder subsection (1) no. 11 or treatment in accordance with subsection (2) is\nnot provided by a forensic outpatient service, section 68a (8) applies\naccordingly.\ntable of contents\nSection 68c  \nPeriod of supervision of conduct\n(1) The period of supervision of conduct is no less than two years and no more\nthan five years.

If, in the cases\nunder sentence 1 no. 1, the convicted person subsequently consents, the court\ndetermines the further period of the supervision of conduct. Otherwise,\nsection 68e (3) applies.\n(3) The court may extend the supervision of conduct for an indeterminate\nperiod exceeding the maximum in subsection (1) sentence 1 if\n1\\. there is reason to believe, in the case of a suspended order for placement\nin a psychiatric hospital under section 67d (2), that the convicted person is\notherwise about to lapse into a condition as indicated in section 20 or 21\nwhich will result in a danger to the general public on account of that person\ncommitting further serious unlawful acts or\n2\\. there is reason to believe, on account of non-compliance with directions\nunder section 68b (1) or (2) or other specific circumstances, that there is a\ndanger to the general public on account of that person committing further\nserious crimes and\na) the convicted person has been sentenced to a single or aggregate sentence\nof imprisonment of at least two years or has been placed in a psychiatric\nhospital or in an addiction treatment facility for offences under section 181b\nor\nb) supervision of conduct under the conditions of section 68b (1) sentence 3\nno. 1 was triggered and the single or aggregate sentence of imprisonment or\nthe placement was imposed or ordered for one or more serious criminal offences\nagainst life, physical integrity, personal liberty or under sections 250 and\n251, also in conjunction with section 252 or 255.\nSection 68b (1) sentence 4 applies accordingly to the termination of\nsupervision of conduct.\n(4) In the cases under section 68b (1), supervision of conduct commences once\nthe order becomes final, in the cases under section 67b (2), section 67c (1)\nsentence 1 and (2) sentence 4 and under section 67d (2) sentence 3, it\ncommences when the order for suspension becomes final or at a later date to be\nspecified by the court.

Section 67e (3) and (4) applies accordingly.\ntable of contents\nSection 68e  \nTermination or stay of supervision\n(1) Unless the order for supervision of conduct is indeterminate or in the\ncase of a suspension of a measure involving deprivation of liberty (sections\n67b (2), section 67c (1) sentence 1 and (2) sentence 4, section 67d (2)\nsentence 3), the supervision of conduct ends\n1\\. upon commencement of enforcement of a measure involving deprivation of\nliberty,\n2\\. upon commencement of enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment in addition\nto which a measure involving deprivation of liberty has been ordered,\n3\\. upon commencement of a new order for supervision of conduct.\nIn all other cases, the supervision of conduct is stayed for the period in\nwhich a person is serving a sentence of imprisonment or a measure involving\ndeprivation of liberty. The court sets aside any supervision of conduct which\nis triggered by the suspension of a measure involving deprivation of liberty\nif it is no longer necessary in the light of the existence of one of the\ncircumstances indicated in sentence 1 nos. 1 to 3. If a new order for\nsupervision of conduct is made in addition to an existing indeterminate order\nfor supervision of conduct or in the case of the suspension of a measure\ninvolving deprivation of liberty, the court is to order that the new measure\nbe dropped if it is not necessary in view of the existing one.\n(2) The court terminates the supervision of conduct if it is to be expected\nthat the convicted person will no longer commit further offences without the\nmeasure. The termination may not be ordered before the expiry of the statutory\nminimum period. The court may set periods not exceeding six months before the\nexpiry of which an application for the termination of supervision of conduct\nis inadmissible.\n(3) In the case of indeterminate supervision of conduct, the court is\nrequired,\n1\\. in the cases under section 68c (2) sentence 1, no later than after the\nexpiry of the maximum period under section 68c (1) sentence 1,\n2\\. in the cases under section 68c (3), before the expiry of two years,\nto review whether a decision under subsection (2) sentence 1 is necessary.

This does not apply\nwhere a measure of reform and prevention involving deprivation of liberty is\nto be enforced immediately after the sentence has been served.\n(2) The court may waive the supervision of conduct if it is to be expected\nthat the convicted person will no longer commit further offences without the\nmeasure.\ntable of contents\nSection 68g  \nSupervision of conduct and suspension on probation\n(1) If an order has been made for the suspension of a sentence or the\nsuspension of the remainder of a sentence, or disqualification from exercising\na profession has been suspended on probation and if the convicted person is at\nthe same time under supervision of conduct for the same or another offence,\nthen only sections 68a and 68b apply in relation to the supervision of conduct\nand the issuing of directions. Supervision of conduct does not end before the\nexpiry of any probation period.\n(2) If an order has been made for suspension on probation and for the\nsupervision of conduct on the basis of the same offence, the court may,\nhowever, determine that the supervision of conduct be stayed until the end of\nany probation period. In this case, the probation period is not credited\nagainst the period of supervision of conduct.\n(3) If, after the end of the probation period, the sentence or the remainder\nthereof is remitted or the disqualification from exercising a profession is\ndeclared disposed of, then the order made for the supervision of conduct on\nthe basis of the same offence also ends. This does not apply if the\nsupervision of conduct is indeterminate (section 68c (2) sentence 1 or (3)).\ntable of contents\nDisqualification from driving\ntable of contents\nSection 69  \nDisqualification from driving\n(1) Whoever has been convicted of an unlawful act which they committed in\nconnection with the driving of a motor vehicle or in breach of the duties of\nthe driver of a motor vehicle, or whoever has not been convicted merely\nbecause their lack of criminal responsibility has been proved or cannot be\nruled out, is disqualified from driving by the court if the act shows that\nthey are unfit to drive a motor vehicle. A further examination pursuant to\nsection 62 is not required.\n(2) If, in the cases under subsection (1), the unlawful act is a less serious\ncriminal offence of\n1\\. endangering road traffic (section 315c),\n1a. illegal motor racing (section 315d),\n2\\. driving under the influence of drink or drugs (section 316),\n3\\. leaving the scene of an accident without cause (section 142) although the\noffender knows or culpably does not know that a person was killed, seriously\ninjured or significant damage to the property of another was caused in the\naccident or\n4\\. intoxication (section 323a) if the offence relates to one of the offences\nreferred to in nos. 1 to 3,\nthen the offender is typically to be deemed unfit to drive motor vehicles.\n(3) The offender\u2019s driving licence lapses upon the judgment becoming final. A\ndriving licence issued by a German authority is confiscated in the judgment.\ntable of contents\nSection 69a  \nPeriod of disqualification\n(1) If the court disqualifies a driving licence, it simultaneously determines\nthat the driving licence is not to be reinstated for a period of between six\nmonths and five years (period of disqualification). The court may order that\nthe period of disqualification be permanent if it is to be expected that the\nstatutory maximum period will not suffice to avert the danger which the\noffender poses. If the offender has no driving licence, only a period of\ndisqualification is ordered.\n(2) The court may exclude particular types of motor vehicles from the period\nof disqualification if special circumstances justify the assumption that the\npurpose of the measure will not be jeopardised thereby.\n(3) The minimum period of disqualification is one year if a period of\ndisqualification was already ordered against the offender in the three years\nprior to the offence.\n(4) If the offender\u2019s driving licence was provisionally disqualified on\naccount of the offence (section 111a of the Code of Criminal Procedure), the\nlength of the provisional disqualification is deducted from the minimum period\nof the disqualification. In no case, however, may the period of\ndisqualification be less than three months.\n(5) The period of disqualification commences upon the judgment becoming final.\nThe time of a provisional disqualification ordered on account of the offence\nis credited against the period of the disqualification to the extent it has\nrun following the date of pronouncement of the judgment in those proceedings\nin which the findings of fact on which the measure was based were last\nexamined.\n(6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the confiscation, securing or\nseizure of a driving licence (section 94 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) is\nequivalent to provisional disqualification from driving.\n(7) If there is reason to believe that the offender is no longer unfit to\ndrive motor vehicles, the court may prematurely terminate the period of\ndisqualification. This termination may not be ordered unless the\ndisqualification has been in effect for three months, or one year in the cases\nunder subsection (3); subsection (5) sentence 2 and subsection (6) apply\naccordingly.\ntable of contents\nSection 69b  \nEffect of disqualification of foreign licence\n(1) If the offender is permitted to drive motor vehicles in Germany on the\nbasis of a licence granted abroad without a driving licence having been issued\nby a German authority, the disqualification order has the effect of a loss of\nthe right to make use of the licence in Germany. The right to drive motor\nvehicles in Germany lapses upon the decision becoming final. For the duration\nof the period of disqualification neither a German licence may be issued nor\nthe right to make use of the foreign licence be reinstated.\n(2) If the foreign driving licence was issued by an authority of a Member\nState of the European Union or another Contracting Party to the Agreement on\nthe European Economic Area and the holder is ordinarily resident in Germany,\nthe driving licence is confiscated in the judgment and sent back to the\nissuing authority. In all other cases, the loss of the right to drive and the\nperiod of disqualification is endorsed on the foreign driving licence.\ntable of contents\nDisqualification from exercising profession\ntable of contents\nSection 70  \nOrder for disqualification from exercising profession\n(1) Persons who have been convicted of an unlawful act which they committed in\nabuse of their profession or trade or in gross breach of the attendant duties,\nor who have not been convicted merely because their lack of criminal\nresponsibility was proved or cannot be ruled out, may be issued with an order\ndisqualifying them from exercising that profession, branch of profession,\ntrade or branch of trade for a period of between one year and five years if an\noverall evaluation of the offender and the offence shows that by further\nexercising the profession, branch of profession, trade or branch of trade\nthere is a danger that they will commit serious unlawful acts of the type\nindicated. The disqualification order may be made in perpetuity if there is\nreason to believe that the statutory maximum period will not suffice to avert\nthe danger posed by the offender.\n(2) Where the offender has been provisionally disqualified from exercising a\nprofession, branch of profession, trade or branch of trade (section 132a of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure), the length of the provisional\ndisqualification is deducted from the minimum period of the disqualification.\nIn no case, however, may the period of disqualification be less than three\nmonths.\n(3) For the duration of the disqualification, offenders may neither exercise\nthe profession, branch of profession, trade or branch of trade on behalf of\nanother nor have a person who is subject to their instructions engage in it on\ntheir behalf.\n(4) The disqualification commences upon the judgment becoming final. Any\nperiod of disqualification from exercising a profession imposed on account of\nthe act is credited against the disqualification period to the extent it has\nrun following the date of pronouncement of the judgment in those proceedings\nin which the findings of fact on which the measure was based were last\nexamined. Any period during which the offender was detained in an institution\nby official order is not taken into account.\ntable of contents\nSection 70a  \nSuspension of disqualification from exercising profession\n(1) If, after a disqualification order has been made, there is reason to\nbelieve that there is no longer a danger that the offender will commit serious\nunlawful acts of the type indicated in section 70 (1), the court may suspend\nthe order for a probation period.\n(2) The order may not be made before the expiry of one year. Any time of a\nprovisional disqualification is credited against the period of\ndisqualification referred to in section 70 (4) sentence 2. Any period during\nwhich the offender was detained in an institution by official order is not\ntaken into account.\n(3) If the disqualification order is suspended, section 56a and sections 56c\nto 56e apply accordingly. The probation period is extended by any time during\nwhich a sentence of imprisonment or a measure involving deprivation of liberty\nimposed on or ordered against the convicted person on account of the offence\nwas served.\ntable of contents\nSection 70b  \nRevocation of suspension and disposal of disqualification from exercising\nprofession\n(1) The court revokes the suspension of disqualification from exercising a\nprofession in the case of convicted persons who\n1\\. commit an unlawful act in the abuse of their profession or trade or in\ngross breach of the attendant duties during the probation period,\n2\\. grossly or persistently fail to comply with a direction or\n3\\. persistently evade the supervision and guidance of their probation\nofficer,\nand there is reason to believe that the purpose of the disqualification\nrequires its enforcement.\n(2) The court also revokes the suspension if evidence which has come to its\nattention during the probation period and which would have led to the\nsuspension being denied shows that the purpose of the measure requires the\ncontinued enforcement of the disqualification.\n(3) Any period of suspension of the disqualification from exercising a\nprofession is not credited against the period of disqualification.\n(4) Payments which a convicted person has made in the fulfilment of directions\nor assurances are not to be reimbursed.\n(5) After the probation period has expired, the court declares the\ndisqualification disposed of.\ntable of contents\nCommon provisions\ntable of contents\nSection 71  \nIndependent orders\n(1) The court may make an independent order for placement in a psychiatric\nhospital or in an addiction treatment facility if criminal proceedings are\nimpracticable because the offender lacks criminal responsibility or is unfit\nto stand trial.\n(2) The same applies to disqualification from driving and disqualification\nfrom exercising a profession.\ntable of contents\nSection 72  \nJoinder of measures\n(1) If the conditions for more than one measure are met but the intended\npurpose can be achieved through individual orders from amongst their number,\nonly the individual measures are to be ordered.

However, confiscation and rendering\nunusable is only ordered if\n1\\. the copies and the equipment indicated in subsection (1) sentence 2 are in\nthe possession of the offender, participant or another on whose behalf the\noffender or participant acted, or they are intended by these persons for\ndissemination and\n2\\. the measures are necessary to prevent unlawful dissemination by the\npersons referred to in no. 1.\n(4) Dissemination within the meaning of subsections (1) to (3) also means\nmaking material (section 11 (3)) or at least one copy of it available to the\npublic by putting it on display, putting it up to serve as an announcement,\nthrough presentation or by other means.\n(5) If, at the time of the decision on confiscation or rendering unusable\nbecoming final, a third party other than the offender or participant had\nownership of the property or the object was encumbered by a third party\u2019s\nright which was extinguished or prejudiced by the decision, the third party is\nto be adequately compensated in money from the Treasury, having regard to the\nfair market value.

In the\ncases under sections 74 to 74b and 74d, the court reserves the confiscation if\nits purpose can also be attained by means of a less incisive measure.\nConsideration is, in particular, to be given to instructions\n1\\. to render the objects unusable,\n2\\. to remove particular fittings or distinguishing marks from or to modify\nthe objects by other means or\n3\\. to dispose of the objects in a specific manner.\nIf the instructions are complied with, the reservation of the confiscation is\nrevoked; otherwise, the court subsequently orders the confiscation. If\nconfiscation is not otherwise prescribed, it may be limited to a part of the\nobjects.\n(2) In cases of rendering unusable under the terms of section 74d (1) sentence\n2 and (3), subsection (1) sentences 2 and 3 applies accordingly.\ntable of contents\nSection 75  \nEffects of confiscation\n(1) If confiscation of an object is ordered, ownership of the property or the\nright devolves to the state once the order becomes final if the object\n1\\. belongs to the person affected by the order at that time or if the person\naffected is entitled to the object at that time or\n2\\. belongs to some other person or if some other person is entitled to it,\nand that person has granted it for the offence or for other purposes whilst\nbeing aware of the circumstances of the offence.\nIn all other cases, ownership of the property or the right devolves to the\nstate once six months have elapsed after notice has been given of the order of\nconfiscation having become final, unless the person who owns or is entitled to\nthe object has previously filed this right with the enforcing authority.\n(2) In all other respects, the rights of third parties in the object remain.\nIn the cases under section 74b, however, the court orders the expiry of these\nrights. In the cases under sections 74 and 74a, the court may order the expiry\nof the right of a third party if that third party\n1\\. has contributed at least recklessly to the object being used as a means of\ncrime or to its being the object of crime or\n2\\. has acquired the right in the object in a reprehensible manner whilst\nbeing aware of the circumstances giving rise to the confiscation.\n(3) Up until such time as ownership of the property or the right is\ntransferred, the order of confiscation or the order to reserve confiscation\nhas the effect of a prohibition of disposal within the meaning of section 136\nof the Civil Code ( _B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch_ ).\n(4) In the cases under section 111d (1) sentence 2 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, section 91 of the Insolvency Code ( _Insolvenzordnung_ ) does not\napply.\ntable of contents\nSection 76  \nSubsequent order for confiscation of equivalent sum of money\nIf an order for the confiscation of an object is inadequate or unenforceable\non account of one of the conditions of section 73c or 74c having arisen or\nbecoming known after the order was made, the court may subsequently order\nconfiscation of the equivalent sum of money.\ntable of contents\nSection 76a  \nIndependent confiscation\n(1) If it is impossible to prosecute or convict a specific person for a\ncriminal offence, the court independently orders that the object be\nconfiscated or rendered unusable, provided that, in all other respects, the\nconditions under which the measure is prescribed by law are met. If\nconfiscation is permissible, the court may independently order it subject to\nthe conditions of sentence 1. Confiscation is not ordered if there is no\nrequest to prosecute, authorisation to prosecute or request to prosecute from\na foreign state, or if a decision with regard to said confiscation has already\nbeen taken and become final.\n(2) Under the conditions of sections 73, 73b and 73c, it is even permissible\nfor the court to independently order the confiscation of the proceeds of crime\nand to independently confiscate the value of the proceeds of crime in those\ncases in which the prosecution of the offence has become barred by the statute\nof limitations. Under the conditions of sections 74b and 74d, the same applies\nto instances in which the court independently orders confiscation of a\ndangerous object, confiscation of material or rendering unusable.\n(3) Subsection (1) is also to be applied if the court dispenses with imposing\na penalty or if the proceedings are terminated based on a legal provision\nwhich allows this to be done at the discretion of the public prosecution\noffice or of the court, or as they may decide by mutual consent.\n(4) An object derived from an unlawful act which has been seized in\nproceedings brought on suspicion of one of the offences referred to in\nsentence 3 having been committed is, as a rule, even to be separately\nconfiscated in those cases in which it is impossible to prosecute or convict\nthe person affected by the confiscation. If the confiscation of an object is\nordered, ownership of the property or the right to it devolves to the state\nonce the order becomes final; section 75 (3) applies accordingly.

Individuals rely on the statutory prohibitions against\nretaliation, also known as \"reprisal,\" when they complain to an employer about\nan alleged equal employment opportunity (EEO) violation, provide information\nas a witness in a company or agency investigation, or file a charge with the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (Commission or EEOC).\nThis Enforcement Guidance replaces the EEOC's _Compliance Manual Section 8:\nRetaliation_ , issued in 1998. Since that time, the Supreme Court and the\nlower courts have issued numerous significant rulings regarding employment-\nrelated retaliation.[1] Further, the percentage of EEOC private sector and\nstate and local government charges alleging retaliation has essentially\ndoubled since 1998.[2] Retaliation is now the most frequently alleged basis of\ndiscrimination in all sectors, including the federal government workforce.[3]\nThis document sets forth the Commission's interpretation of the law of\nretaliation and related issues. In crafting this guidance, the Commission\nanalyzed how courts have interpreted and applied the law to specific facts.\nRegarding many retaliation issues, the lower courts are uniform in their\ninterpretations of the relevant statutes. This guidance explains the law on\nsuch issues with concrete examples, where the Commission agrees with those\ninterpretations. Where the lower courts have not consistently applied the law\nor the EEOC's interpretation of the law differs in some respect, this guidance\nsets forth the EEOC's considered position and explains its analysis. The\npositions explained below represent the Commission's well-considered guidance\non its interpretation of the laws it enforces. This document also serves as a\nreference for staff of the Commission and staff of other federal agencies who\ninvestigate, adjudicate, litigate, or conduct outreach on EEO retaliation\nissues. It will also be useful for employers, employees, and practitioners\nseeking detailed information about the EEOC's position on retaliation issues,\nand for employers seeking promising practices.\n **Retaliation occurs when an employer takes a materially adverse action\nbecause an individual has engaged in, or may engage in, activity in\nfurtherance of the EEO laws the Commission enforces. The EEO anti-retaliation\nprovisions ensure that individuals are free to raise complaints of potential\nEEO violations or engage in other EEO activity without employers taking\nmaterially adverse actions in response.**\nRetaliation occurs when an employer takes a materially adverse action because\nan individual has engaged, or may engage, in activity in furtherance of the\nEEO laws the Commission enforces.[4] Each of the EEO laws prohibits\nretaliation and related conduct: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(Title VII),[5] the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),[6] Title V of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),[7] Section 501 of the\nRehabilitation Act (Section 501),[8] the Equal Pay Act (EPA),[9] and Title II\nof the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA).[10] These statutory\nprovisions prohibit government or private employers, employment agencies, and\nlabor organizations[11] from retaliating because an individual engaged in\n\"protected activity.\"[12] Generally, protected activity consists of either\nparticipating in an EEO process or opposing conduct made unlawful by an EEO\nlaw.\n _Section II_ of this guidance explains the concepts of participation and\nopposition, what types of employer actions can be challenged as retaliation,\nand the legal standards for determining whether the employer's action was\ncaused by retaliation in a given case.\n _Section III_ addresses the additional ADA prohibition of \"interference\" with\nthe exercise of rights under the ADA.[13] The interference provision goes\nbeyond the retaliation prohibition to make it also unlawful to coerce,\nintimidate, threaten, or otherwise interfere with an individual's exercise of\nany right under the ADA, or with an individual who is assisting another to\nexercise ADA rights.\n _Section IV_ addresses remedies, and _Section V_ addresses promising\npractices for preventing retaliation or interference.\nThe breadth of these anti-retaliation protections does not mean that employees\ncan immunize themselves from consequences for poor performance or improper\nbehavior by raising an internal EEO allegation or filing a discrimination\nclaim with an enforcement agency. Employers remain free to discipline or\nterminate employees for legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory\nreasons, notwithstanding any prior protected activity.[14] Whether an adverse\naction was taken because of the employee's protected activity depends on the\nfacts. If a manager recommends an adverse action in the wake of an employee's\nfiling of an EEOC charge or other protected activity, the employer may reduce\nthe chance of potential retaliation by independently evaluating whether the\nadverse action is appropriate.\nShort companion publications on retaliation are available on the EEOC's\nwebsite:\n _Questions and Answers: Enforcement Guidance on Retaliation and Related\nIssues_ https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/retaliation-qa.cfm\n _Small Business Fact Sheet: Retaliation and Related Issues_\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/retaliation-factsheet.cfm\nA retaliation claim challenging action taken because of EEO-related activity\nhas three elements:\nThe first question when analyzing a claim that a materially adverse action was\nretaliatory is whether there was an earlier complaint or other EEO activity\nthat is protected by the law (known as \"protected activity\"). Protected\nactivity includes \"participating\" in an EEO process or \"opposing\"\ndiscrimination. These two types of protected activity arise directly from two\ndistinct statutory retaliation clauses that differ in scope. Participation in\nan EEO process is more narrowly defined to refer specifically to raising a\nclaim, testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding or hearing under the EEO laws, but it is very\nbroadly protected. By contrast, opposition activity encompasses a broader\nrange of activity by which an individual opposes any practice made unlawful by\nthe EEO statutes. The protection for opposition is limited, however, to those\nindividuals who act with a reasonable good faith belief that a potential EEO\nviolation exists and who act in a reasonable manner to oppose it.\n **One type of protected activity is participation. An individual is protected\nfrom retaliation for having made a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under\nTitle VII, the ADEA, the EPA, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or GINA.\nParticipation may include, for example, filing or serving as a witness in an\nadministrative proceeding or lawsuit alleging discrimination.**\nThe anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to discriminate because an\nindividual has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any\nmanner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII, the ADEA,\nthe EPA, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or GINA. This language, known as the\n\"participation clause,\" provides protection from retaliation for many actions,\nincluding filing or serving as a witness for any side in an administrative\nproceeding or lawsuit alleging discrimination in violation of an EEO law.[16]\nThe participation clause applies even if the underlying allegation is not\nmeritorious or was not timely filed.[17]\nThe Commission has long taken the position that the participation clause\nbroadly protects EEO participation regardless of whether an individual has a\nreasonable, good faith belief that the underlying allegations are, or could\nbecome, unlawful conduct.[18] Although the Supreme Court has not addressed\nthis question, the participation clause by its terms contains no limiting\nlanguage, and protects from retaliation employees' participation in a\ncomplaint, investigation, or adjudication process.[19] In contrast to the\nopposition clause, which protects opposition to practices \"made . . .\nunlawful\" by the statute, and therefore requires a reasonable good faith\nbelief that conduct potentially violates the law, the participation clause\nprotects participating \"in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\nhearing\" under the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). As one appellate court\nexplained, \"[r]eading a reasonableness test into section 704(a)'s\nparticipation clause would do violence to the text of that provision and would\nundermine the objectives of Title VII.\"[20]\nThe Supreme Court has reasoned that broad participation protection is\nnecessary to achieve the primary statutory purpose of anti-retaliation\nprovisions, which is \"maintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial\nmechanisms.\"[21] The application of the participation clause cannot depend on\nthe substance of testimony because, \"[i]f a witness in [an EEO] proceeding\nwere secure from retaliation only when her testimony met some slippery\nreasonableness standard, she would surely be less than forth-coming.\"[22]\nThese protections ensure that individuals are not intimidated into forgoing\nthe complaint process, and that those investigating and adjudicating EEO\nallegations can obtain witnesses' unchilled testimony.[23] It also avoids pre-\njudging the merits of a given allegation. For these reasons, the Commission\ndisagrees with decisions holding to the contrary.[24]\nThis does not mean that bad faith actions taken in the course of participation\nare without consequence. False or bad faith statements by either the employee\nor the employer should be taken into appropriate account by the factfinder,\ninvestigator, or adjudicator of the EEO allegation when weighing credibility,\nruling on procedural matters, deciding on the scope of the factfinding\nprocess, and deciding if the claim has merit. It is the Commission's position,\nhowever, that an employer can be liable for retaliation if it takes it upon\nitself to impose consequences for actions taken in the course of\nparticipation.\nAlthough courts often limit the participation clause to administrative charges\nor lawsuits filed to enforce rights under an EEO statute, and instead\ncharacterize EEO complaints made internally (e.g., to a company manager or\nhuman resources department) as \"opposition,\"[25] the Supreme Court in\n_Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County_\nexplicitly left open the question of whether internal EEO complaints might be\nconsidered \"participation\" as well.[26] The Commission and the Solicitor\nGeneral have long taken the view that participation and opposition have some\noverlap, in that raising complaints, serving as a voluntary or involuntary\nwitness, or otherwise participating in an employer's internal complaint or\ninvestigation process, whether before or after an EEOC or Fair Employment\nPractices Agency (FEPA) charge has been filed, is covered under the broad\nprotections of the participation clause, although it is also covered as\n\"opposition.\"[27] The plain terms of the participation clause prohibit\nretaliation against those who \"participated _in any manner_ in _an_\ninvestigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under the statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2000e-3(a) (emphasis added). As courts have observed, these statutory terms\nare broad, unqualified, and not expressly limited to investigations conducted\nby the EEOC.[28] Similarly, contacting a federal agency employer's internal\nEEO Counselor under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105 to allege discrimination is\nparticipation.[29]\nThis application of the participation clause is supported by the Supreme\nCourt's decisions in _Faragher v. City of Boca Raton_ , 524 U.S. 775 (1998)\nand _Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth_ , 524 U.S. 742 (1998), which\ncreated an affirmative defense to discriminatory harassment liability based on\nthe availability and proper functioning of internal complaint and\ninvestigation processes. The adoption of such policies or the fact that an\nemployee unreasonably failed to utilize them governs liability for various\ntypes of harassment claims. An effective process necessitates that employees\nbe willing to participate, whether by providing information that is pro-\nemployer, pro-employee, or neutral. Such participation enables an employer to\ntake prompt corrective action where needed, and may later shield the employer\nfrom liability under the EEO laws.[30] It follows that participation in such\ncomplaint and investigation processes is participation in an \"investigation\"\nor \"proceeding\" within the meaning and interpretation of the statute.\n **In addition to participation, an individual is protected from retaliation\nfor opposing any practice made unlawful under the EEO laws. Protected\n\"opposition\" activity broadly includes the many ways in which an individual\nmay communicate explicitly or implicitly opposition to perceived employment\ndiscrimination. The manner of opposition must be reasonable, and the\nopposition must be based on a reasonable good faith belief that the conduct\nopposed is, or could become, unlawful.**\nThe EEO anti-retaliation provisions also make it unlawful to retaliate against\nan individual for opposing any practice made unlawful under the employment\ndiscrimination statutes.[31] Depending on the facts, the same conduct may\nqualify for protection as both \"participation\" and \"opposition.\" However, the\nopposition clause protects a broader range of conduct than the participation\nclause.\nThe opposition clause of Title VII has an \"expansive definition,\" and \"great\ndeference\" is given to the EEOC's interpretation of opposing conduct.[32] As\nthe Supreme Court stated in _Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville\nand Davidson County_ , \"'[w]hen an employee communicates to her employer a\nbelief that the employer has engaged in . . . a form of employment\ndiscrimination, that communication' _virtually always_ 'constitutes the\nemployee's _opposition_ to the activity.'\"[33] For example, accompanying a\ncoworker to the human resources office in order to file an internal EEO\ncomplaint,[34] or complaining to management about discrimination against\noneself or coworkers, likely constitutes protected activity.[35] Opposition\nincludes situations where \"an employee [takes] a stand against an employer's\ndiscriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say\nby refusing to follow a supervisor's order to fire a junior worker for\ndiscriminatory reasons.\"[36] It is also opposition when an employee who did\nnot initiate a complaint answers an employer's questions about potential\ndiscrimination.[37]\nThe opposition clause applies if an individual explicitly or implicitly\ncommunicates his or her belief that the matter complained of is, or could\nbecome, harassment or other discrimination.[38] The communication itself may\nbe informal and need not include the words \"harassment,\" \"discrimination,\" or\nany other legal terminology, as long as circumstances show that the individual\nis conveying opposition or resistance to a perceived potential EEO\nviolation.[39] Individuals may make broad or ambiguous complaints of unfair\ntreatment, in some instances because they may not know the specific\nrequirements of the anti-discrimination laws. Such communication is protected\nopposition if the complaint would reasonably have been interpreted as\nopposition to employment discrimination.\nAlthough the opposition clause applies broadly, it does not protect every\nprotest against perceived job discrimination. The following principles apply.\nCourts and the Commission balance the right to oppose employment\ndiscrimination against the employer's need to have a stable and productive\nwork environment. For this reason, the protection of the opposition clause\nonly applies where the _manner_ of opposition is reasonable.\n _Complaints to Someone Other Than Employer_. \"Courts have not limited the\nscope of the opposition clause to complaints made _to the employer_ ;\ncomplaints about the employer to others that the employer learns about can be\nprotected opposition.\"[40] Although opposition typically involves complaints\nto managers,[41] it may be a reasonable manner of opposition to inform others\nof alleged discrimination, including union officials, coworkers, an attorney,\nor others outside the company.[42] For instance, it is protected opposition\nfor an employee to contact the police seeking criminal prosecution of a\ncoworker who engaged in a workplace assault motivated by disability, race, or\nsex, even though it is not a complaint to a manager or to a government agency\nthat enforces EEO laws.[43]\n _Complaints Raised Publicly_. Depending on the circumstances, calling public\nattention to alleged discrimination may constitute reasonable opposition,\nprovided that it is connected to an alleged violation of the EEO laws.[44]\nOpposition may include even activities such as picketing.[45] It includes\nmaking informal or public protests against discrimination, \"including . . .\nwriting critical letters to customers, protesting against discrimination by\nindustry or society in general, and expressing support of coworkers who have\nfiled formal charges,\"[46] provided that it is not done in so disruptive or\nexcessive a manner as to be unreasonable.[47] Moreover, going outside a chain\nof command or prescribed internal complaint procedure in order to bring forth\ndiscrimination allegations may be reasonable.[48]\n _Advising Employer of Intent to File, or Complaining Before Matter is\nActionable_. It is also a reasonable manner of opposition for an employee\ncandidly to tell the employer of her intention to file a charge with the EEOC\nor a complaint with a state or local FEPA, union, court, employer's human\nresources department, higher-level manager, or company CEO. For example, where\nan employee intends to file an EEOC charge challenging a disparity in pay with\na male coworker as sex discrimination, disclosing this to her manager would be\nprotected opposition.[49] Moreover, it is reasonable opposition for an\nemployee to inform the employer about alleged or potential discrimination or\nharassment, even if the alleged harassment has not yet risen to the level of a\n\"severe or pervasive\" hostile work environment.[50]\n _Examples of Unreasonable Manner of Opposition_. On the other hand, it is not\nreasonable opposition if an employee, for example, makes an overwhelming\nnumber of patently specious complaints,[51] or badgers a subordinate employee\nto give a witness statement in support of an EEOC charge and attempts to\ncoerce her to change that statement.[52] The activity also will not be\nconsidered reasonable if it involves an unlawful act, such as committing or\nthreatening violence to life or property. These examples are not exhaustive;\nwhether the manner of opposition is unreasonable is a context- and fact-\nspecific inquiry.\nOpposition to perceived discrimination also does not serve as license for the\nemployee to neglect job duties. If an employee's protests render the employee\nineffective in the job, the retaliation provisions do not immunize the\nemployee from appropriate discipline or discharge.[53]\nAs with participation, a retaliation claim based on opposition is not defeated\nmerely because the underlying challenged practice ultimately is found to be\nlawful.[54] For statements or actions to be protected opposition, however,\nthey must be based on a reasonable good faith belief that the conduct opposed\nviolates the EEO laws, or could do so if repeated.[55] Because there is\nconduct that falls short of an actual violation but could be reasonably\nperceived to violate Title VII, the reasonable belief standard can apply to\nprotect complainants as well as witnesses or bystanders who intervene or\nreport what was observed.[56]\nAn employee complains to her office manager that her supervisor failed to\npromote her because of her sex after an apparently less qualified man was\nselected. Because the complaint was based on a reasonable good faith belief\nthat discrimination occurred, she has engaged in protected opposition\nregardless of whether the promotion decision was in fact discriminatory.\nSame as above, except the job sought by the employee was in accounting and it\nrequired a CPA license, which she lacked and the selectee had. She knew that\nit was necessary to have a CPA license to perform this job. She has not\nengaged in protected opposition because she did not have a reasonable good\nfaith belief that she was rejected because of sex discrimination.\nApplying the reasonable belief standard for opposition to alleged harassment\nin _Clark County School District v. Breeden_ , 532 U.S. 268 (2001) (per\ncuriam), the Supreme Court held that, on the particular facts of the case, no\nreasonable person could have believed that a male, serving with plaintiff on a\nhiring panel screening job applicants, had engaged in potential unlawful\nharassment when he, on one occasion, read aloud a job applicant's description\nof sexual conduct, stated that he did not know what it meant, and then laughed\nwhen another male employee said, \"I'll tell you later.\" The Court in _Breeden_\nnoted: \"The ordinary terms and conditions of the [plaintiff's] job required\nher to review the sexually explicit statement in the course of screening job\napplicants. Her coworkers who participated in the hiring process were subject\nto the same requirement,\" and the plaintiff \"conceded that it did not bother\nor upset her\" to read the statement in the application. Accordingly, the Court\nheld that the plaintiff's complaints about the incident did not constitute\nprotected opposition, and she could not maintain a retaliation claim under\nTitle VII.[57]\n _Breeden_ did not alter the well-established observation that \"[c]omplaining\nabout alleged sexual harassment to company management is classic opposition\nactivity.\"[58] Indeed, the hostile work environment liability standard is\npredicated on encouraging employees to \"report harassing conduct _before it\nbecomes severe or pervasive_.\"[59] In _Faragher_ , 524 U.S. 775, and _Ellerth_\n, 524 U.S. 742, the Supreme Court created an affirmative defense to\ndiscriminatory harassment liability based in part on an employee's failure \"to\ntake advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\nemployer.\"[60] It is well-recognized that \"the victim is compelled by the\n_Faragher/Ellerth_ defense to make an internal complaint.\"[61]\nIf an employee's internal complaint were not protected, therefore, an employee\nwould be in a catch-22: either complain to the employer about offensive\nconduct experienced or witnessed before it becomes severe or pervasive (taking\nthe risk that the employer would be permitted to fire her for complaining), or\nwait to complain until the harassment is so severe or pervasive that she is\ncertain she will be protected from retaliation (taking the risk of further\nharm, and that her failure to complain sooner will relieve the employer of\nliability even if a court later finds there was a hostile work environment).\nUnder _Faragher_ and _Ellerth_ , \"the victim is commanded to 'report the\nmisconduct, not investigate, gather evidence, and then approach company\nofficials.'\"[62]\nTherefore, even reporting an isolated single incident of harassment is\nprotected opposition if the employee \"reasonably believes that a hostile work\nenvironment is in progress, with no requirement for additional evidence that a\nplan is in motion to create such an environment or that such an environment is\nlikely to occur.\"[63] Likewise, it is protected opposition if the employee\ncomplains about offensive conduct that, if repeated often enough, would result\nin an actionable hostile work environment.[64]\nIt is reasonable for an employee to believe conduct violates the EEO laws if\nthe Commission, as the primary agency charged with enforcement, has adopted\nthat interpretation.[65]\nAn employee believes he is being harassed by coworkers based on his sexual\norientation, and complains to his manager and human resources. This is\nprotected activity under Title VII because, in light of the EEOC's stated\nlegal position and enforcement efforts, it is reasonable for an individual to\nbelieve that sexual orientation discrimination is actionable as sex\ndiscrimination under Title VII.[66]\nIn the Commission's view, all employees who engage in opposition activity are\nprotected from retaliation, even if they are managers, human resources\npersonnel, or other EEO advisors.[67] The statutory purpose of the opposition\nclause is promoted by protecting all communications about potential EEO\nviolations by the very officials most likely to discover, investigate, and\nreport them; otherwise, there would be a disincentive for them to do so.[68]\nA managerial employee with a duty to report or investigate discrimination\nstill must satisfy the same requirements as any other employee alleging\nretaliation under the opposition clause - meeting the definition of\n\"opposition,\" using a manner of opposition that is reasonable, and having a\nreasonable good faith belief that the opposed practice is unlawful (or would\nbe if repeated), as well as proving a materially adverse action, the requisite\ncausation, and liability.[69]\n **Protected opposition includes actions such as: complaining or threatening\nto complain about alleged discrimination against oneself or others; providing\ninformation in an employer's internal investigation of an EEO matter; refusing\nto obey an order reasonably believed to be discriminatory; advising an\nemployer on EEO compliance; resisting sexual advances or intervening to\nprotect others; passive resistance (allowing others to express opposition);\nand requesting reasonable accommodation for disability or religion.**\nAn employee complains to her supervisor about graffiti in her workplace that\nis derogatory toward women. Although she does not specify that she believes\nthe graffiti creates a hostile work environment based on sex, her complaint\nreasonably would have been interpreted by the supervisor as opposition to sex\ndiscrimination, due to the sex-based content of the graffiti. The graffiti\ndoes not need to rise to the level of severe or pervasive hostile work\nenvironment harassment in order for her complaint to be reasonable opposition.\nAn employee who has not lodged any complaint of her own is identified as a\nwitness in an employer's internal investigation of a coworker's sexual\nharassment allegations. The employee is interviewed by the employer and\nprovides corroborating information about sexual harassment she witnessed\nand/or experienced. This is protected opposition, even though she has not\nlodged an internal complaint of her own.[71]\nRefusing to obey an order constitutes protected opposition if the individual\nreasonably believes that the order requires him or her to carry out unlawful\nemployment discrimination. Protected opposition also includes refusal to\nimplement a discriminatory policy.[72]\nPlaintiff, who works for an employment agency referring individuals to fill\ntemporary and permanent positions with corporate clients, is instructed by his\nmanager not to refer any African Americans to a particular client per the\nclient's request. Plaintiff tells the manager this would be discriminatory,\nand proceeds instead to refer employees to this client on an equal opportunity\nbasis. Plaintiff's refusal to obey the order constitutes \"opposition\" to an\nunlawful employment practice.[73]\n  \nXYZ Corp.'s human resources manager came to believe that the company was\nimproperly denying certain requested reasonable accommodations to which\nindividuals with disabilities were entitled under the ADA. Shortly after she\nreported this to supervisory management, her employment was terminated. Even\nthough her reports to supervisors fell within the ambit of her managerial\nduties, her reports of unlawful company actions were protected opposition.\nProtected activity includes EEO complaints by managers, human resources staff,\nand EEO advisors - even when those complaints happen to grow out of the\nindividual's job duties - provided the complaint meets all the other relevant\nrequirements for protected activity.[74]\nIn response to a supervisor's repeated sexual comments to her, an employee\ntells the supervisor \"leave me alone\" and \"stop it.\" A coworker intervenes on\nher behalf, also asking the manager to stop. The employee's resistance and the\ncoworker's intervention both constitute protected opposition. A materially\nadverse action by the supervisor in retaliation would be actionable.[75]\nPassive opposition refers to certain acts that allow others to express\nopposition, such as refusing to implement an instruction to interfere with\nother employees' complaints. Such an action may itself be protected under the\nopposition clause.\nA supervisor does not carry out his management's instruction to dissuade his\nsubordinates from filing discrimination complaints. The supervisor's refusal\nis protected opposition, and a materially adverse action by management against\nthe supervisor because of his refusal to prevent complaints would be\nactionable retaliation.[76]\nA request for reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected\nactivity under the ADA, and therefore retaliation for such requests is\nunlawful.[77] By the same rationale, persons requesting religious\naccommodation under Title VII are protected against retaliation for making\nsuch requests.[78] Although a person making such a request might not literally\n\"oppose\" discrimination or \"participate\" in a complaint process, the\nindividual is protected against retaliation for making the request. One court\nexplained: \"It would seem anomalous . . . to think Congress intended no\nretaliation protection for employees who request a reasonable accommodation\nunless they also file a formal charge. This would leave employees unprotected\nif an employer granted the accommodation and shortly thereafter terminated the\nemployee in retaliation.\"[79]\nAfter a retail employee's supervisor denies her request to wear her religious\nheadscarf as an exception to the new uniform policy, the corporate human\nresources department instructs the supervisor to grant the request because\nthere is no undue hardship. Angry about being overruled, the supervisor\nthereafter gives the employee an unjustified poor performance rating and\ndenies her request to attend training that he approves for her coworkers. The\nemployee's request for an exception as a religious accommodation was protected\nactivity, and the supervisor's action in response is retaliation in violation\nof Title VII.\n **Federal protections for inquiring about or otherwise discussing\ncompensation information include, among others: protections enforced by the\nEEOC that prohibit retaliation for protected activity; protections enforced by\nthe U.S. Department of Labor that prohibit discrimination by federal\ncontractors and subcontractors for discussing compensation; and protections\nenforced by the National Labor Relations Board for discussion of wages as\nconcerted activity.**\nTaking adverse action for discussing compensation may implicate the EEO anti-\nretaliation protections as well as a number of other federal laws, some\nexamples of which follow in order to illustrate how related authorities apply.\nAdditional protections exist under various state laws.[80]\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, approximately 60% of private sector\nworkers surveyed nationally reported that they were either contractually\nforbidden or strongly discouraged by management from discussing their pay with\ntheir colleagues.[81] Although most private employers are under no obligation\nto make wage information public, actions taken by an employer to prohibit\nemployees from discussing their compensation with one another may impede\nknowledge of discrimination and deter protected activity, whether pursuant to\na so-called \"pay secrecy\" policy or other employer action.\nWhen an employee communicates to management or coworkers to complain or ask\nabout compensation, or otherwise discusses rates of pay, the communication may\nconstitute protected opposition under the EEO laws, making employer\nretaliation actionable based upon the facts of a given case. For example,\ntalking to coworkers to gather information or evidence in support of a\npotential EEO claim is protected opposition, provided the manner of opposition\nis reasonable.[82]\nA temporary custodian learns that she is being paid a dollar less per hour\nthan previously hired male counterparts. She approaches her supervisor and\nsays she believes they are \"breaking some sort of law\" by paying her lower\nwages than previously paid to male temporary custodians. This is protected\nopposition.[83] Similarly, it would be protected opposition if she had said \"I\ndon't think I am being paid fairly. Would you please tell me what men in this\njob are being paid?\"\nAn African-American employee discussed with coworkers her belief that she was\nbeing discriminated against based on race because her pay was lower than that\nof Caucasian employees doing similar work. Her employer then disciplined her\nfor engaging in discussions about suspected pay discrimination. The discipline\nconstitutes unlawful retaliation for protected opposition. The fact that the\nemployer has a \"Code of Conduct\" prohibiting discussions of pay would not\ninsulate it from liability for retaliation under Title VII.\nIn addition to the retaliation provisions of the laws enforced by the EEOC,\nthere are also various other federal protections for discussions related to\ncompensation that apply to certain employers. Two examples include Executive\nOrder (E.O.) 11246 and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\nUnder E.O. 11246, as amended by E.O. 13665 (April 8, 2014), federal\ncontractors and subcontractors are prohibited from discharging or otherwise\ndiscriminating in any way against employees or applicants who inquire about,\ndiscuss, or disclose their compensation or that of other employees or\napplicants.[84] This nondiscrimination requirement protects _any_ compensation\ninquiries, discussions, or disclosures. Neither opposition to alleged\ndiscrimination nor participation in EEO activity is a necessary element of a\npay transparency violation of E.O. 11246. Rather, the pay transparency\nprovisions protect even simple inquiries between coworkers about their\ncompensation, and generally prohibit contractors from having policies that\nprohibit or tend to restrict employees or applicants from discussing or\ndisclosing compensation.[85]\nThe Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) at the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor enforces E.O. 11246 and has issued regulations\nimplementing the pay transparency provisions of E.O. 13665, which became\neffective on January 11, 2016.[86] Though their protection is broad, the\nregulations contain two specific contractor defenses to a claim of pay\ntransparency discrimination. A contractor may show that it disciplined the\nemployee for violating a uniformly applied rule, policy, practice, or\nagreement that does not prohibit or tend to prohibit applicants or employees\nfrom discussing or disclosing compensation. A contractor may also show that it\ndisciplined an employee because the employee (a) had access to the\ncompensation information of other employees or applicants as part of his or\nher essential job duties, and (b) disclosed such information to individuals\nwho did not otherwise have access to it, unless the employee was discussing\nhis or her own compensation, or unless the disclosure occurred in certain\nspecified circumstances.[87]\nThe NLRA protects non-supervisory employees who are covered by that law from\nemployer retaliation when they discuss their wages or working conditions with\ntheir colleagues as part of a concerted activity, even if there is no union or\nother formal organization involved in the effort.[88] The NLRA prohibits\nemployers from discriminating against employees and job applicants who discuss\nor disclose their own compensation or the compensation of other employees or\napplicants. The NLRA protection, however, does not extend to supervisors,\nmanagers, agricultural workers, and employees of rail and air carriers. More\ninformation about the scope of the NLRA protections, charge filing, and\ncompliance and enforcement can be found on the National Labor Relations\nBoard's website at https://www.nlrb.gov.\n **Anti-retaliation protections extend to many individuals, including those\nwho make formal or informal allegations of EEO violations (whether or not\nsuccessful), those who serve as witnesses or participate in investigations,\nthose who exercise rights such as requesting religious or disability\naccommodation, and even those who are retaliated against after their\nemployment relationship ends.**\nAs the above discussion illustrates, protected activity can take many forms.\nIndividuals who engage in protected activity include:\nIn addition, those whom an employer mistakenly believes have engaged in\nprotected activity are protected from retaliation.[99] _See also_ _infra_ \u00a7\nII.B.4. (Third Party Retaliation).\n **Retaliation expansively reaches any action that is \"materially adverse,\"\nmeaning any action that might well deter a reasonable person from engaging in\nprotected activity.**\nThe anti-retaliation provisions make it unlawful to take a materially adverse\naction against an individual because of protected activity. The Supreme Court\nheld in _Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White_, 548 U.S. 53\n(2006), that a \"materially adverse action\" subject to challenge under the\nanti-retaliation provisions encompasses a broader range of actions than an\n\"adverse action\" subject to challenge under the non-discrimination\nprovisions.[100] In light of the purpose of anti-retaliation protection, it\nexpansively covers any employer action that \"might well deter a reasonable\nemployee from complaining about discrimination.\"[101] An action need not be\nmaterially adverse standing alone, as long as the employer's retaliatory\nconduct, considered as a whole, would deter protected activity.[102] Although\n\"normally petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners\nwill not create such deterrence,\" the standard can be satisfied even if the\nindividual was not in fact deterred.[103]\nThe _Burlington Northern_ decision made clear that whether an action is\nreasonably likely to deter protected activity depends on the surrounding facts\n- although the standard is \"objective,\" it is phrased in \"general terms\"\nbecause the \"significance of any given act will often depend on the particular\ncircumstances. Context matters.\"[104] An \"act that would be immaterial in some\nsituations is material in others.\"[105] Indeed, the Supreme Court has held\nthat transferring plaintiff to a harder, dirtier job within the same pay grade\nand job category and suspending her without pay for 37 days even though the\nlost pay was later reimbursed, were both \"materially adverse actions\" that\ncould be challenged as retaliation.[106] Other examples of actionable\nretaliation cited by the Supreme Court include the FBI's refusing to\ninvestigate \"death threats\" against an agent, the filing of false criminal\ncharges against a former employee, changing the work schedule of a parent who\nhas caretaking responsibilities for school-age children, and excluding an\nemployee from a weekly training lunch that contributes to professional\nadvancement.[107]\nThis broad definition of \"materially adverse\" from _Burlington Northern_\napplies not only to private and state and local government employment, but\nalso to federal sector employment under all the statutes enforced by the\nEEOC.[108]\n _Work-Related Actions_. The most obvious types of adverse actions are denial\nof promotion, refusal to hire, denial of job benefits, demotion, suspension,\nand discharge.[109] Other types of adverse actions may include work-related\nthreats,[110] warnings, reprimands,[111] transfers,[112] negative or lowered\nevaluations,[113] transfers to less prestigious or desirable work[114] or work\nlocations,[115] and any other type of adverse treatment that in the\ncircumstances might well dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in\nprotected activity. For example, as one appellate court observed, \"[a] formal\nreprimand issued by an employer is not a 'petty slight,' 'minor annoyance,' or\n'trivial' punishment; it can reduce an employee's likelihood of receiving\nfuture bonuses, raises, and promotions, and it may lead the employee to\nbelieve (correctly or not) that his job is in jeopardy.\"[116] Another court of\nappeals reasoned that the same can be said of lowered performance appraisals:\nIf the Supreme Court views excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch\nthat contributes significantly to the employee's professional development as\nmaterially adverse conduct, _see Burlington_ [ _Northern & Santa Fe Railway\nCo. v. White,_ 548 U.S. 53, 69 (2006)], then markedly lower performance-\nevaluation scores that significantly impact an employee's wages or\nprofessional advancement are also materially adverse.[117]\n _Actions That Are Not Work-Related_. A materially adverse action may also be\nan action that has no tangible effect on employment, or even an action that\ntakes place exclusively outside of work, as long as it might well dissuade a\nreasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Prohibiting only\nemployment-related actions would not achieve the goal of avoiding retaliation\nbecause \"an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking\nactions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm\n_outside_ the workplace.\"[118] The Supreme Court in _Burlington Northern_\nobserved that, although the substantive anti-discrimination provisions seek\nelimination of discrimination that affects employment opportunities because of\nemployees' racial, ethnic, or other protected status, the anti-retaliation\nprovisions seek to secure that objective by preventing an employer from\ninterfering in a materially adverse way with efforts to enforce the law's\nbasic guarantees.[119]\n _Additional Examples_. Other examples of materially adverse actions may\ninclude:\nA fact-driven analysis applies to determine if the challenged employer\naction(s) in question would be likely to deter participation or opposition. To\nthe extent some lower courts applying _Burlington Northern_ have found that\nsome of the above-listed actions can never be significant enough to deter\nprotected activity, the Commission concludes that such a categorical view is\ncontrary to the context-specific analysis, broad reasoning, and specific\nexamples endorsed by the Supreme Court.\nMatters are not actionable as retaliation if they are not likely to dissuade\nan employee from engaging in protected activity in the circumstances. For\nexample, courts have concluded on the facts of given cases that a temporary\ntransfer from an office to a cubicle consistent with office policy was not a\nmaterially adverse action[128] and that occasional brief delays by an employer\nin issuing refund checks to an employee that involved small amounts of money\nwere not materially adverse.[129] Such actions were not deemed likely to deter\nprotected activity, as distinguished from the transfer to harder work, the\nexclusion from a weekly training lunch, or the unfavorable schedule change\ndescribed by the Supreme Court in _Burlington Northern_ as materially adverse.\nIf the employer's action would be reasonably likely to deter protected\nactivity, it can be challenged as retaliation even if it falls short of its\ngoal.[130] The degree of harm suffered by the individual \"goes to the issue of\ndamages, not liability.\"[131] Regardless of the degree or quality of harm to\nthe particular complainant, retaliation harms the public interest by deterring\nothers from filing charges.[132] An interpretation of Title VII that permits\nsome forms of retaliation to go unpunished would undermine the effectiveness\nof the EEO statutes and conflict with the language and purpose of the anti-\nretaliation provisions.\nDetermining whether an action is reasonably likely to deter protected activity\nunder _Burlington Northern_ is fact-dependent.\nA federal agency employee filed a formal complaint with her agency EEO office\nalleging that she was denied a promotion by her supervisor because of her sex.\nOne week later, her supervisor invited a few other employees out to lunch. She\nbelieved that her supervisor excluded her from lunch because of her complaint.\nEven if the supervisor chose not to invite the employee because of her\ncomplaint, this would not constitute unlawful retaliation because it is not\nreasonably likely to deter protected activity. By contrast, if her supervisor\ninvited all employees in her unit to regular weekly lunches, and she is\nexcluded because she files the sex discrimination complaint, this might\nconstitute unlawful retaliation since it could reasonably deter her or others\nfrom engaging in protected activity.[133]\nAn employee filed an EEOC charge alleging that he was racially harassed by his\nsupervisor and coworkers. He also alleged that, after he had complained to\nmanagement about the harassment, his supervisor asked two coworkers to conduct\nsurveillance on the employee and report back about his activities. The\nsurveillance constitutes a materially adverse action because it is likely to\ndeter protected activity, and it is unlawful if it was conducted because of\nthe employee's protected activity.\nA contractor employs farm workers and other laborers whom it places in rural\nagricultural and manufacturing facilities operated by its corporate clients.\nTogether, the contractor and these facilities are joint employers under the\nEEO laws. The contractor and its clients suspect that many of the employees\nmay be undocumented workers but, in order to meet their staffing needs, they\ndo not attempt to verify their authorization to work as required by the\nimmigration laws. Several of the female farm workers and laborers, who are in\nfact undocumented, complain to a client supervisor and to the contractor about\nsexual harassment by male coworkers, including physical assaults and\npersistent unwelcome sexual remarks and advances. The client supervisor and\nthe contractor threaten to expose the workers' immigration status if they\ncontinue to complain about the harassment. Threatening to report the workers'\nsuspected immigration status to government authorities, or actually reporting\nthe workers, is materially adverse and actionable as retaliation against\nworkers who have engaged in protected activity under the EEO laws because it\nis likely to deter them from engaging in protected activity. If an EEOC charge\nis filed, both the contractor and the facility owner can each be found liable\nfor retaliation. Neither the workers' undocumented status, nor the fact that\nthey were placed by a contractor acting as a staffing firm, is a defense.[134]\nAfter an employee cooperated in a workplace investigation of a coworker's race\ndiscrimination complaint, a supervisor intentionally left a window ajar to\nprevent the employee from setting the building alarm (one of his job duties)\nand thereby subjected him to discipline. The supervisor also engaged in\npunitive scheduling, including shortening off-duty time between workdays and\nchanging the employee's work schedule in a way that would require him to work\nalone at a more dangerous facility than the one at which he usually worked.\nThese acts of workplace sabotage, his assignment to an unfavorable location,\nand the punitive scheduling constitute materially adverse actions.[135]\nThree weeks after a federal employee sought EEO counseling regarding her\ncomplaint of disability and gender discrimination, her supervisor posted the\nEEO complaint on the agency's intranet where coworkers accessed it. The\nsupervisor also increased her workload to five or six times that of other\nemployees. Both of the supervisor's actions are materially adverse and\nactionable as alleged retaliation.[136]\nSometimes retaliatory conduct is characterized as \"retaliatory harassment.\"\nThe threshold for establishing retaliatory harassment is different than for\ndiscriminatory hostile work environment. Retaliatory harassing conduct can be\nchallenged under the _Burlington Northern_ standard even if it is not severe\nor pervasive enough to alter the terms and conditions of employment.[137] If\nthe conduct would be sufficiently material to deter protected activity in the\ngiven context, even if it were insufficiently severe or pervasive to create a\nhostile work environment, there would be actionable retaliation.\nSometimes an employer takes a materially adverse action against an employee\nwho engaged in protected activity by harming a third party who is closely\nrelated to or associated with the complaining employee.[138] For example, the\nSupreme Court explained that it is \"obvious that a reasonable worker might be\ndissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc\u00e9\nwould be fired.\"[139] Similarly, if an employer punishes an employee for\nengaging in protected activity by cancelling a vendor contract with the\nemployee's husband (even though he was employed by a contractor, not the\nemployer), it would dissuade a reasonable worker from engaging in protected\nactivity.[140] Although there is no \"fixed class of relationships for which\nthird-party reprisals are unlawful[,] . . . firing a close family member will\nalmost always meet the _Burlington_ standard, and inflicting a milder reprisal\non a mere acquaintance will almost never do so.\"[141]\nWhere there is actionable third party retaliation, both the employee who\nengaged in the protected activity and the third party who is subjected to the\nmaterially adverse action may state a claim. The third party may bring a claim\neven if he did not engage in the protected activity, and even if he has never\nbeen employed by the defendant employer. \"Regardless of whether the plaintiffs\nare employed by the defendant, . . . the harm they suffered is no less a\nproduct of the defendant's purposeful violation of the anti-retaliation\nprovision.\"[142] As the Supreme Court stated, the third party was not an\n\"accidental victim\"; \"[t]o the contrary, injuring him was the employer's\nintended means of harming the [employee who engaged in protected\nactivity].\"[143] Thus, the third party \"falls within the 'zone of interests'\nsought to be protected by [the retaliation provision]\" and has standing to\nseek recovery from the employer for his harm.[144]\n **A materially adverse action does not violate the EEO laws unless there is a\ncausal connection between the action and the protected activity.**\nUnlawful retaliation is established when a causal connection is established\nbetween a materially adverse action and the individual's protected activity.\nThe retaliatory animus need not necessarily be held by the employer's official\nwho took the materially adverse action; an employer still may be vicariously\nliable if one of its agents, motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory\nanimus, intentionally and proximately caused the official to take the\naction.[145] A retaliation claim will not succeed absent enough evidence to\nprove retaliation under the applicable causation standard.\nIn private sector and state and local government retaliation cases under the\nstatutes the EEOC enforces, the causation standard requires the evidence to\nshow that \"but for\" a retaliatory motive, the employer would not have taken\nthe adverse action, as set forth by the Supreme Court in _University of Texas\nSouthwest Medical Center v. Nassar_.[146] By contrast, the \"motivating factor\"\ncausation standard for discrimination claims can be met even if the employer\nwould have taken the same action absent a discriminatory motive.[147]\nThe \"but-for\" causation standard does not require that retaliation be the\n\"sole cause\" of the action. There can be multiple \"but-for\" causes, and\nretaliation need only be \" _a_ but-for\" cause of the materially adverse action\nin order for the employee to prevail.[148]The Supreme Court has explained how\n\"but-for\" causation can be demonstrated even if multiple causes exist:\n\"[W]here A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say that A [actually] caused\nB's death, since but for A's conduct B would not have died.\" _LaFave_ 467-468\n(italics omitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act combines\nwith other factors to produce the result, so long as the other factors alone\nwould not have done so-if, so to speak, it was the straw that broke the\ncamel's back. Thus, if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those diseases played a\npart in his demise, so long as, without the incremental effect of the poison,\nhe would have lived.[149]\nBy contrast, in federal sector Title VII and ADEA retaliation cases, the\nCommission has held that the \"but-for\" standard does not apply because the\nrelevant federal sector statutory provisions do not employ the same language\non which the Court based its holding in _Nassar_.[150] The federal sector\nprovisions contain a \"broad prohibition of 'discrimination' rather than a list\nof specific prohibited practices,\" requiring that employment \"be made free\nfrom any discrimination,\" including retaliation. Therefore, in Title VII and\nADEA cases against a federal employer, retaliation is prohibited if it was a\nmotivating factor.[151]\nIn order for the employee to prevail in demonstrating a violation, the\nevidence must show that it is more likely than not that retaliation has\noccurred. It is not the employer's burden to disprove the claim.[152]\nThere are instances in which the evidence demonstrates that the employer\nacknowledges or betrays a retaliatory motive for its materially adverse\naction, orally or in writing.[153] In many cases, however, the employer\nproffers a non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action. For example, the\nemployer may assert that it could not have been motivated by retaliation\nbecause it was not aware of the protected activity,[154] or that even if it\nwas aware the employee made complaints, it did not know that they concerned\ndiscrimination.[155] Or, an employer may contend that it was not motivated by\nretaliation but by a legitimate unrelated reason, such as: poor job\nperformance or misconduct;[156] inadequate qualifications for the position\nsought;[157] or, with regard to negative job references, truthfulness of the\ninformation in the reference.[158]\nThere may be proof that the employer's asserted non-retaliatory explanation is\npretextual, such as evidence that the former employer routinely declines to\noffer information about its former employees' job performance but departed\nfrom that policy with regard to an individual who engaged in protected\nactivity.[159] If an employer's proffered explanation is shown to be false, a\nfactfinder may infer retaliation or alternatively may conclude that the\nfalsehood was given for a different reason (e.g., to cover up embarrassing\nfacts). This determination must be made based on the totality of the evidence.\nAn employee alleges that she was denied a promotion because she opposed the\nunder-representation of women in management jobs and was therefore viewed as a\n\"troublemaker.\" The employer asserts that the selectee was better qualified\nfor the job because she has a master's degree, whereas the employee only has a\nbachelor's degree. If the employee has significantly greater experience\nworking at this company and experience has long been the company's most\nimportant criterion for selecting managers, this explanation may be found to\nbe a pretext for retaliation.\nDifferent types or pieces of evidence, either alone or in combination, may be\nrelevant to determine if the above causation standard has been met. In other\nwords, different pieces of evidence, considered together, may allow an\ninference that the materially adverse action was retaliatory.[160]\nThe evidence may include, for example, suspicious timing, verbal or written\nstatements, comparative evidence that a similarly situated employee was\ntreated differently, falsity of the employer's proffered reason for the\nadverse action, or any other pieces of evidence which, when viewed together,\nmay permit an inference of retaliatory intent.[161]\n _Suspicious timing._ The causal link between the adverse action and the\nprotected activity is often established by evidence that the adverse action\noccurred shortly after the plaintiff engaged in protected activity.[162]\nHowever, temporal proximity is not necessary to establish a causal link.[163]\nEven when the time between the protected activity and the adverse action is\nlengthy, other evidence of retaliatory motive may establish the causal\nlink.[164] For example, actions related to the continued processing of a\ncomplaint may remind an employer of its pendency or stoke an employer's\nanimus. Moreover, an opportunity to engage in a retaliatory act may not arise\nright away. In these circumstances, a materially adverse action might occur\nlong after the original protected activity occurs, and retaliatory motive is\nnevertheless proven.[165]\n _Oral or written statements_. Oral or written statements made by the\nindividuals recommending or approving the challenged adverse action may reveal\nretaliatory intent by expressing retaliatory animus or by revealing\ninconsistencies, pre-determined decisions, or other indications that the\nreasons given for the adverse action are false.[166] Such statements may have\nbeen made to the employee or to others.[167]\n _Comparative evidence_. An inference that the adverse action was motivated by\nretaliation could also be supported by evidence that the employer treated more\nfavorably a similarly situated employee who had not engaged in protected\nactivity. For example, where a disciplinary action was taken for alleged\nretaliatory reasons, evidence of selective enforcement (i.e., that infraction\nregularly goes undisciplined in that workplace, or that another employee who\ncommitted the same infraction was not disciplined, or was not disciplined as\nseverely) could be sufficient to infer retaliatory motive.[168] Similarly,\nabsent evidence of new performance problems, a retaliatory motive might be\ninferred where an employee had higher performance appraisals prior to engaging\nin protected activity.[169]\n _Inconsistent or shifting explanations_. If the employer changes its stated\nreason for the challenged adverse action over time or in different settings\n(e.g., reasons stated to employee in termination meeting differ from reasons\nemployer cites in position statement filed with the EEOC), pretext may be\ninferred.[170] The inference of discrimination drawn from such changes,\nhowever, will be undermined to the extent the inconsistencies are innocuous or\ncan be credibly explained by the employer (e.g., additional information is\ndiscovered).\n _Other evidence that employer's explanation was pretextual_. There may be\nother evidence that the employer's justification for the challenged action is\nnot believable and that the explanation is a pretext to hide retaliation.[171]\nAn employee files a suit against company A, alleging that her supervisor\nsexually harassed and constructively discharged her. The suit is ultimately\nsettled. She applies for a new job with company B and receives a conditional\noffer subject to a reference check. When B calls A, the employee's former\nsupervisor says that she was a \"troublemaker,\" started a sex harassment\nlawsuit, and was not anyone B \"would want to get mixed up with.\" B then\nwithdraws its conditional offer. These statements support the conclusion that\nbecause of the employee's prior sexual harassment allegation, A provided a\nnegative job reference and B rescinded its job offer. Both A and B can be\nliable for retaliation.\nJane, a saleswoman, has been employed at a retail store for more than a\ndecade, and has always exceeded her sales quota and received excellent\nperformance appraisals. Shortly after the company learned that Jane had\nprovided a witness statement to the EEOC in support of a coworker's sexual\nharassment claim, it terminated Jane, citing her failure to provide 48-hours\nadvance notice to her supervisor about a shift swap with a coworker. She\nalleges retaliatory termination, and evidence reveals that same-day notice of\nshift swap was a widespread company practice that had commonly been permitted.\nThis evidence, in combination with the proximity in time of her discharge to\nthe company's learning of her protected activity, could support the conclusion\nthat the discharge was retaliatory.\nEven if protected activity and a materially adverse action occurred, evidence\nof any of the following facts alone or in combination may be credited by the\nfactfinder in a given case and, as a result, lead to the conclusion that the\naction was not in retaliation for the protected activity under the applicable\ncausation standard.\n _Employer Unaware of Protected Activity_. Retaliation cannot be shown without\nestablishing that the employer (either the decisionmaker or someone who\ninfluenced the decisionmaker) knew of the prior protected activity.[172]\nAbsent knowledge, there can be no retaliatory intent, and therefore no causal\nconnection.[173]\n _Legitimate Non-Retaliatory Reason for Challenged Action_. An employer may\nproffer a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action.\nExamples of non-retaliatory reasons include:\nThough the employer does not have the burden to disprove retaliation, the\nemployer may have evidence supporting its proffered explanation for the\nchallenged action, such as comparative evidence revealing like treatment of\nsimilarly situated individuals who did not engage in protected activity, or\nsupporting documentary and/or witness testimony.\nAn employee alleges that his former private sector employer gave him a\nnegative job reference because he had filed an EEO discrimination claim after\nbeing terminated. The employer produces evidence that it usually provides\ninformation about previous employees' job performance and that its negative\nstatements to the prospective employer were honest assessments of the former\nemployee's job performance. Unless it can be concluded that the negative\nreference was because of the discrimination claim, retaliation would not be\nfound.\nPlaintiff, the office manager of a service company, believed her non-selection\nfor various managerial positions was due to sex discrimination, and she posted\non an online social media platform, \"anyone know a good EEO lawyer? need one\nnow.\" Management saw this and shared it with human resources. Plaintiff was\nsubsequently discharged and alleged it was retaliatory. However, the evidence\nshowed the termination was due to Plaintiff's extensive unauthorized use of\novertime and her repeated violations of company finance procedures, which were\nenforced for other employees, and for which Plaintiff had been previously\nissued written discipline. Even though management was aware of Plaintiff's\nprotected activity (her intention to take action on a potential EEO claim),\nPlaintiff cannot prove retaliatory discharge.\n _Evidence of Retaliatory Motive But Adverse Action Would Have Happened\nAnyway_. In a case where the \"but for\" standard applies, the claim will fail\nunless retaliation was a \"but-for\" cause of the adverse action. In other\nwords, causation cannot be proven if the evidence shows that the challenged\nadverse action would have occurred anyway, even without a retaliatory motive.\nA private sector employee alleges retaliatory termination. The evidence shows\nthat management admitted to being \"mad\" at the employee for filing a prior\nreligious discrimination charge, but this was not enough to show that her\nprotected activity was a \"but-for\" cause of her termination, where she was\nfired for her repeated violations of workplace safety rules and for\ninsubordination. The employee admitted to repeatedly violating the rules and\nto being uncooperative with her supervisor. Further, the evidence shows that\nthe employee was warned prior to her filing the EEO claim that her continued\nviolation of the safety rules could result in her termination.[174]\n **The ADA prohibits not just retaliation, but also \"interference\" with the\nexercise or enjoyment of ADA rights. The interference provision is broader\nthan the anti-retaliation provision, protecting any individual who is subject\nto coercion, threats, intimidation, or interference with respect to ADA\nrights.**\nIn addition to retaliation, the ADA prohibits \"interference\" with the exercise\nor enjoyment of ADA rights, or with the assistance of another in exercising or\nenjoying those rights.[175] The scope of the interference provision is broader\nthan the anti-retaliation provision. It protects any individual who is subject\nto coercion, threats, intimidation, or interference with respect to ADA\nrights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(b).[176] As with ADA retaliation, an applicant or\nemployee need not establish that he is an \"individual with a disability\" or\n\"qualified\" in order to prove interference under the ADA\nThe statute, regulations, and court decisions have not separately defined the\nterms \"coerce,\" \"intimidate,\" \"threaten,\" and \"interfere.\" Rather, as a group,\nthese terms have been interpreted to include at least certain types of actions\nwhich, whether or not they rise to the level of unlawful retaliation, are\nnevertheless actionable as interference.[177]\nOf course, many instances of employer threats or coercion might in and of\nthemselves be actionable under the ADA as a denial of accommodation,\ndiscrimination, or retaliation, and many examples in this section could be\nactionable under those theories of liability as well. Because the\n\"interference\" provision is broader, however, it will reach even those\ninstances when conduct does not meet the \"materially adverse\" standard\nrequired for retaliation. Examples of conduct by an employer prohibited under\nthe ADA as interference would include:\nThe interference provision does not apply to any and all conduct or statements\nthat an individual finds intimidating.[178] In the Commission's view, it only\nprohibits conduct that is reasonably likely to interfere with the exercise or\nenjoyment of ADA rights.[179]\nJoe, a mail room employee with an intellectual disability, is having\ndifficulty remembering the supervisor's instructions that are delivered orally\nat morning staff meetings. Dave, a coworker, explains to Joe that he may be\nentitled to written instructions as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA\nand then takes Joe to the human resources department to assist him in\nrequesting accommodation. When the supervisor learns what has happened, he is\nannoyed that he may have to do \"more work\" by providing written instructions,\nand he tells Dave that if he continues to \"stir things up\" by \"putting foolish\nideas in Joe's head\" with this \"accommodation business,\" he will regret it.\nThe supervisor's threat against Dave for assisting another employee in\nexercising his ADA rights can constitute interference.\nWhen reviewing medical information received in support of an employee's\nrequest for accommodation of her depression, the employer learns that,\nalthough the employee's physician had previously prescribed a medication that\nmight eliminate the need for the requested accommodation, the employee chose\nnot to take the medication because of its side effects. The employer advises\nthe employee that if she does not try the medication first, he will not\nconsider the accommodation. The employer's actions constitute both denial of\nreasonable accommodation and interference in violation of the ADA.\nA threat does not have to be carried out in order to violate the interference\nprovision, and an individual does not actually have to be deterred from\nexercising or enjoying ADA rights in order for the interference to be\nactionable.\nAn employee with a vision disability needs special technology in order to use\na computer at work. She requests paid administrative leave as an accommodation\nto visit an off-site vocational technology center with the employer's human\nresources manager in order to decide on appropriate equipment, as well as for\nseveral subsequent appointments at the center during which she will be trained\non the computer program selected. Her supervisor objects, but the human\nresources manager advises him that this is part of the process of\naccommodating the employee with the equipment under the ADA, and that the\nleave should be granted. The supervisor calls the employee into his office and\ntells her that he will allow it this time, but if she ever brings up the ADA\nagain, she \"will be sorry.\" The supervisor's threat constitutes interference\nwith the exercise of ADA rights in violation of the statute, even if not\naccompanied or followed by any adverse action.\nAfter a lengthy interactive process, an employee with multiple sclerosis is\ngranted a change in schedule as an accommodation. When her condition\nsubsequently worsens, she requests additional accommodations, including\ntelecommuting on days when her symptoms flare up and prevent her from walking.\nThe employer has a policy that prohibits telework. When her supervisor\nconsults human resources, he is advised that the ADA may require making an\nexception to the usual policy as a reasonable accommodation, unless it would\npose an undue hardship. Instead of proceeding with the interactive process,\nthe supervisor tells the employee that if she withdraws her request for\naccommodation, he will informally allow her to work from home one day per\nweek, but that, if she persists with her formal accommodation request, he will\ntell human resources that her job cannot be performed from home. The\nsupervisor's actions constitute interference in violation of the ADA.\nDue to post-traumatic stress disorder following a nighttime attack, an\nemployee is accommodated with shift assignments that assure that she can\ncommute to and from work during daytime hours. She is subsequently assigned a\nnew supervisor who threatens to have her transferred, demoted, or placed on\nmedical retirement if she does not work a \"normal schedule.\" Based on these\nfacts, the supervisor has violated the interference provision of the ADA.\nA job applicant declines an interviewer's request to submit to a pre-offer\nmedical examination, citing the ADA's prohibition against conducting medical\nexaminations prior to making a conditional offer of employment. The\ninterviewer refuses to consider the application without the examination, so\nthe applicant submits to it. Regardless of whether or not the applicant is\nqualified or is hired, the employer engaged in interference as well as an\nimproper disability-related examination in violation of the ADA.\nThe EEOC has the authority to seek temporary injunctive relief before final\ndisposition of a charge when a preliminary investigation indicates that prompt\njudicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of Title VII, and the\nADA and GINA incorporate this provision.[180] Although the ADEA and the EPA do\nnot authorize a court to give interim relief pending resolution of an EEOC\ncharge, the EEOC can seek such relief as part of a lawsuit for permanent\nrelief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nTemporary or preliminary relief allows a court to stop retaliation before it\noccurs or continues. Such relief is appropriate if there is a substantial\nlikelihood that the challenged action will be found to constitute unlawful\nretaliation and if the charging party and/or the public interest will likely\nsuffer irreparable harm because of the retaliation. Although courts have ruled\nthat financial hardships are not irreparable, other harms that accompany loss\nof a job may be irreparable. For example, courts have held that forced\nretirees showed irreparable harm and qualified for a preliminary injunction\nwhere they lost work and future prospects for work, consequently suffering\nemotional distress, depression, a contracted social life, and other related\nharms.[181]\nAn employee filed an enforcement action in court to obtain compliance with the\nrelief obtained in his Title VII national origin discrimination case. Within\ntwo months, his employer ordered him to transfer from its Los Angeles office\nto its facility in Detroit or be discharged. The court granted preliminary\nrelief to forestall the alleged retaliatory transfer and permit the employee\nto retain employment pending its adjudication of the merits.[182]\nA temporary injunction also is appropriate if the respondent's retaliation\nwill likely cause irreparable harm to the Commission's ability to investigate\nthe charging party's original charge of discrimination. For example, if the\nalleged retaliatory act might discourage others from providing testimony or\nfrom filing additional charges based on the same or other alleged unlawful\nacts, preliminary relief is justified.[183]\nDuring the EEOC's systemic investigation of sexual harassment at a large\nagricultural producer with many low-wage, seasonal employees, the Commission\nlearned that management was creating an environment of intimidation to deter\ncurrent and former employees from cooperating as witnesses. The court granted\nthe Commission preliminary relief prohibiting any retaliatory measures against\nthe EEOC's potential class members, witnesses, or their family members, as\nwell as any actions that would discourage association with those individuals.\nIt also enjoined the company from paying or offering to pay for favorable\ntestimony in the EEOC's case.[184]\nCompensatory and punitive damages are potentially available under the anti-\nretaliation provisions in accordance with the standards explained below.\n_Note:_ punitive damages are only available against private employers, not\nagainst government entities.\nUnder the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a, compensatory and\npunitive damages are available for a range of violations under Title VII,\nincluding retaliation. A cap on combined compensatory and punitive damages\n(excluding past monetary losses) ranges from $50,000 for employers with 15-100\nemployees, to $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees. Section 207\nof GINA incorporates all the same remedies available under Title VII. Punitive\ndamages are available when a practice is undertaken \"with malice or with\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved\nindividual.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1). Eligibility for punitive damages depends\non the employer's state of mind, not on the \"egregiousness\" of the employer's\nmisconduct.[185]\nCompensatory and punitive damages are available for retaliation claims brought\nunder the ADEA and the EPA, even though such relief is not available for non-\nretaliation claims under those statutes.[186] Any compensatory and punitive\ndamages obtained under the EPA and the ADEA are not subject to statutory caps.\nTitle V of the ADA sets forth the retaliation and interference provisions but\ncontains no remedy provision of its own. Among courts, there remains a split\nof authority regarding whether compensatory and punitive damages are available\nfor retaliation or interference in violation of the ADA.[187] Although the\nCivil Rights Act of 1991's damages provision does not explicitly mention\nretaliation claims under the ADA, the Commission and the U.S. Department of\nJustice maintain that compensatory and punitive damages are available for\nretaliation or interference in violation of the ADA.[188] The ADA retaliation\nprovision refers to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117 for its remedy, which in turn adopts the\nremedies set forth in Title VII at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1981a(a)(2). Moreover, the reference in the damages provision of the Civil\nRights Act of 1991 to the intentional discrimination provision of the ADA\n(section 102, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112) must encompass retaliation as a form of\nintentional discrimination. Accordingly, availability of damages for ADA and\nRehabilitation Act retaliation claims should be assessed under the standards\napplicable to Title VII.[189]\nUnder all the statutes enforced by the EEOC, relief may also potentially\ninclude back pay if the retaliation resulted in termination, constructive\ndischarge, or non-selection, as well as front pay or reinstatement. Equitable\nrelief also frequently sought by the Commission includes changes in employer\npolicies and procedures, managerial training, reporting to the Commission, and\nother measures designed to prevent violations and promote future compliance\nwith the law.\nAlthough each workplace is different, there are many different types of\npromising policy, training, and organizational changes that employers may wish\nto consider implementing in an effort to minimize the likelihood of\nretaliation violations.[190] The Commission uses the term \"promising\npractices\" here because these steps may help reduce the risk of violations.\nHowever, the Commission is aware there is not a single best approach for every\nworkplace or circumstance.\nMoreover, adopting these practices does not insulate an employer from\nliability or damages for unlawful actions. Rather, meaningful implementation\nof these steps may help reduce the risk of violations, even where they are not\nlegal requirements.\nEmployers should maintain a written, plain-language anti-retaliation policy,\nand provide practical guidance on the employer's expectations with user-\nfriendly examples of what to do and not to do. The policy should include:\nEmployers should consider any necessary revisions to eliminate punitive formal\nor informal policies that may deter employees from engaging in protected\nactivity, such as policies that would impose materially adverse actions for\ninquiring, disclosing, or otherwise discussing wages. Although most private\nemployers are under no obligation to disclose or make wages public, actions\nthat deter or punish employees with respect to pay inquiries or discussions\nmay constitute retaliation under provisions in federal and/or state law. _See\nsupra_ \u00a7 II-A.2.f. (Inquiries and Other Discussions Related to Compensation).\nEmployers should consider these ideas for training:\nAn automatic part of an employer's response and investigation following EEO\nallegations should be to provide information to all parties and witnesses\nregarding the anti-retaliation policy, how to report alleged retaliation, and\nhow to avoid engaging in it. As part of this debriefing, managers and\nsupervisors alleged to have engaged in discrimination should be provided with\nguidance on how to handle any personal feelings about the allegations when\ncarrying out management duties or interacting in the workplace.\nEmployers may wish to check in with employees, managers, and witnesses during\nthe pendency of an EEO matter to inquire if there are any concerns regarding\npotential or perceived retaliation, and to provide guidance. This provides an\nopportunity to identify issues before they fester, and to reassure employees\nand witnesses of the employer's commitment to protect against retaliation. It\nalso provides an opportunity to give ongoing support and advice to those\nmanagers and supervisors who may be named in discrimination matters that are\npending over a long period of time prior to reaching a final resolution.\nConsider ensuring that a human resources or EEO specialist, a designated\nmanagement official, in-house counsel, or other resource individual reviews\nproposed employment actions of consequence to ensure they are based on\nlegitimate non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory reasons. These reviewers\nshould:\nAdditional suggestions for reducing incidences of retaliation are available at\n_Retaliation - Making it Personal_ , Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n,\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/retaliation_considerations.cfm.\n[1] Supreme Court decisions handed down after issuance of the EEOC's 1998\n_Compliance Manual_ that concern retaliation under EEOC-enforced laws include:\n_University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar_ , 133 S. Ct. 2517\n(2013); _Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp._ , 563 U.S. 1\n(2011); _Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP_ , 562 U.S. 170 (2011);\n_Crawford v.

White_, 548 U.S. 53 (2006); and _Clark\nCounty School District v. Breeden_ , 532 U.S. 268 (2001).\n[2] Beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2009, charges of retaliation surpassed race\ndiscrimination as the most frequently alleged basis of discrimination. In FY\n2015, retaliation claims were included in 44.5% of all charges received by the\nEEOC, and 35.7% of the Title VII charges received. _See_ Charge Statistics, FY\n1997 Through FY 2015, Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n,\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/charges.cfm (last visited\nAug. 18, 2016).\n[3] In the federal sector, retaliation has been the most frequently alleged\nbasis since 2008, and between fiscal years 2009 and 2015, retaliation findings\ncomprised between 42% and 53% of all findings of EEO violations. _See_ Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Data Posted Pursuant to the No Fear Act, Equal Emp't\nOpportunity Comm'n, https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/nofear/index.cfm\n(last visited Aug. 18, 2016).\n[4] For example, complaining or threatening to complain about alleged\ndiscrimination against oneself or others may constitute protected activity.\n_See infra_ \u00a7 II-A.2.e. (Examples of Opposition). In addition, the doctrine of\nanticipatory retaliation (also called preemptive retaliation) prohibits an\nemployer from threatening adverse action against an employee who has not yet\nengaged in protected activity for the purpose of discouraging him or her from\ndoing so. _See, e.g._ , _Beckel v. Wal-Mart Assocs., Inc._ , 301 F.3d 621, 624\n(7th Cir. 2002) (holding that threatening to fire plaintiff if she sued \"would\nbe a form of anticipatory retaliation, actionable as retaliation under Title\nVII\"); _Sauers v. Salt Lake Cty._ , 1 F.3d 1122, 1128 (10th Cir. 1993)\n(\"Action taken against an individual in anticipation of that person engaging\nin protected opposition to discrimination is no less retaliatory than action\ntaken after the fact.\"). Note: issues related to waivers and releases that\nmight be retaliatory are not addressed in this guidance.\n[5] Section 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), provides:\nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate\nagainst any of his employees or applicants for employment, for an employment\nagency, or joint labor management committee controlling apprenticeship or\nother training or retraining, including on-the-job training programs, to\ndiscriminate against any individual, or for a labor organization to\ndiscriminate against any member thereof or applicant for membership, because\nhe has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this\nsubchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under\nthis subchapter.\n[6] Section 4(d) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d), provides:\nIt shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his\nemployees or applicants for employment, for an employment agency to\ndiscriminate against any individual, or for a labor organization to\ndiscriminate against any member thereof or applicant for membership, because\nsuch individual, member or applicant for membership has opposed any practice\nmade unlawful by this section, or because such individual, member or applicant\nfor membership has made a charge, tes\u00adti\u00adfied, assisted, or participated in\nany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under this chapter.\n[7] Section 503 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203, provides:\n(a) Retaliation\nNo person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual\nhas opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such\nindividual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner\nin an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.\n(b) Interference, coercion, or intimidation\nIt shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any\nindividual in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his or her having\nexercised or enjoyed, or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged\nany other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or\nprotected by this chapter.\n(c) Remedies and procedures.\nThe remedies and procedures available under sections 12117, 12133, and 12188\nof this title _[sections 107, 203 and_ _308]_ shall be available to aggrieved\npersons for violations of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, with\nrespect to subchapter I, subchapter II and subchapter III, respectively, of\nthis chapter _[title_ _I, title II and title III]_.\n[8] Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(f) (\"Standards used\nin determining violation of section\"), covering designated federal government\napplicants and employees, provides:\nThe standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a\ncomplaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this\nsection shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) and the provisions of\nsections 501 through 504, and 510, of the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990 (42 U.S.C. 12201-12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.\n[9] The EPA incorporates the anti-retaliation provision of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). This provision does not delineate\ntypes of protected activity such as opposition and participation, but its\nlanguage has been construed to prohibit retaliation for both oral and written\ncomplaints, whether made internally to an employer or externally to the EEOC\nor a state/local Fair Employment Practices Agency. _See_ _Kasten v. Saint-\nGobain Performance Plastics Corp._ , 563 U.S. 1, 14-16 (2011) (interpreting\nthe FLSA anti-retaliation provision to find that oral complaints may be\nprotected activity, but declining to decide whether internally filed\ncomplaints to management suffice), _on remand_ , 703 F.3d 966, 976 (7th Cir.\n2012) (holding that plaintiff's oral complaint to his manager was protected\nactivity); _Greathouse v.

Bostwick Labs., Inc._ , 669 F.3d 428, 432-33 (4th Cir. 2012) (ruling that\nintra-company complaints are protected activity under the FLSA, consistent\nwith the majority of circuits to have addressed the issue).\n[10] Section 207(f) of Title II of GINA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ff-6(f), provides:\nNo person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual\nhas opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such\nindividual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner\nin an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter. The remedies\nand procedures otherwise provided for under this section shall be available to\naggrieved individuals with respect to violations of this subsection.\n[11] The terms \"employer\" and \"employee\" are used throughout this document to\nrefer to all those covered under the EEO laws. The _EEOC_ _Compliance Manual\nSection 2: Threshold Issues_ (2000),\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/threshold.html, provides guidance to\ndetermine whether a particular entity is subject to these laws based on its\nsize or other characteristics, and whether a worker is considered an\n\"employee\" for purposes of the EEO laws regardless of whether called an\n\"independent contractor\" or other name. Federal employers are included as\ncovered entities prohibited from engaging in retaliation under each of the\nemployment discrimination statutes. _See_ _Gomez-Perez v. Potter_ , 553 U.S.\n474, 487 (2008) (inferring a cause of action in the federal sector for\nretaliation under the ADEA and describing \u00a7 633 of the ADEA as a \"broad\nprohibition of 'discrimination' rather than a list of specific prohibited\npractices\").\n[12] Where it appears that an allegation of retaliation raised in an EEOC\ncharge may be _solely_ subject to the jurisdiction of another federal agency\nor a state or local government, rather than EEOC, the charging party should be\nreferred promptly to the appropriate agency. For example, claims of\nretaliation for union activity should be referred to the National Labor\nRelations Board. Similarly, claims of retaliation for raising violations of\nfederal wage and hour laws, such as reprisal for raising timekeeping\nviolations, or withholding of overtime pay, should be referred to the\nDepartment of Labor, Wage and Hour Division.\n[13] _See_ 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(b); _supra_ note 7.\n[14] _Glover v.

However, the Commission disagrees with the notion\nthat this principle should be extended to allow an employer to retaliate\nagainst an employee for positions taken or manner of advocacy in an\nadversarial EEO proceeding _.

The Commission\nhas long disagreed with cases that find no protection from retaliation for\nemployees complaining of harassment because it is not yet \"severe or\npervasive\" or could not be reasonably viewed as such.\n[65] For example, asserting in a retaliation case that an employee's\ncomplaints related to sexual orientation discrimination should be deemed\nprotected activity in light of the EEOC's interpretation of Title VII, the\nCommission explained: \"To hold otherwise would require discrimination victims\nor witnesses - usually 'lay' persons - to master the subtleties of sex-\ndiscrimination law before securing safe harbor in the broad remedial\nprotections of Title VII's anti-retaliation rule.\" Brief of EEOC as Amicus\nCuriae in Support of Panel Rehearing, _Muhammad v.

A number\nof courts have since agreed with the EEOC's position that Title VII's\nprohibition on sex discrimination encompasses a prohibition on sexual\norientation discrimination. _See e.g._ , _Isaacs v. Felder Servs_., 2015 WL\n6560655, at *3 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 29, 2015); _Videckis v. Pepperdine Univ_., 2015\nWL 8916764, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2015) (Title IX case); _cf._ _Roberts v.\nUPS_ , 115 F.

Yet protection against retaliation for opposing\nsexual orientation discrimination is not limited to those jurisdictions that\nhave agreed with the EEOC. An individual is protected from retaliation for\nopposing practices that discriminate based on sexual orientation even if a\ncourt has not adopted the EEOC's position on sexual orientation\ndiscrimination. _See, e.g._ , _Birkholz v. City of New York_ , No. 10-CV-4719\n(NGG)(SMG), 2012 WL 580522, at *7-8 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2012) (\"If opposition\nto sexual-orientation-based discrimination was not protected activity,\nemployees subjected to gender stereotyping would have to base their decision\nto oppose or not oppose unlawful conduct on a brittle legal distinction\n[between sexual orientation and sex discrimination], a situation that might\nproduce a chilling effect on gender stereotyping claims.\"). Similarly, if an\nemployee requested that an employer provide her with light duty due to her\npregnancy, as provided to other employees for other reasons, the request would\nconstitute protected activity based on a reasonable good faith belief, even if\nthe legal application of the rules is new or the facts of her employer's\nworkplace may not be fully known to her. _See generally_ EEOC, Enforcement\nGuidance: Pregnancy Discrimination and Related Issues (2015),\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/pregnancy_guidance.cfm.\n[67] _See_ Brief for the Secretary of Labor and the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission as Amici Curiae in Support of Plaintiff-Appellant,\n_Rosenfield v.

City of New York_ , 795 F.3d 297, 318 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding\nthat an internal EEO director does not engage in protected opposition by\nfulfilling a job duty to report or investigate other employees' discrimination\ncomplaints, but that actively supporting other employees in exercising Title\nVII rights, personally complaining, or being critical of discriminatory\nemployment practices is opposition); _Collazo v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Mfg.,\nInc._ , 617 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir. 2010) (reasoning that \"an employer cannot be\npermitted to avoid liability for retaliation simply by crafting equal\nemployment policies that require its employees to report unlawful employment\npractices,\" and holding that even assuming _arguendo_ that a \"step outside\"\nrule applies under Title VII, plaintiff stepped outside his managerial duties\nwhen he supported a subordinate in lodging and pursuing a sexual harassment\ncomplaint and was therefore protected).\n[69] _Warren_ , 24 F.

SunGard Data Sys._ , 109 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir.\n1997) (ruling that district court erroneously dismissed plaintiff's\nretaliation claim because termination occurred nearly one year after her\nprotected activity; when there may be reasons why adverse action was not taken\nimmediately, absence of immediacy does not disprove causation); _Shirley v.\nChrysler First, Inc._ , 970 F.2d 39, 44 (5th Cir. 1992).\n[164] _See, e.g._ , _M_ _u\u00f1oz_ , 671 F.3d at 56-57 (concluding that evidence\nsupported jury's finding that plaintiff, a doctor, was discharged in\nretaliation for ADEA lawsuit filed 5 years earlier, where the evidence showed\nplaintiff was fired for common conduct for which others were not disciplined,\nhe was not given an opportunity to defend himself, and had been threatened\nyears earlier by one of the decisionmakers that if he filed the suit he would\nnever work at the hospital or in Puerto Rico again); _Rao v. Tex. Parks &\nWildlife Dep't_, No. 4:13-cv-0726, 2014 WL 1846102, at *3 (S.D. Tex. May 8,\n2014) (holding that denial of promotion could be shown to be in retaliation\nfor complaint filed three years earlier, where decisionmaker said to plaintiff\n\"you didn't do anything wrong, but you filed that complaint\").\n[165] _Davis v. Team Elec. Co._ , 520 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2008);\n_Goldsmith v. Babgy Elevator Co._ , 513 F.3d 1261, 1278 (11th Cir. 2008);\n_Hamilton v. Gen. Elec.

Gates Rubber Co._ , 647 F.3d 704, 709-10 (7th\nCir. 2011) (concluding that evidence of plant manager's statement to African-\nAmerican employee that he was \"playing the race card\" was sufficient to deny\nemployer's motion for summary judgment on claim of retaliatory termination for\nrace discrimination complaints); _Abbott_ , 348 F.3d at 544 (ruling that\nsummary judgment for employer on retaliation claim was improper where evidence\nshowed supervisor stated he would \"get back at those who had supported the\ncharge of discrimination,\" told plaintiff he was being discharged for bringing\n\"the morale of the shop down,\" and told the managing partner he fired\nplaintiff because he had put his nose in other people's business by testifying\nin support of coworker's discrimination allegations).\n[167] _See, e.g., Burnell_ , 647 F.3d at 709-10 (ruling summary judgment for\nemployer improper based on evidence that included statements made to\nplaintiff); _Abbott_ , 348 F.3d at 544 (ruling summary judgment for employer\nimproper based on statements made both to plaintiff and to others).\n[168] _Spengler v. Worthington Cylinders_ , 615 F.3d 481, 494-95 (6th Cir.\n2010) (concluding that evidence showed that plaintiff, who was discharged\nafter raising an age discrimination allegation, was a valuable employee and\nthat the rule pursuant to which he was terminated had been selectively\nenforced).\n[169] _See supra_ notes 113 and 116.\n[170] _Pantoja v. Am. NTN Bearing Mfg. Corp._ , 495 F.3d 840, 851 (7th Cir.\n2007) (ruling that inconsistent explanations by employer presented issue for\njury); _Loudermilk v. Best Pallet Co._ , 636 F.3d 312, 315 (7th Cir. 2011)\n(ruling that pretext could be shown because between the EEOC investigation and\nthe litigation, the employer shifted its explanation for plaintiff's\ntermination from reduction in force to mutual decision and then to violation\nof a company policy).\n[171] _See, e.g._ , _Tuli v. Brigham & Women's Hosp._, 656 F.3d 33, 42 (1st\nCir. 2011) (concluding that although supervisor contended that his actions\nwere designed simply to give credential review committee a legitimate\nassessment of complaints against plaintiff, the evidence showed he overstated\nhis objections and failed to disclose that he had been the subject of several\nprior complaints by plaintiff, which could lead the jury to conclude that his\nmotives were attributable to discriminatory and/or retaliatory animus);\n_Spengler_ , 615 F.3d at 495 (ruling that pretext could be shown because\nemployer's explanation that seasonal employees are discharged after 12 months\nwas inconsistent with testimony that the policy was only applied in the event\nof a production slowdown, which had not occurred); _Franklin v. Local 2 of the\nSheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n_ , 565 F.3d 508, 521 (8th Cir. 2009) (ruling\nthat defendant's reading aloud at union meetings of legal bills identifying\nemployees who had filed discrimination charges against the union may have been\nretaliatory, since degree of detail disclosed was not necessary given\nproffered non-retaliatory explanation that it was done in order to obtain\nmember approval for expenditures).\n[172] As discussed _supra_ note 145, an employer can be liable under \"cat's\npaw\" theory where an individual due to retaliatory animus influenced a\ndecisionmaker who did not know of the protected conduct or animus.\n[173] _See, e.g._ , _Stephens v. Erickson_ , 569 F.3d 779, 788 (7th Cir. 2009)\n(holding that plaintiff failed to show that interviewers who scored his oral\ninterview were aware of his previous discrimination complaints).\n[174] _See Etienne v. Spanish Lake Truck & Casino Plaza, LLC_, 547 F. App'x\n484, 489-90 (5th Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for the employer on a\nTitle VII retaliation claim, the court applied _Nassar_ and concluded that the\nemployee failed to show that retaliatory motive was the \"but-for\" cause for\nher discharge, not merely a motivating factor).\n[175] The ADA interference provision uses the same language as a parallel\nprovision in the Fair Housing Act, and Congress intended it to be interpreted\nin the same way. H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 138 (1990), _as_ _reprinted\nin_ 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 421 (\"The Committee intends that the interpretation\ngiven by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to a similar\nprovision in the Fair Housing Act . . . be used as a basis for regulations for\nthis section.\"). The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) also contains an\ninterference provision with similar language to the ADA provision. _See_ 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (making it unlawful under the NLRA for an employer \"to\ninterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights\nguaranteed in [the Act]\").\n[176] _See Brown v. City of Tucson_ , 336 F.3d 1181, 1192 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(holding that in comparison to the retaliation provision, the interference\nprovision protects a broader class of persons against less clearly defined\nwrongs; demands that plaintiff stop taking her medications and perform duties\ncontrary to her medical restrictions or be forcibly retired constituted\nactionable interference).\n[177] The EEOC regulation implementing the interference provision additionally\nincludes the term \"harass.\" _See_ 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.12(b) (providing it is\n\"unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, harass, or interfere with any\nindividual in the exercise or enjoyment of, or because the individual aided or\nencouraged any other individual in the exercise of, any right granted or\nprotected by this part\"). The inclusion of the term \"harass\" in the regulation\nis intended to characterize the type of adverse treatment that may in some\ncircumstances violate the interference provision.\n[178] _Brown_ , 336 F.3d at 1192-93 (ruling that the ADA's interference\nprovision is not so broad as to prohibit \"'any action whatsoever that in any\nway hinders a member of a protected class,'\" and observing that supervisor's\nstatement that other employees were complaining about plaintiff's long lunches\nand early departures did not alone violate the interference provision)\n(citation omitted).\n[179] _See_ Brief of the EEOC as Amicus Curiae in Support of the Plaintiff-\nAppellant, _Brown v. City of Tucson_ , 336 F.3d 1181 (9th Cir. 2003) (No.\n01-16938).\n[180] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(2) (\"Whenever a charge is filed . . . and the\nCommission concludes on the basis of a preliminary investigation that prompt\njudicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act, the\nCommission . . . may bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary\nrelief pending final disposition of such charge.\"); 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117 (ADA); 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000ff-6(a) (GINA).\n[181] _EEOC v.

Ky. 1985)\n(granting preliminary injunction preventing defendant from mandatorily\nretiring police department employee because of his age; although plaintiff\ncould have collected back pay and been reinstated at later time, he would have\nsuffered from inability to keep up with current matters in police department\nand would have suffered anxiety or emotional problems due to compulsory\nretirement).\n[182] _Garcia v. Lawn_ , 805 F.2d 1400, 1405-06 (9th Cir. 1986).\n[183] _Id_. (ruling that the employer's retaliation would have a chilling\neffect on other employees' willingness to exercise their rights or testify for\nplaintiff, and therefore would cause irreparable harm); _cf._ _EEOC v. Peters'\nBakery_ , 13-CV-04507-BLF (N.D. Cal. preliminary injunction issued July 2015)\n(ruling that harassment about the pending claim, combined with the likelihood\nof success on the merits, may support entry of a preliminary injunction\nprohibiting an employer from terminating an employee during the pendency of a\nfederal EEO lawsuit, because \"permitting [the individual] to be terminated\nunder such circumstances may well have a chilling effect on other employees\nwho might wish to file charges with the EEOC, and thus could interfere with\nthe EEOC's mission\").\n[184] _See EEOC v. Evans Fruit Co._ , No. CV-10-3033-LRS, 2010 WL 2594960, at\n*1-2 (E.D. Wash. June 24, 2010) (granting EEOC's request for preliminary\ninjunction while the investigation continues) (citing the likelihood of\nirreparable injury if alleged witness tampering was allowed to continue, in\nthat \"(a) the Commission's prosecution of its case is likely to be chilled;\n(b) the Commission's investigation of retaliation charges now pending . . . is\nlikely to be chilled; and (c) current and past . . . employees are likely to\nbe deterred from exercising their rights under Title VII\").\n[185] _Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n_ , 527 U.S. 526, 535 (1999).\n[186] The FLSA, as amended in 1977, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), authorizes\ncompensatory and punitive damages for retaliation claims under both the EPA\nand the ADEA. _See Moore v. Freeman_ , 355 F.3d 558, 563-64 (6th Cir. 2004);\n_Moskowitz v. Trs. of Purdue Univ._ , 5 F.3d 279, 283-84 (7th Cir. 1993).\n[187] _Compare_ _Edwards v. Brookhaven Sci. Assocs._ , 390 F. Supp. 2d 225,\n236 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (ruling that compensatory and punitive damages for\nretaliation are available under the ADA), and _Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor\nFuels, Inc._ , 242 F. Supp. 2d 236, 240-41 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (same), _with_\n_Alvarado v. Cajun Operating Co._ , 588 F.3d 1261, 1264-70 (9th Cir. 2009)\n(ruling that compensatory and punitive damages are not available for ADA\nretaliation), _and Kramer v. Banc of Am. Sec._ , 355 F.3d 961, 964-66 (7th\nCir. 2004) (same). Several appellate courts, without analyzing the\navailability of compensatory damages, have affirmed awards to plaintiffs who\nhave prevailed in retaliation claims under the ADA. _See, e.g._ , _Salitros v.\nChrysler Corp._ , 306 F.3d 562, 570 (8th Cir. 2002); _EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc._ , 187 F.3d 1241, 1248-49 (10th Cir. 1999); _Muller v. Costello_ , 187\nF.3d 298, 314-15 (2d Cir. 1999).\n[188] _See_ Brief of the EEOC as Amicus Curiae in Support of Plaintiff-\nAppellee Cross-Appellant, _Mascarella v. CPlace Univ. SNF_ , No. 15-30970 (5th\nCir. filed June 10, 2016),\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/litigation/briefs/mascarella.html.\n[189] Although some courts have held that state government employers may have\nsovereign immunity from retaliation claims by individuals for money damages\nunder the ADA, _see, e.g._ , _Demshki v. Monteith_ , 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th\nCir. 2001), such employers are still subject to suit by the U.S. government,\nwhich can obtain full relief including damages for the individual. _Bd. of\nTrs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett_ , 531 U.S. 356, 374 n.9 (2001); _United\nStates v. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety_ , 321 F.3d 495, 499 (5th Cir. 2003).\nTherefore it is in the interest of such employers to take the same care as all\nothers to comply with retaliation prohibitions.\n[190] A number of these practices were developed from testimony and discussion\nat the EEOC's _Meeting on Retaliation in the Workplace: Causes, Remedies, and\nStrategies for Prevention_ , held on June 17, 2015.
